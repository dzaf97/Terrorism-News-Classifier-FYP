"Islamic State not defeated, just transforming: experts","Even as the last pockets of resistance in eastern Syria hold their ground, the Islamic State group is shapeshifting into a new, but no less dangerous, underground form, experts warn. Also known as ISIS, or the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the group had long been ready to cede the territory it once held in its self-styled “caliphate,” and has already begun the switch to a more clandestine role, closer to its roots. “ISIS anticipated its battlefield defeat and the loss of the caliphate and prepared accordingly,” said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University in Washington. “Hundreds of ISIS fighters were able to flee Syria, bribe their way through Syria to Turkey and thereby disappear,” he said. “Beneath the surface, ISIS has always played the long game.” In a recent study entitled “ISIS’s Second Resurgence,” Brandon Wallace and Jennifer Cafarella of the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said the jihadist group “has already restructured its operations to return to a regional insurgency.” “ISIS is finding new sources of revenue and rebuilding command-and-control over its scattered remnant forces in order to prepare for a future large-scale insurgency in both Iraq and Syria,” the report said. The group has managed to smuggle funds to several countries around the Middle East, using front companies such as car dealerships, electronics stores, pharmacies and currency exchanges that it established in Iraq, experts said. “We’re entering a very risky period,” said Seth Jones of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). “I have no faith that ISIS has been crushed, defeated.” “They already have gone underground,” he said. “They are doing what everybody does who faces a better-equipped opposition, with air and naval capabilities: they have to face Russian air strikes, cruise missiles.” “What do you do in a case like that?” he said. “You disperse, you don’t operate in platoon-size positions the way they did in 2014, you go underground, you build your clandestine network, you conduct targeted assassinations, IEDs [roadside bombs] and you wait for opportunities.” Data collected by the CSIS show that in some provinces in Iraq, such as Kirkuk in the northeast, the number of attacks attributed to IS doubled last year from 2017, with an average of 75 a month. The group has regularly picked off tribal leaders, government officials, police and members of the armed forces. In a television interview last month, the Iraqi Kurdish leader Massud Barzani said that IS “is not defeated and will not be ended easily.” “IS was on the ground, now they are underground,” Barzani said, noting that they had returned to many areas they had been driven out of even stronger than before. An Islamic State fighter in Syria, who spoke to The New York Times via WhatsApp, echoed Barzani’s grim message. “Do you think the Americans can defeat the caliphate?” said the fighter, who identified himself only as Yehya. “It’s a war of attrition. When the coalition stops the air strikes, we will return immediately.” “We didn’t leave for good. We’re still in Syria, even in the areas that you think we left. We still have our suicide bombers ready to attack. Our informers are active,” he said. Hoffman agreed that the US and Russia are locked in a war of attrition against the Islamists, “and frankly we’re losing it. There are nearly a quarter of a million salafi-jihadi fighters all around the world.” That is four times the number of jihadists there were in 2001, when Al-Qaeda triggered the global “war on terror” with its jetliner suicide attacks on the United States. Hoffman said that while military operations may have held them at bay, Islamic State operatives “carry within their own DNA the seeds to constantly regenerate, to continue to attract, recruit.” “Who would have thought in the immediate aftermath of September 11 that 17 years later, we would still be fighting?” he said."
"Two dead, 11 wounded in car bomb in northern Iraqi city Tal Afar","BAGHDAD (Reuters) – At least two people were killed and 11 wounded on Tuesday by a car bomb in the northern Iraqi city of Tal Afar, a former Islamic State stronghold, the military said. Tal Afar, about 80 km (50 miles) west of Mosul, experienced cycles of sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shi’ites after the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, and produced some of Islamic State’s most senior commanders. The city, which had about 200,000 residents, came under the militants’ control when Islamic State overran swathes of Iraq’s north in 2014. It fell to Iraqi Security Forces, backed by the US-led coalition, in August 2017, the last area to be retaken in the north before fighting moved to the Syrian border. A heavy security presence has remained since then and the city has been mostly quiet."
"Bomb kills three Vietnamese tourists, Egyptian guide near pyramids: officials","CAIRO (Reuters) – Three Vietnamese tourists and an Egyptian guide were killed and at least 10 others injured when a roadside bomb blast hit their tour bus on Friday less than 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from Egypt’s world-famous Giza pyramids, authorities said. The bombing is the first deadly attack against foreign tourists in Egypt for over a year and comes as the tourism sector, a vital source of foreign currency revenue, recovers from a sharp drop in visitor numbers since the country’s 2011 uprising. No immediate claim of responsibility was reported. Islamist extremists, including militants linked to Islamic State, are active in Egypt and have targeted foreign visitors in the past. At least nine Vietnamese tourists were injured, as well as the Egyptian driver, according to official statements. The tourists were heading to a sound and light show at the pyramids, which they had visited earlier in the day, said Lan Le, 41, who was also aboard the bus but unhurt. “We were going to the sound and light show and then suddenly we heard a bomb. It was terrible, people screaming,” she told Reuters, speaking at Al Haram hospital, where the injured were taken. “I don’t remember anything after.” Egypt’s interior ministry said the bus was hit by an explosion from an improvised device hidden near a wall at around 1815 local time (1615 GMT). About two hours later the vehicle could be seen behind a police cordon with one of its sides badly damaged and the windows blown out, a Reuters reporter said. Dozens of police, military and firefighters were at the site, on a narrow sidestreet close to the ring road, where traffic was moving normally. Shortly afterward, workers brought a pick-up truck to tow the bus away. An investigator at the scene said the device had likely been planted near the wall. The interior ministry confirmed the death of two of the tourists, and the state prosecutor’s office later said a third had died. In total, 14 Vietnamese tourists had been traveling on the bus, it said. Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly told local TV from Al Haram hospital that the guide had died from his injuries. “The bus deviated from the route secured by the security forces,” Madbouly told Extra News channel, an assertion also made by the owner of the company that organized the bus tour. “We have been in contact with the embassy of Vietnam to contain the impact of the incident, and what is important now is to take care of the injured,” the prime minister said. The bus driver later told local media he had not deviated from the route. Egypt’s army and police launched a major campaign against militant groups in February, targeting the Sinai Peninsula as well as southern areas and the border with Libya. UAE reopens Damascus embassy in boost for Assad The government says fighting Islamist militants is a priority as it works to restore stability after the years of turmoil that followed the “Arab Spring” protests of 2011. Those events and the bombing of a Russian airliner shortly after it took off from Sharm el Sheikh in 2015 caused tourist numbers to plunge. The last deadly attack on foreign tourists in Egypt was in July 2017, when two Germans were stabbed to death in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada."
Police probe hoax bitcoin bomb threats across US,"(Reuters) – U.S. law enforcement officials on Friday were investigating a wave of hoax emailed bomb threats demanding bitcoin payment that caused worry but no damage in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. On Thursday in North America, hundreds of businesses, government offices and schools received awkwardly-worded letters threatening to set off explosives if payments of $20,000 in cryptocurrency were not received. The threats led to scattered evacuations of schools and transit stations before the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies dismissed them as lacking credibility. Hoax threats were received in cities including Washington, New York, Detroit, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Oklahoma City, Grand Rapids, Iowa, Denver, Ottawa and Calgary, Alberta. Investigators do not yet know who was responsible, two federal officials said on Friday. There is no evidence to suggest that any of the recipients made ransom payments, one of the officials said. Cisco Systems Inc’s (CSCO.O) Talos cyber security unit said it believes the threats came from a group of fraudsters previously responsible for sending “sextortion” emails that claim to have videos showing the recipients having sex. The fraudsters threaten to release compromising videos they claim to have obtained with software that recorded people through webcams on their computers. Some of this week’s bomb threats came from the same internet addresses used in those sextortion campaigns, Talos researcher Jaeson Schultz said in a blog post. “The criminals conducting these extortion email attacks have demonstrated that they are willing to concoct any threat and story imaginable that they believe would fool the recipient,” the blog said. “We expect these sorts of attacks to continue as long as there are victims who will believe these threats to be credible, and be scared enough to send money to the attackers,” it said. A similar series of hoax bomb threats occurred in December 2015, prompting officials in Los Angeles to close the city’s public school system, which national law enforcement officials later criticized as an over-reaction. Two weeks previously, a married couple inspired by Islamic State had killed 14 people at a California county office building in a shooting rampage. A teenager with dual Israeli-U.S. citizenship was arrested in Israel in March 2017 for making bomb threats to more than 100 Jewish organizations and Jewish community centers in dozens of U.S. states over several months."
Authorities: Wave of hoax bomb threats made across US,"By the Associated Press A wave of bomb threats emailed Thursday to hundreds of schools, businesses and government buildings across the U.S. triggered searches, evacuations and fear — but there were no signs of explosives, and authorities said the scare appeared to be a crude extortion attempt. Law enforcement agencies across the country dismissed the threats, saying they were meant to cause disruption and compel recipients into sending money and were not considered credible. Some of the emails had the subject line: “Think Twice.” They were sent from a spoofed email address. The sender claimed to have had an associate plant a small bomb in the recipient’s building and that the only way to stop him from setting it off was by making an online payment of $20,000 in Bitcoin. “We are currently monitoring multiple bomb threats that have been sent electronically to various locations throughout the city,” the New York City Police Department’s counterterrorism unit tweeted. “These threats are also being reported to other locations nationwide & are NOT considered credible at this time.” Other law enforcement agencies also dismissed the threats, which were written in a choppy style reminiscent of the Nigerian prince email scam. The Palm Beach County, Florida, sheriff’s office and the Boise, Idaho, police said they had no reason to believe that threats made to locations in those areas were credible. One of the emails wound up in a spam filter, Boise Police Chief William Bones said. The FBI said it is assisting law enforcement agencies that are dealing with the threats. “As always, we encourage the public to remain vigilant and to promptly report suspicious activities which could represent a threat to public safety,” the FBI said in a statement. Thursday’s scare came less than two months after prominent Democratic officials and CNN’s Manhattan offices were targeted with package bombs. The suspect in that case, Cesar Sayoc, is in jail while awaiting trial. In 2015, an emailed bomb threat prompted different reactions from the nation’s two largest public school systems. The Los Angeles school system closed down under threat of a mass attack, but New York City officials quickly saw it as a hoax. In the wake of Thursday’s emails, some schools across the country closed early and others were evacuated or placed on lockdown. Authorities said a threat emailed to a school in Troy, Missouri, about 55 miles (88 kilometers) northeast of St. Louis, was sent from Russia. The bomb threats also prompted evacuations at city hall in Aurora, Illinois, the offices of the News & Observer in Raleigh, North Carolina, a suburban Atlanta courthouse and businesses in Detroit. “Organizations nationwide, both public and private, have reported receiving emailed bomb threats today,” Michigan State Police spokeswoman Shannon Banner said. “They are not targeted toward any one specific sector.” Penn State University notified students via a text alert about threats to a half-dozen buildings and an airport on its main campus in State College, Pennsylvania. In an update, the school said the threat appeared to be part of a “national hoax.” Officials at Columbine High School in Colorado were dealing Thursday with a bomb threat of a different sort. Students were being kept inside for the rest of the school day after someone called in a bomb threat against the school. The Jefferson County, Colorado, Sheriff’s Office said the caller claimed to have placed explosive devices in the school and to be hiding outside with a gun. Sheriff’s spokesman Mike Taplin said nothing was found at Columbine, where 12 students and a teacher were killed by two students in 1999. Two dozen other Colorado schools were also temporarily placed on lockout, meaning their doors were locked but classes continued normally, as the threat was investigated."
" Iran’s Rouhani says sanctions may lead to drugs, refugee, bomb ‘deluge’ ","DUBAI (Reuters) – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani predicted a “deluge” of drugs, refugees and attacks on the West if U.S. sanctions weaken Iran’s ability to contain them. “I warn those who impose sanctions that if Iran’s ability to fight drugs and terrorism are affected … you will not be safe from a deluge of drugs, asylum seekers, bombs and terrorism,” Rouhani said in a speech carried live on state television. Separately, Foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was quoted as saying that the United States is selling more arms into the Middle East than the region needs, making it a “tinderbox”. U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a multilateral nuclear deal with Iran in May and reimposed sanctions on Iran’s vital oil industry last month. Drug trafficking is a serious challenge for Iran as it borders Afghanistan – the world’s largest opium producer – and Pakistan, a major transit country for drugs. “We spend $800 million a year to fight drugs which ensures the health of nations stretching from of Eastern Europe to the American West and North Africa to West Asia. Imagine what a disaster there would be if there is a breach in the dam,” Rouhani said. In 2012, Iran accounted for two thirds of the world’s opium seizures and one fourth of the world’s heroin and morphine seizures, a U.N. report published in 2014 showed. “We have been just as determined in the fight against terrorism … sacrificing hundreds of valuable troops and spending millions of dollars annually,” Rouhani said. “We don’t expect the West to pay their share, but they should know that sanctions hurt Iran’s capacity to fight drugs and terrorism,” Rouhani added. Iran, a key supporter of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria’s civil war, has sent military advisers as well as materiel and regional Shi’ite militias to fight militant groups. In Iraq, Iranian-backed militias and their Iranian advisers helped Iraq defeat Islamic State. “Economic terrorism means creating horror in a country and create fear in other countries that intend to invest (there). America’s withdrawal from the (nuclear accord) is undoubtedly a clear example of economic terrorism,” Rouhani told a meeting of heads of parliaments of China, Russia, and four other countries. More than 700,000 undocumented Afghans have returned from Iran this year as the Iranian economy tightens, according to data from the U.N.’s migration agency, and Iranian media said some Afghans were seeking to enter Turkey to reach Europe. Zarif warned about the dangers of large U.S. arms sales in the Middle East, where Iran’s regional rival Saudi Arabia is a major buyer of Western weapons. “The Americans have turned the region into a tinderbox. The level of arms sales by the Americans is unbelievable and much beyond regional needs and this points to the very dangerous policies followed by the Americans,” IRNA reported Zarif as saying."
Three dead in suicide attack on Libyan foreign ministry,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) – At least three people were killed when suicide bombers attacked Libya’s foreign ministry in Tripoli on Tuesday, the health ministry said. The assailants were suspected to be Islamic State militants, a security source said. The three attackers began their assault with a car bomb, damaging vehicles and buildings, and then opened fire on the ministry. Two managed to get inside and blow themselves up. The other was killed by ministry guards, the source said. Heavy smoke rose from the building which was surrounded by security forces as people were rushed to hospital. The health ministry said at least eleven people were wounded. The ministry denounced the attack on its employees, saying: “the Libyan people are waging a war on terrorism on behalf of the world.” Suicide bombers have targeted a number of Libya’s vital institutions as militant groups take advantage of the chaotic political situation. A source from Tripoli Revolutionaries Brigade, one of the strongest armed groups in the capital, told Reuters their spokesman, Abdulrahman Mazoughi, died in the attack."
Nine more arrested in Morocco over murder of Scandinavian tourists,"OSLO/RABAT (Reuters) – Moroccan police have arrested nine more people in an investigation into the murder of two Scandinavian female tourists by suspected Islamic State militants, authorities said on Friday. Four suspects were already under arrest over the killing of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark, and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway, whose bodies were found on Monday in the Atlas Mountains with knife wounds to the neck. The North African country’s Central Bureau for Judicial Investigations said nine further arrests were made in various Moroccan cities over suspected links to the killers. It said electronic devices, an unauthorized hunting rifles, knives and materials that could be used for bomb-making were found in the course of the raids. Moroccan authorities have said the four suspects first arrested over the murder had pledged allegiance to Islamic State in a video posted on social media before the killings. In Norway, police said a separate video, purportedly showing the killings of the two tourists, was probably authentic. Further technical analysis of the video was needed, Norway’s National Crime Investigation Service said earlier on Friday. “We still believe, however, that we have grounds to say that so far, there is nothing concrete to show that this video is not real,” it said in a statement. Danish counterparts said they were still analyzing the video, while Moroccan authorities said on Thursday they working on authenticating it. Jespersen and Ueland were killed on the way to Toubkal, North Africa’s highest peak and a popular hiking destination. A source from Imlil, the village near where the two friends were killed, said one of them was found dead inside their tent while the body of the other was found outside. Compared to other countries in North Africa, Morocco has seen relatively few Islamist attacks. The last major one was in April 2011, when 17 people were killed in the bombing of a restaurant in Marrakech. Later on Friday, Norwegians planned to march with torches through Bryne, the coastal hometown of Maren Ueland, to express solidarity with her family. On Saturday, a gathering will be held outside the Norwegian Embassy in the Moroccan capital Rabat in support of the families of the victims and to condemn terrorism. Thousands of people have said on Facebook that they would attend."
Canadian gets 40 years for IS-inspired plot against New York,"A Canadian man who plotted to bomb the New York subway and Times Square and “create the next 9/11” in support of the Islamic State group was sentenced Wednesday to 40 years in prison. Abdulrahman El Bahnasawy, 20, of Mississauga, Canada, pleaded guilty two years ago to seven counts of terrorism-related offenses following his arrest in May 2016. But the charges against him were kept under seal until October 2017 while US authorities sought other participants in the plot. According to the Justice Department, El Bahnasawy launched the plot together with a US citizen living in Pakistan, Talha Haroon, and Philippines native and resident Russell Salic. El Bahnasawy scouted out possible attack locations in New York, including bombing targets and concert venues where he would shoot people, with his target date in mid-2016. The Justice Department said he had acquired materials to make bombs and a place to stay just outside of the city from which to stage the attacks. “Demonstrating his commitment to carry out the attacks, El Bahnasawy pinpointed bomb locations on a map of the subway system, and acquired an array of bomb-making materials. El Bahnasawy aspired, in his words, to ‘create the next 9/11,'” said Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney from New York. Haroon had planned to fly to the United States to take part while Salic wired money from the Philippines to help them. The plot was disrupted by an FBI agent who posed as an Islamic State supporter ready to take part in the plot, the Justice Department said. El Bahnasawy was arrested after he traveled to the New York City area to prepare for the attacks. Haroon was arrested in Pakistan in September 2016 and Salic was arrested in the Philippines in April 2017. Both are still being held and face extradition requests from the United States."
Somali man arrested in Italy after comments about attacking Vatican: police,"By Reuters ROME (Reuters) – Italian police said on Monday they had arrested a 20-year-old Somali man suspected of having been a member of Islamic State and who had threatened to bomb churches in Italy, including St. Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican. They told reporters in the southern city of Bari that the man, identified as Omar Moshin Ibrahim, was detained last Thursday and that a magistrate had charged him on Monday with instigating terrorism and supporting terrorism. Police said Ibrahim was stopped following a month-long surveillance operation as he was about to leave Bari where he worked for a cleaning company. The investigation, the police officials said, included wiretaps in which Ibrahim was heard telling someone, “Let’s put bombs in all the churches of Italy. Where is the largest church? It is in Rome.” In another conversation, they said, he was heard praising those who “killed on the path of Allah” and hailing last week’s shooting at the Strasbourg Christmas market in which a gunman killed five people. Police added that the man used the alias of Anas Khalil and called himself “Yusuf” on social media, and had arrived in Italy in 2016. He was suspected of having been a militant of Islamic State previously. Italian police have increased security around churches, including St. Peter’s, ahead of Christmas, which draws big crowds to the Vatican area."
"Engineer, 32, who posted Islamic State propaganda videos on Facebook is jailed for seven years","A civil engineer and father-of-one who shared videos encouraging people to 'support, justify and glorify the actions of Islamic State' has been jailed for seven years. Abdulrahman Alcharbati, 32, shared links to the horrific videos on his Facebook page in the early hours of February 8 last year, with a judge saying they had been 'intended to encourage acts of terrorism'. During his trial at Newcastle Crown Court, it was also revealed jurors were told how one of the films showed Syrian soldiers being violently beaten to death and dragged away. His Facebook page had been suspended eight times between December 2016 and March 2017 - but he managed to get it reinstated on each occasion by claiming that he was merely 'exposing what was happening' and that he needed to use the site for work. The court also heard how another of the videos depicted young children at an orphanage being given Islamic State 'indoctrination' and being taught how to be a 'thorn in the side of enemies of religion'. Alcharbati, who was born in Syria, also uploaded a link to a film of people celebrating in the aftermath of a suicide bombing. He was convicted of six counts of disseminating terrorist material, relating to the postings he made in February 2017, and was also found guilty of possessing a 'bomb-making' manual. Jurors were told how the manual, which was discovered on his phone following his arrest on May 3, 2017, provided guidance on how to make suicide vests. Sentencing him to seven years in jail on Friday, Judge Paul Sloan QC said: 'These were links to extremist Islamic videos, Isis inspired videos which glorified terrorism and were intended to encourage acts of terrorism. 'In my view, your repeated claims that your intention was simply to share and shed light on what was happening is not credible. 'Your offending is aggravated by the fact that you failed to heed what were, in effect, repeated warnings from Facebook.' The judge added that Alcharbati, of Westholme Gardens, Newcastle, was someone who 'clearly had terrorist motivations', saying that his other Facebook posts were characterised by an antipathy towards the Syrian government, made worse by the death of his brother in Syria in 2015. Dan Pawson-Pounds, prosecuting, said: 'They were a series of videos which, of themselves, had one purpose, to support, justify and glorify the actions of Islamic State groups.' The court heard how Alcharbati, who has been diagnosed as bipolar, claimed that he suffered from a 'manic episode' when he made the posts. Bunty Batra, defending, told how the defendant has been on 'hunger strike' since Tuesday, as 'he believes he should be in a hospital, rather than a prison'. Detective Chief Superintendent Martin Snowden, of Counter Terrorism Policing North East, said that Alcharbati's postings 'encouraged others to carry out terrorist activity'. He added: ' He was also found to have downloaded an instructional guide which contained detailed instructions on how to make a suicide vest. 'While there was no evidence to indicate the purpose for the possession of this material, or any intended distribution of it, the very fact that it was downloaded is deeply concerning.'"
Man dies ‘after being found naked in the street’ and another injured in ‘connected’ attacks,"A man has died and another has been seriously injured after suspected connected attacks in Stockton. Two men have been arrested and remain in police custody over violence in the Parkfield area of the town on Sunday morning. A resident told TeessideLive he saw a man lying naked in the street with cuts to his face and body as people shouted 'we're going to kill you'. Police arrived and put a man into a van as officers tried to speak to the injured party, but he appeared to have died, the resident said. This was the second of two incidents this morning - Cleveland Police said the first incident occurred at around 4.30am, when officers were called to a report of an alleged serious assault on Yarm Road. A man was taken to hospital where he is being treated for a fractured skull and other injuries to his body and he is in stable condition. Officers were then called to nearby Westbourne Street at 7.15am, where a man had suffered serious injuries to his body. He was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead. The identity and ages of the victims have not yet been released, and police have also not said for what offences the two men have been arrested under suspicion of. Officers have not said how the victims were injured but the ambulance service said two men were taken to hospital with stab wounds. Westbourne Street remained cordoned off close to the junction with Shaftebury Street on Sunday morning. Crime scene officers could be seen in white suits carrying out investigations, placing items in clear evidence bags. Armed police are also understood to have attended. Blood could be seen on the road while an item of dark clothing was left by the kerb. The street comprises mainly rented accommodation and there are several hostels in the area. Worshipers returning from Sunday morning prayers at the Farooq E Azad Mosque and Islamic Centre at the end of the street witnessed the horrific sight. One resident told TeessideLive he saw a man lying naked face down in then street with serious injuries. He said: 'The guy was laid naked on the street and the coppers had just pulled up. 'People on the street were shouting at a man ""we're going to kill you"".' He said the injured man had cuts to his face and body and police tried to speak to him but he believed he had died. A man was put into a police van, he said. Both the injured man and the man spoken to by police 'looked English' and were 'young lads', he said. Police are increasing patrols in the area. Detective Superintendent Warren Shepheard said: 'We understand the levels of concern caused by incidents of this nature and increased patrols will remain in the area while enquiries continue. 'Please approach our officers with any concerns you may have and they will happily assist.' A spokesman for the North East Ambulance Service said they were called at 7.30am to reports of an assault. Two paramedic ambulances, a rapid response vehicle and the HEMS medic from the Great North Air Ambulance attended. The spokesman said: 'We treated and took to hospital two patients suffering stab wounds, head injuries, abdominal injuries and blood loss.' He said they were initially called to help one man in his 30s. 'But when were called there it was very clear there was a second patient needing assistance as well,' he said."
Man in his 20s is stabbed in front of stunned Christmas shoppers in west London,"Horrified Christmas shoppers looked on in horror this morning as a man was stabbed in a busy London street. The victim, who is in his 20s, was set upon in the busy Chiswick High Road, west London shortly after 11am today. Police are hunting the attacker and are awaiting news from the hospital on the extent of the victim's injuries. Locals reported a police helicopter flew over the scene to help officers track down the attacker, who is still at large. A witness tweeted: 'Holy sh**, someone got stabbed on the High Street while I was shopping, I'm shook.' A spokesman for Hounslow police said: 'Police were called at around 11.2hrs on Friday, 21 December to reports of a stabbing in Chiswick High Road, Turnham Green. Officers attended along with the London Ambulance Service. A man, believed to be in his 20s, was at the scene with stab injuries. He has been taken to hospital - we await an update on condition. 'No arrest have been made and enquiries continue. 'If you have info about this incident, call police on 101 ref 2713/21DEC or Crimestoppers anonymously 0800555111'"
I Shot The Sheriff is played during French TV news report on terrorist killing,"Stunned viewers heard the Bob Marley hit 'I Shot The Sheriff' being played in the background during a French TV news report about Cherif Chekatt being killed by armed police. The 1973 song was being played by someone in the crowds and was picked up by BFM TV's microphones during a bulletin, aired hours after the Christmas market terrorist had been shot dead in Strasbourg. It is believed an onlooker chose the song because its lyrics include the word 'sheriff' which sounds the same as the attacker's first name. Chekatt killed three and injured 13 during a gun rampage on Tuesday before being 'neutralised' by cops last night. Viewers could scarcely believe their ears. One wrote on Twitter: 'Am I the only one to have heard I Shot the Sheriff behind the footage of the killed terrorist on BFM TV?' Another added: 'Surreal! I shot the sheriff is playing in the background.' BFM has yet to comment. Jubilant crowds shouted 'bravo' and applauded French police last night after the gunman was killed in the street. Three policemen found Chekatt walking in the Neudorf area of central Strasbourg at 9pm. They tried to stop him but he opened fire and they shot him dead outside a warehouse. Crowds at the scene paid a touching tribute to officers who had hunted the terrorist for two days. More than 720 anti-terror cops had been looking for the 29-year-old since he walked through a Christmas market shooting and stabbing pedestrians before escaping wounded in a hijacked taxi. Chekatt then hid out in a warehouse a few hundred yards from his parents' house where he grew up in the northeastern French city. A woman spotted a man fitting his description with an injured arm on Thursday afternoon and alerted authorities. Police sealed off the area and used a helicopter with thermal cameras to hunt for the terrorist - but couldn't find him until the evening. Checkatt, 29, had criminal convictions in France and Germany and was radicalised in jail. After his death, ISIS propaganda news agency Amaq claimed he was a 'soldier' of Daesh. Police found weapons and jihadist propaganda in his flat and on Wednesday arrested his parents, two brothers and a friend in connection with the attack. On Friday, they arrested his third brother in Algeria to see if he was involved. Police thanked people who spotted him for helping track him down tweeting: 'Thank you for your reports that helped to find the wanted individual.' Police officer Emmanuel Georg told BFM TV station that three police officers patrolling the neighbourhood tried to intercept a suspect corresponding to Chekatt's description as he was about to enter a building. The officer said: 'He opened fired, they responded and managed to shoot him down.' A witness said he heard shots and rushed to the window to see what was happening and closed the shutters when he spotted the cornered suspect across the street. Cem Akcakaya said: 'I was very afraid for my children, I told them to go away, and I went to the side.' The propaganda wing of the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack, calling Chekatt one of its 'soldiers' who responded to its calls to target citizens of nations in the coalition fighting the jihadists in Iraq and Syria. Among the 13 injured in the attack, three remain in critical condition while three others have been released from hospital, Castaner said Thursday. Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries told reporters after news that Chekatt had been killed: 'I think it will help to get back to a life that I would describe as normal. With the death of this terrorist... citizens, like me, are relieved.' Neighbours on the housing estate where Chekatt family's lived described the suspect as a typical young man who dressed in jogging pants and trainers rather than traditional Islamic robes. A leader of a community group said outside Chekkat's apartment building in Strasbourg: 'He was a little gangster, but I didn't see any signs of him being radicalised.' The Paris prosecutor's office said Chekatt's parents and two brothers were being held in custody, while two of his sisters in Paris were also questioned today and one of their homes was being searched. French President Emmanuel Macron expressed 'the solidarity of the whole country' towards the victims as he arrived for a European summit in Brussels last night. 'It is not only France that has been hit... but a great European city as well,' he added, referring to the seat of the European parliament in the eastern French city that lies on the border with Germany. A relieved Strasbourg prepared to reopen its popular Christmas market on Friday after French police shot dead the gunman who killed three people there in an attack claimed by the Islamic State group. Cherif Chekatt was killed late Thursday after a two-day manhunt when a police patrol spotted him on a street in the district where he was last seen after Tuesday night's attack on Christmas shoppers. The lights on the market's towering Christmas tree were illuminated Friday for the first time since the attack ahead of the official re-opening of the market at 11am. 'I hope life will get back to normal but I'm not too sure,' said Franck Hoffmann as opened his wooden chalet offering Christmas candles and ornaments on Friday. 'Business isn't going to be what it was,' he predicted. Questions remained over how Chekatt was able to evade the tight security perimeter set up for an event long known to be a prime target for jihadist groups. Around 500 police, security agents and soldiers control access at checkpoints on the bridges leading to the river island, a UN World Heritage site, that houses the market. The goal is to 'create a bubble with searches at the entry points,' Mayor Roland Ries said after the attack, while regional government representative Jean-Luc Marx said he had not determined 'any flaws in the security measures'. Many residents, however, were not convinced after Chekatt managed to slip through the controls with a handgun and a knife. 'It doesn't surprise me,' said Emeline, 38, who works in the city centre. 'You wear a heavy coat, put something in the bottom of your bag. You can bring in what you want.' France's anti-terror prosecutor Remy Heitz is to hold a press conference in Strasbourg on Friday while Interior Minister Christophe Castaner will attend the reopening of the market, which usually draws two million people every year. France has been on high alert since the start of a wave of jihadist attacks in 2015, which prompted a threefold surge in the security budget for the market, to one million euros. Chekatt, a 29-year-old career criminal who lived in a rundown apartment block a short drive from the city centre, was flagged by French security forces in 2015 as a possible Islamic extremist. Strasbourg's deputy mayor Alain Fontanel admitted that despite patrols, plainclothes police, profilers and video surveillance, 'the risks can be reduced, but not eliminated'. 'We can't pat down and search everyone, only carry out random checks,' he said, adding that huge lines at checkpoints would only create a new potential target for terrorists. 'Someone who wants to get in an area this big with a weapon can do it,' he said. Such reasoning was little comfort to the residents and tourists who flock to the Strasbourg market. 'We thought this would happen only in Nice or at the Bataclan, but here it is at home,' said Sylvain, who works at another market in the city centre. He was referring to the truck attack which killed scores at Bastille Day festivities in Nice, southern France, in 2016, and the massacre at the capital's Bataclan concert hall in November 2015. 'I'm not going to forget this anytime soon. It's too painful. I'm not even sure I'm able to cry,' he said. Residents of Strasbourg's Neudorf neighborhood expressed relief, such as Pierre Plasse, who said: 'Everybody's quite happy that the killer has been finally shot. I think now, the city and life can keep going on in Strasbourg.'"
Suspects in Morocco murder of Scandavian tourists made video pledging allegiance to Islamic State,"Four suspects arrested over the killings of two Scandinavian university students in Morocco's Atlas Mountains made a video pledging allegiance to the Islamic State group, authorities in the country said on Thursday. Morocco's general prosecutor confirmed the authenticity of a video circulating on social media in which the four threatened to carry out attacks for Isil and its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Investigations showed that the video was made last week before the killing of the two women, Danish and Norwegian tourists who were trekking in the Atlas Mountains. The Danish intelligence agency had earlier said the women's slayings ""may be related"" to the Islamic State group. Three of the suspects were arrested on Thursday as they tried to flee Marrakech on a bus, Moroccan national security spokesman Boubker Sabik said. Another suspect was arrested on Tuesday.  Authorities have said no one is being sought besides the four in custody. Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen confirmed the identities of the victims, 24-year-old Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, of Denmark, and Norwegian citizen Maren Ueland, 28. The University of South-Eastern Norway said both women were students at its campus in Boe, southern Norway. ""What should have been a holiday trip turned into a nightmare"" for the women, Mr Loekke Rasmussen told reporters in Denmark."
Islamic State links hinted as Morocco nabs three more suspects in Nordic hikers' slaying," Authorities arrested three more suspects Thursday in the deaths of two Scandinavian university students who were killed in Morocco’s Atlas Mountains, while the Danish intelligence agency said the women’s slayings “may be related” to the Islamic State group. The three suspects were arrested as they tried to flee Marrakech on a bus, Moroccan national security spokesman Boubker Sabik said. Authorities have said they consider the killings a terrorist act, and Sabik said officials are investigating if the three have extremist ties. Another suspect was arrested Tuesday. Moroccan prosecutors said he had affiliations to an extremist group, without naming it. No other suspects besides the four now held are being sought, Sabik said. Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen confirmed the identities of the victims, 24-year-old Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, of Denmark, and Norwegian citizen Maren Ueland, 28. The University of South-Eastern Norway said both women were students at its campus in Boe, southern Norway. “What should have been a holiday trip turned into a nightmare” for the women, Loekke Rasmussen told reporters in Denmark. The women’s bodies were found Monday in a remote region of the Atlas Mountains not far from a village that often is the starting point for treks to Mount Toubkal, North Africa’s highest peak. Moroccan media outlets reported that investigators have video surveillance footage showing three suspects putting up a tent near the victims’ tent and leaving the area after the slayings. Other tourists found the women with stab wounds in their necks and alerted police, according to national media in Morocco. The killings were “politically motivated and thus an act of terror,” Denmark’s Loekke Rasmussen said, without identifying the potential motives. “There are still dark forces that want to fight our values” and “we must not give in.” In neighboring Norway, Prime Minister Erna Solberg said terrorism “is not the only lead that is being investigated in Morocco,” but the case “emphasizes the importance of combating violent extremism.” “We trust that Moroccan authorities are doing their utmost to arrest those responsible for the murders,” she said at a news conference. Preliminary findings from the investigation “indicate, according to Moroccan authorities, that the killings may be related to the terrorist organization the Islamic State group,” Denmark’s domestic security agency said in a statement to The Associated Press. The slayings have shocked Morocco, a popular tourist destination where attacks on foreigners are extremely rare. In the capital of Rabat, government spokesman Mustapha El Khalfi said Morocco condemned “this terrorist, criminal act.” “It is an unacceptable act that does not fit with the values and traditions of Moroccan people nor the traditions of the area where the crime happened,” Khalfi said Thursday. It is a denounced, condemned act.” A national security official who asked not to be named because he wasn’t authorized to speak to the media identified the suspects to The Associated Press as Abdessamad Ejjoud, born in 1993; Younes Ouziad, born in 1991; and Rashid Aftati, born in 1986. They had knives and slingshots when they were arrested, the official said. Morocco is generally considered safe for tourists but has battled with Islamic extremism for years. More than a thousand Moroccans are believed to have joined the Islamic State group. An anti-terrorism rally is being planned for Saturday in Rabat."
ISIS Christmas warning urges followers to 'kill crusaders in their festivals',"ISIS have urged all Muslims to 'kill crusaders in their festivals' over the Christmas period. It comes as tourists in Barcelona were warned of potential Christmas Day terror attack by bus driver. Officers have been told the Casablanca-born terrorist may try to commit a spectacular massacre in the Catalan capital using a coach or similar type of vehicle. At a Christmas market in Strasbourg earlier this month gunman Cherif Chekatt killed five before fleeing the scene. He was shot and killed days later - but had recorded a video pledging himself to Islamic State. The terrorist group, still fighting coalition forces in Syria, wants Muslims to 'kill crusaders' over the festive period as they increasingly rely on lone wolf-style attacks. The revelation surfaced after the US state department tweeted: ""Spain. Exercise heightened caution around areas of vehicle movement including buses in the Las Ramblas area of Barcelona during Christmas and New Year. ""Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, and other public areas."" Donald Trump recently announced that he was withdrawing roughly 2,000 US troops from Syria saying that ISIS had been 'defeated'. The decision led to Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis quitting his key role and issuing a scathing rebuke in his resignation letter. Trump later partially walked back his earlier tweet and said that Turkey had the means to defeat the Islamic State. The US president has also lost envoy Brett McGurk. The US special presidential envoy for the global coalition to defeat the militant group, submitted his resignation effective December 31 to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday, a State Department official said. McGurk, who was slated to leave his post in February 2019, objected to Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, a person familiar with the matter said, and added that Mattis' departure had a ""significant impact"" on McGurk's resignation. Trump, for his part, tweeted late Saturday that McGurk had simply moved up the date of his resignation and added: ""Grandstander?"" ""The Fake News is making such a big deal about this nothing event!"" he said on Twitter. McGurk was appointed by Obama in 2015 and has been instrumental in shaping Washington's policy in northern Syria, particularly its backing of Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militia that have been fighting Islamic State with US support for three years. Trump's declaration of triumph has alarmed key NATO allies such as France and Germany, who said the change of course on Syria risks damaging the fight against Islamic State, which has now been squeezed to a sliver of Syrian territory."
Scandinavian student murders: nine more arrested in Morocco,"Nine more people have been arrested in Morocco over links to the four initial suspects in the murder of two Scandinavian university students in a remote corner of the Atlas mountains, authorities said. A total of 13 men have been detained after the murder of the female hikers from Denmark and Norway. Moroccan authorities are treating the killings as a terrorist act. The women’s bodies were found on Monday with stab wounds to their necks. Morocco’s central bureau of judicial investigations said the nine new suspects had been carrying arms and “suspicious materials” used in the manufacture of explosives at the time of their arrests. No further details were available. The remains of the Danish student Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, and 28-year-old Norwegian Maren Ueland were put on a plane that left Casablanca for Copenhagen on Friday. Both women had lived in southern Norway, where they attended university. Moroccan authorities said on Thursday the four initial suspects arrested after the murder had pledged allegiance to Islamic State. The bodies of the two women were found on Monday. The pair had pitched their tent in an isolated mountain area two hours’ walk from the tourist village of Imlil. One of them had been beheaded, according to a source close to the investigation. Imlil is a starting point for trekking and climbing tours of Mount Toubkal, which at 4,167 metres is the highest summit in north Africa. Detectives are investigating a link to Islamic extremism after a video emerged showing the suspects pledging allegiance to Isis, the Rabat prosecutor has said. Authorities are also working to determine the authenticity of a video posted on social media that allegedly shows the murder of one of the tourists, according to the prosecutor. “At this point, there is no tangible evidence that the video is not authentic,” Norway’s criminal investigations agency, Kripos, said on Friday. The first four suspects to be arrested were detained in Marrakesh, an hour away from the scene of the murders. Younes Ouaziad, 27, lived with his parents in the Al-Azzouzia neighbourhood. His family and neighbours said on Friday that they were in shock. “He was a boy without any history, private. There was nothing to suggest he could do something like that,” Abdelaati, 35, a vegetable seller in the neighbourhood, said. Authorities in Denmark and Norway have condemned the murders. The Danish prime minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, denounced what he called a “beastly crime”. Norway’s prime minister, Erna Solberg, spoke of a “brutal and meaningless attack on innocents”. A Moroccan government spokesman, Mustapha Khalfi, described the killings as a “terrorist act” while the prime minister, Saadeddine Othmani, said it was a “stab in the back of Morocco and Moroccans”. Tourism is a cornerstone of Morocco’s economy, accounting for 10% of national income. The country has been spared jihadist attacks since 2011, when a bomb attack on a cafe in Marrakesh’s Jamaa El Fna Square killed 17 people, most of them European tourists."
Netanyahu says Israel is Arabs’ ‘ally’ against Iran,"RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan 1 — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said yesterday that Arab countries viewed Israel as an “indispensable ally” fighting Iran and the Islamic State group. That evaluation, he told Brazil’s Globo TV during a visit to Rio, has caused “a revolution in relations with the Arab world.” The comments came as Israel has stepped up air strikes on Iranian positions in neighbouring Syria, and as Israel digested an abrupt decision by President Donald Trump to withdraw US troops from Syria. Netanyahu has repeatedly warned that Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons to destroy his country. Israel, he said, had shown itself to be active in battling “radical Islam, violent Islam — either the one led by radical Shiites led by Iran, or the one led by the radical Sunnis led by Daesh (IS) and Al-Qaeda.” “Unfortunately we have not made any advance with the Palestinians. Half of them are already under the gun of Iran and of radical Islam,” Netanyahu added. Asked if he could ever contemplate sitting down with an Iranian leader to talk peace, Netanyahu replied: “If Iran remains committed to our destruction the answer is no.” The only way, he said, would be “if Iran undergoes a total transformation.” Netanyahu was in Brazil to attend today’s inauguration of the Latin American country’s new, pro-Israel president, Jair Bolsonaro. On the sidelines of the ceremony, Netanyahu was to hold talks with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is also among the visiting dignitaries. They were expected to discuss the US troop pullout from Syria and Iranian activities in the Middle East. — AFP"
 IS-inspired group eyed in blast," COTABATO CITY—Military and police officials are looking at an Islamic State-inspired group as possibly behind the blast that killed two people and injured more than 30 others outside a shopping mall here on New Year’s Eve. Maj. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, commander of the Army’s 6th Infantry Division, said the attack was apparently a retaliation for his unit’s offensive against the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) and a group that had broken away from it, the Daulah Islamiyah. Both groups have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) jihadi group in Iraq and Syria. A homemade bomb packed with cut nails and ball bearings went off in front of the baggage counter at the entrance to South Seas Mall along Don Rufino Alonzo Avenue at 1:59 p.m. on Monday, killing the driver of a member of the Bangsamoro Transition Commission (BTC) and a woman who was about to enter the shopping mall. The fatalities were identified on Tuesday as Jonathan Tasic Torribiano, 39, driver of BTC Commissioner Melanio Ulama, and Miriam Wahab Kali, 31, of Barangay Poblacion 2, Cotabato City. Malacañang vowed that justice would be served. “We empathize with the families, relatives and friends of those who suffered from this unhappy occurrence. To them, we vow that we will get to the bottom of this at the soonest possible time,” presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo said in a statement. The bomb went off as people were doing last-minute shopping for the traditional New Year celebrations. Officials said on Tuesday that 34 other people were injured in the blast. Three of them were in critical condition, they said. Scattered debris, including items sold for New Year’s Eve revelry such as horns made of cardboard and plastic, gifts and a bloody slipper lay at the shopping mall’s entrance. Windows of surrounding buildings were shattered by the blast. Sobejana said a man was seen carrying a box that he left in front of the baggage counter of the shopping mall. It exploded a few seconds later. The explosion prompted police to search the shopping mall, leading to the discovery of another bomb, which they destroyed, said Chief Insp. Rowell Zafra, spokesperson for the local police. Sobejana said the bomb that went off had the signature of the Daulah Islamiyah. He said the military had some “leads” in the attack but did not elaborate. Abu Misry Mama, spokesperson for the BIFF and the Daulah Islamiyah, said on Tuesday that neither group had a hand in the blast. Senior Supt. Rolly Octavio, city police director, said investigators were reviewing images captured by security cameras at the shopping mall for leads. Octavio said a security camera captured the image of the man who left the second bomb at the shopping mall’s baggage counter. He said bomb experts recovered about a kilo of cut nails, a plastic container with traces of black powder, and cell-phone parts. Cotabato City Mayor Cynthia Guiani-Sayadi on Tuesday claimed the authorities had “information about the suspects,” but had yet to determine the motive for the attack. Sayadi said the city had been put on lockdown, with a “no ID, no entry” policy being enforced at checkpoints and all points of exit and entry into the city. Jerome Succor Aba, a spokesperson for Suara Bangsamoro, said the rush to accuse IS-inspired militants even before an investigation could be carried out would justify a military takeover of Cotabato City and other Muslim-majority areas in Mindanao as residents prepared for a plebiscite to ratify the proposed charter of a new Muslim autonomous region on the island. The plebiscite for the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), which would establish the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, is set for Jan. 21 and Feb. 6. Aba said a military takeover could limit the campaign for the plebiscite or even lead to the cancellation of the vote for security reasons. Lt. Gen. Benjamin Madrigal, chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, condemned the bombing and gave assurance of full military cooperation with the Philippine National Police in the investigation of the attack. Responding to criticism that the blast happened despite the extension of martial law in Mindanao for another year, Col. Noel Detoyato, chief of the AFP public affairs office, said, “It could have been worse without martial law.” President Duterte placed Mindanao under martial law in May 2017 to crush IS-inspired local terrorists who seized Marawi City in Lanao del Sur province. Congress has extended military rule on the island three times on the President’s request, the latest up to Dec. 31, 2019. Gov. Mujiv Hataman of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao called the perpetrators of the explosion “evil,” and urged residents of the region to pray for the people of Cotabato City. “Evil acts like this will be punished in this world and the next, while all good deeds will be rewarded,” Hataman said. Murad Ebrahim, chief of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which has signed a peace agreement with the government and is leading the campaign for the ratification of the proposed Bangsamoro charter, also condemned the attack, describing it as “an act of cowardice, inhuman and atrocious.” —WITH REPORTS FROM JEANNETTE I.

Police hunt across eastern France for Strasbourg Christmas market attacker Manila Bulletin News,"STRASBOURG, France (Reuters) – Police searched through eastern France on Wednesday for a man suspected of killing at least two people in a gun attack on a Christmas market in Strasbourg and who was known to have been religiously radicalized while in jail. Witnesses told investigators the assailant cried out “Allahu Akbar” (God is Greater) as he launched his attack on the market, the Paris prosecutor said. The prosecutor, Remy Heitz, also suggested the suspect may have chosen his target for its religious symbolism. “Considering the target, his way of operating, his profile and the testimonies of those who heard him yell ‘Allahu Akbar’, the anti-terrorist police has been called into action,” Heitz told a news conference. Police issued a wanted poster for the suspect identifying him as Strasbourg-born Cherif Chekatt, 29, who is on an intelligence services watch list as a potential security risk. An investigation had been opened into alleged murder with terrorist intent and suspected ties to terrorist networks with intent to commit crimes, Heitz said. Two people were killed and a third person was brain-dead and being kept alive on life support, he said. Six other victims were fighting for their lives. France raised its security threat to the highest alert level, strengthening controls on its border with Germany as elite commandos backed by helicopters hunted for the suspect. French and German agents checked vehicles and public transport crossing the Rhine river, along which the Franco-German frontier runs, backing up traffic in both directions. Hundreds of French troops and police were taking part in the manhunt. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said an additional 1,800 soldiers would be put on anti-terror security patrols with a special focus on Christmas markets. Sylvaine Jardin, director of the Porcus charcuterie, just metres from where the shooting took place struggled to hold back tears saying she needed to work so as not to think about what had happened. “We can’t let ourselves be submerged by fear, but we’ll feel better when he is caught,” she said, adding that traders had last year been given training and advice in preparation for a possible attack. SERIAL CONVICT The gunman struck at about 1900 GMT on Tuesday, just as the picturesque Christmas market in the historic city was shutting down. He engaged in two gunfights with security forces as he evaded a police dragnet and bragged about his acts to the driver of a taxi that he commandeered, prosecutor Heitz said. No one has yet claimed responsibility, but the U.S.-based Site intelligence group, which monitors jihadist websites, said Islamic State supporters were celebrating. French and German security officials painted a portrait of Chekatt as a serial law-breaker who had racked up more than two dozen convictions in France, Germany and Switzerland, and served time in prison. “It was during these spells in jail that we detected a radicalization in his religious practices. But we there were never signs he was preparing an attack,” Deputy Interior Minister Laurent Nunez said. One German security source said the suspect was jailed in southern Germany from August 2016 to February 2017 for aggravated theft but was released before the end of his 27-month sentence so that he could be deported to France. “He was banned from re-entering Germany at the same time”, the security source in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg said. “We don’t have any knowledge of any kind of radicalization.” BORDER CONTROLS The attack took place at a testing time for President Emmanuel Macron, who is struggling to quell a month-long public revolt over high living costs that has spurred the worst public unrest in central Paris since the 1968 student riots. The disclosure that Chekatt was on a security watchlist will raise questions over possible intelligence failures, though some 26,000 individuals suspected of posing a security risk to France are on the “S File” list. Of these, about 10,000 are believed to have been radicalized, sometimes in fundamentalist Salafist Muslim mosques, in jail or abroad. Police had raided the suspect’s home early on Tuesday in connection with a homicide investigation. Five people were detained and under interrogation as part of that investigation. At the Europa Bridge, the main border crossing in the region used by commuters traveling in both directions, armed police inspected vehicles. Police were also checking pedestrians and trains arriving in Germany from Strasbourg. Secular France has for years grappled with how to respond to both homegrown jihadists and foreign militants following attacks in Paris, Nice, Marseille and beyond. In 2016, a truck plowed into a Bastille Day crowd in Nice, killing more than 80 people. In November 2015, coordinated Islamist militant attacks on the Bataclan concert hall and other sites in Paris claimed about 130 lives. There have also been attacks in Paris on police on the Champs-Elysees avenue, the offices of satirical weekly publication Charlie Hebdo and a kosher store. A man drove a trunk into a crowd at a Christmas market in Berlin in December 2016, killing 12 people."
Rubble and charred cars in former Syria jihadist hub,"HAJIN (Syria), Dec 17 — Burnt-out cars, craters and collapsed buildings dot the side of a road in the Syrian village of Hajin, after US-backed forces expelled the Islamic State group. The sound of mortar fire and flying bullets resounded inside Hajin on Saturday, as huge clouds of grey smoke billowed over the outskirts of the large village in eastern Syria. The yellow flag of the Syrian Democratic Forces flew above one building, after the Kurdish-led fighters seized the village from IS jihadists on Friday. “Hajin has come under the control of our forces,” SDF commander Zanar Awaz said. “We are now fighting on the outskirts of Hajin and we are preparing to enter nearby villages,” he said in Kurdish, a shot of white in his short black hair. “We will finish off this terrorist group.” Hajin lies on the east bank of the Euphrates in the eastern province of Deir Ezzor, about 30 kilometres from the border with Iraq. The village’s capture marks a milestone in a massive and costly operation backed by a US-led coalition to expel IS from eastern Syria. On Saturday, armoured vehicles brought in SDF fighters to reinforce the front lines outside Hajin, as coalition planes and helicopters flew overhead. An SDF fighter sitting on the top of a vehicle with fellow combatants flashed a victory sign. The Kurdish-led SDF launched an offensive in September to expel IS from a pocket including its main village Hajin, but their advance has been fraught with obstacles. “We’ve been facing a lot of difficulties: IS car bombs, suicide attackers. Most of them are foreign,” Awaz said. On Saturday morning, IS launched a counterattack, but the SDF said it succeeded in repelling them with the backing of coalition air strikes. Since the start of the operation on September 10, at least 930 jihadists and more than 540 SDF fighters have been killed, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said. In addition, more than 320 civilians have lost their lives, many in coalition air strikes, according to the Observatory. The coalition has however repeatedly denied targeting civilians. But no civilians were visible in Hajin on Saturday, after thousands fled the village and nearby areas. A convoy of armoured cars ferried in US soldiers, churning up dust along the way. On a hill that used to act as the village cemetery, tunnels and trenches dug by the jihadists lay covered in sheets and colourful blankets. SDF fighter Bahouz, who did not give his last name, remembered first entering the district’s hospital. He said he took pictures of the dead jihadists he saw there. “They think they’ll go to paradise, but we killed them,” he said, carrying a gun and hand grenades around his waist. “Death is their destiny as they destroyed everything.” IS swept across large swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq in 2014, implementing their brutal interpretation of Islamic law in areas they controlled. But they have since seen their dream of a state crumble, as they have lost most of that territory to various offensives. In Syria, IS fighters are holding out in what remains of the pocket that once included Hajin, including the villages of Al-Shaafa and Sousa. They have also retained a presence in the vast Badia desert, but that front is managed by Russia-backed regime forces. According to the Observatory, a total of 17,000 SDF fighters are involved in the fight to seize the eastern pocket, compared to around 2,000 jihadists. Inside Hajin village, SDF fighter Mohammed al-Mohammed said his spirits were high. “There’s only a bit left” to capture from IS, said the 19-year-old. “We will head on to Al-Shaafa and Sousa to liberate them and win, God willing.” — AFP"
Macron visits Strasbourg as police probe potential accomplices,"STRASBOURG, Dec 15 — French President Emmanuel Macron visited Strasbourg yesterday, a day after police shot dead a gunman who killed four people at the city’s Christmas market, as investigators probe whether the jihadist had any accomplices. Macron placed a white rose on the Kleber monument, which has become a makeshift memorial in the centre of the city with thousands of candles, flowers and messages, as soldiers sang the Marseillaise national anthem. “The whole nation stands with the people of Strasbourg. This is what I wanted to tell them tonight,” said Macron, who had earlier taken part in a European Union summit in Brussels. Annette, 80, one of the hundreds attending the Strasbourg memorial, said she “came to pray for those who are no longer here”. The eastern French city near the German border slowly began to return to normality yesterday, with its famous Christmas market reopening after 29-year-old Cherif Chekatt, a small-time criminal turned jihadist, went on a shooting spree there on Tuesday evening. He shot dead a Thai tourist, on holiday in Strasbourg with his wife, an Afghan who sought refuge in France some 20 years ago, a 28-year-old Italian journalist in town to cover the European parliament, and a local Frenchman who had just retired. Twelve people were also wounded in his attack, including one who has been declared brain-dead. The Islamic State group’s propaganda arm said in a Twitter post that Chekatt was one of its “soldiers”, a claim which was dismissed yesterday by France’s Interior Minister Christophe Castaner as “completely opportunistic”. France’s anti-terror prosecutor Remy Heitz said the investigation was now focusing on whether anyone “helped or encouraged Chekatt preparing or carrying out” the attack — or assisted him while he was on the run. Seven people were in police custody yesterday, including Chekatt’s parents and two brothers, Heitz said. Another brother, who like Chekatt was on France’s anti-terror watchlist for suspected extremists, has been detained in Algeria, sources close to the inquiry told AFP. Officials praised the massive public help and quick police reaction that led to the death of Chekatt, a career criminal with 27 convictions in four countries, late on Thursday. He was tracked down at around 9:00 pm (2000 GMT) when a police patrol spotted him on a street in the Neudorf district where he was last seen after his gun and knife attack on Tuesday night. Around 800 people called in tips to a hotline after the authorities released his name and photo Wednesday night. Two calls in particular were “decisive” in finding Chekatt, Heitz said. The information allowed police to cordon off an area while a helicopter equipped with a heat-seeking camera flew over the gardens. Spotted by a police patrol, Chekatt tried to escape by entering a building. Unable to get in the door, he turned and shot at the three officers with a handgun as they tried to approach. Two police officers returned fire and killed him, Heitz told a press conference in Strasbourg. Questions remain over how Chekatt was able to evade the tight security perimetre set up around the Christmas market, a prime target for jihadist groups. Around 500 police, security agents and soldiers control access at checkpoints on the bridges leading to the river island, a UN World Heritage site, that houses the market. The goal is to “create a bubble with searches at the entry points,” Mayor Roland Ries said after the attack, while regional government representative Jean-Luc Marx said he had not determined “any flaws in the security measures”. France has been on high alert since the start of a wave of jihadist attacks in 2015, which prompted a threefold surge in the security budget for the market, to one million euros. Chekatt, a Strasbourg native who lived in a rundown apartment block a short drive from the city centre, was flagged by French security forces in 2015 as a possible Islamic extremist. But Defence Minister Florence Parly rejected criticism that Chekatt’s presence on the extremist watchlist should have prompted a more proactive reaction from the authorities. “You can’t... arrest someone just because you think he might do something,” Parly told Radio Classique yesterday. Strasbourg’s deputy mayor Alain Fontanel admitted that despite patrols, plainclothes police, profilers and video surveillance, “the risks can be reduced, but not eliminated”. “We can’t pat down and search everyone, only carry out random checks,” he said, adding that huge lines at checkpoints would only create a new potential target for terrorists. “Someone who wants to get in an area this big with a weapon can do it,” he said. — AFP"
"Most Islamic State commanders in Mosul already killed, Iraqi general says","A civilian walks next to a vehicle of the Iraqi Special Operations Forces (ISOF) as he leaves the city to escape from clashes during a battle with Islamic State militants, in al-Zirai district in Mosul, Iraq, January 19, 2017. — Reuters pic MOSUL, Jan 19 —Most Islamic State (IS) commanders in Mosul have been killed in battles with Iraqi government forces that raged over the past three months in the eastern side of the city, an Iraqi general said today. The fight to take the western side of Mosul, which remains under the jihadists’ control, should not be more difficult than the one on the eastern side, Lieutenant-General Abdul Ghani al-Assadi told Reuters before embarking on a tour of areas newly retaken. Assadi’s Counter-Terrorism Service announced yesterday that almost all of the city’s eastern half had been brought under government control. “God willing, there will be a meeting in the next few days attended by all the commanders concerned with liberation operations,” he said, replying to a question on when he expects a thrust into the western side of Mosul to begin. “It will not be harder than what we have seen. The majority of (IS) commanders have been killed in the eastern side.” He did not give further details. Since late 2015, government forces backed by US-led coalition air power have wrested back large amounts of northern and western territory overrun by IS in a shock 2014 offensive. On Thursday, regular Iraqi army troops captured the Nineveh Oberoy hotel, the so-called “palaces” area on the eastern bank of the Tigris, and Tel Kef, a small town just to the north according to military statements in Baghdad. The army is still battling militants in al-Arabi, the last district which remains under their control east of the river, said one of the statements. Over 50 watercraft and barges used by Islamic State to supply their units east of the river were destroyed in air strikes, the US envoy to the coalition, Brett McGurty, tweeted. Mogul’s five bridges across the Tigris had already been partially damaged by US-led air strikes to slow the militants’ movement, before Islamic State blew up two of them. “God willing, there will be an announcement in the next few days that all the eastern bank is under control,” Assai said. A Reuters correspondent saw army troops deploying in an area by the river as mortar and gun fire rang out further north. On one of the streets newly recaptured from Islamic State, men were reassembling breeze blocks into a wall that was blown up by a suicide car bomb several days ago. Prime Minister Hailer al-Badri said late on Tuesday that Islamic State had been severely weakened in the Mosul campaign, and the military had begun moving against it in the western half. He did not elaborate. If the US-backed campaign is successful it will likely spell the end of the Iraqi part of the self-styled caliphate declared by the ultra-hardline Islamic State in 2014, which extends well into neighbouring Syria. Several thousand civilians have been killed or wounded in the Mosul fighting since October. — Reuters"
Islamic State cells in nearly all Indonesian provinces — military chief,"The Islamic State militant group has a presence in nearly all provinces across Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority country, the military chief in Jakarta has said. General Gatot Nurmantyo’s comments late on Monday that there are clandestine “sleeper” cells across the sprawling Indonesian archipelago underscored concerns about Islamic State’s growing influence in Southeast Asia. “After observation, we see that in almost every province … there are already IS cells, but they are sleeper cells,” Nurmantyo told reporters in the capital, Jakarta. He singled out the predominantly Christian province of Papua as one of the few exceptions. “These sleeper cells can easily join up with other radical cells,” he said. Governments across the region have been on high alert since Islamic State-linked militants, mostly from Southeast Asian countries, overran a city in the southern Philippines about three weeks ago. The Philippine military, which has carried out air strikes and raids in Marawi city, said on Tuesday the militants still control about 20 percent of the city. Indonesian and Malaysian officials have stepped up security to prevent militants from escaping from Marawi over their shared borders with the Philippines. “It’s easy to jump from Marawi to Indonesia and we must all beware of sleeper cells being activated in Indonesia,” Nurmantyo said. Southeast Asian nations believe the region is home to thousands of Islamic State sympathizers, and Indonesia and Malaysia have detained scores of suspected militants in recent years. Singapore said on Monday it had detained an assistant child-care worker suspected of trying to join Islamic State, the first woman to be held on such charges in Singapore. A gun-and-bomb attack that killed four people in Jakarta last year marked the first Islamic State strike in the region. There has since been a string of small, Islamic State-inspired attacks in Indonesia, the latest of which were twin suicide bombings at a Jakarta bus station that killed three police officers last month.

Sona 2 blasts ‘state enemies’,"PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte took aim at communist rebels and Islamic State extremists in his second State of the Nation Address Monday, saying the enemies of the state deserve to be “bullied” with the full might of the government. “Times have changed because God placed me here. They call me a bully. You sons of whores, I’m really a bully, especially to the enemies of the state,” the President said in Filipino, in an expletive-laced speech that ran for more than two hours. Duterte recently called off peace talks with the communist rebels, after New People’s Army rebels ambushed a military convoy that included his security group. The President went off script and peppered his speech with expletives as he took potshots at the communist movement and his former professor, Jose Maria Sison, the founding chairman of the Communist Party of the Philippines, who is in self-exile in the Netherlands. He also said the peace talks were becoming expensive for Norway, which has agreed to broker the negotiations. “It’s expensive because those crazies keep going back and forth like tourists,” he said, referring to the communist negotiators. “They don’t say anything, then when they come here, they say they want this, and want that. Lulu mo,” he said, using a Visayan phrase that means to go masturbate. He also slammed the communist New People’s Army for attcking members of his security detail in Arakan, North Cotabato. “Even my policemen, you ambush them every day. And you even want to kill me, because that was my convoy you fired on with a machine gun,” he said, while acknowledging that he was far away from the scene of the ambush. In an unprecedented move, Duterte confronted leftist protesters near the Batasang Pambansa after his Sona, and said they could talk peace only if both sides respected the other. He also dared anyone with a gun to shoot him there and then. “Respect? You’d ambush me. We should all suffer. Who has a gun? Fire away. Go ahead, I’ll catch it and send it back to you crazies,” he said in Filipino. Toward the end of his speech to the protesters, he asked for more time for his administration to continue with the reforms, noting that he had accepted leftists into his Cabinet.  Then he cursed again at the NPA ambush of his convoy. “You want to kill even me. If I die, who will you talk peace with? My spirit?” he said in Filipino. Over the weekend, Duterte said he will no longer talk peace with the communists and ordered the military to train its guns on the New People’s Army after it has retaken Marawi City from Islamist terrorists. Duterte also said that the NDF was no longer interested in pursuing talks amid its continued criticism of some of his policies and the NPA’s relentless attacks on state troops. He ordered the arrest of all NDF consultants who were given temporary freedom to hold talks with the government.The Office of the Solicitor General earlier asked the Supreme Court and several regional trial courts handling the cases against the communist leaders to recall the bail given them, after backchannel talks were called off Wednesday amid the renewed attacks by communist rebels, including one against members of Duterte’s security detail. Duterte also accused communists of abuses when a leftist group occupied housing units intended for soldiers. “The left is too much. You build a house and they will steal it,” he said in Filipino. “And you try to intimidate me by saying you will occupy the streets? I’ll give you six months there. Don’t you leave,” he said. Duterte was referring to an urban poor group, Kadamay, that had forcibly occupied thousands of housing units that were intended for soldiers and policemen. In the same speech, Duterte reiterated that the government is determined to finish off jihadist forces lurking in Mindanao, where martial law has been extended to the end of the year. “I declared martial law in Mindanao because I believed that that was the fastest way to quell the rebellion at the least cost of lives and properties,” Duterte said. “At the same time, the government would be adequately equipped with the constitutional tool not only to prevent the escape of rebels who can easily mingle and pretend to be civilian evacuees only to re-group in another place to fight another day, but also to prevent them from spreading their gospel of hate and violence in the rest of Mindanao.” “To decisively address insurgency and terrorism, we are working doubly hard towards [achieving] a stronger and more credible national defense system for the country. We continue to strengthen the defense capability of the AFP as a deterrence against terrorists, lawless elements, and other threats,” he added.  He also reiterated his support for and commitment to the military and for those who are on the ground.  “The people of Marawi need help. Caught in the crossfire between government troops and Muslim extremists, they have been through hell and we need to help them rise and move forward,” he said.  “If we cannot provide for the poor and the needy who are many, then we will not be able to keep from harm the rich who are few,” he added.  At a press conference after his SONA, Duterte rejected the possibility of putting the entire nation under martial law, saying this would make him look stupid. Duterte also acknowledged there was a failure of intelligence in Marawi City, which was overrun by Islamic State-inspired terrorists. “There was a failure of intelligence. There were tunnels. Maute was stocking explosives. There was a mistake in the evaluation or assessment,” Duterte said."
Islamic State group claims Las Vegas attack,"BEIRUT, Lebanon—The Islamic State group claimed Monday that the shooting massacre in Las Vegas was carried out by one of its “soldiers” who had “converted to Islam” months ago. “The executor of the Las Vegas attack is a soldier of the Islamic State and he carried out the operation as a response” to calls to target countries fighting the jihadists, Islamic State’s propaganda outlet Amaq said on the Telegram online messaging service. It dubbed 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, who shot dead at least 58 people from a high-rise hotel window on the Las Vegas Strip, a “soldier of the caliphate” with the nom de guerre Abu Abdel Bar al-Amriki. READ: Sniper in high-rise hotel kills at least 58, injures 515 in Las Vegas “The author of the Las Vegas attack converted to Islam a few months ago,” Amaq said in a series of messages. “From a hotel overlooking a music concert, [Paddock] opened fire on one of the groups, leaving 600 dead or injured, until using up his ammunition and becoming a martyr.” The group provided no evidence to back up its claims, and US security officials remained cautious amid no other signs to connect Paddock to the jihadists. Early in their investigation police said they had no information to link him with international terror groups. In response to a query, Central Intelligence Agency spokesman Jonathan Liu said they were aware of the Islamic state claim. “We advise caution on jumping to conclusions before the facts are in,” Liu said. Islamic State has moved quickly to claim credit for a number of recent attacks around the world, suggesting the “soldiers” were acting under their inspiration. However, said Lorenzo Vidino, director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, they have also made a number of false claims, including that they were behind a robbery in a Manila casino in June, and what turned out to be a neo-Nazi attack on a Russian FSB intelligence service office in Khabarovsk in April. “Especially recently, they have claimed responsibility for very random stuff that they had nothing to do with,” Vidino said. “For a long time they have embellished real events. They twist the foundation of truth.” Such claims have gained pace as Islamic State finds its hold on its “caliphate” territory in Iraq and Syria greatly shrunk in the face of US-guided coalition assaults. Almost fully expelled from their one-time bastion in Raqa, Syria, coalition leaders say they are preparing for a final siege against the remnants of the jihadist army in the Middle Euphrates River Valley spanning Syria and Iraq. On Friday Islamic State released an audio recording of what it said was its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi calling on jihadists in Syria and Iraq to “resist” their enemies. That was seen as a move to boost the morale of its fighters in Syria and Iraq. Even if the group is defeated in its base area, anti-terror experts say they do not expect that will end its global reach. Despite their battlefield losses, “the ISIS ability to reach globally is still largely intact,” Nick Rasmussen, director of the US National Counterterrorism Center, said last week. On Sunday the group claimed responsibility for an attack in Marseille, France where a young man stabbed two women to death before he was shot by security officials. But by Monday afternoon it had not claimed the attack in Edmonton, Canada, in which a Somali refugee attacked a policeman on Saturday with a knife and then hit four people with a truck."
"ISIS fighter with American accent urges supporters to take advantage of US gun laws, United States News & Top Stories","WASHINGTON (WASHINGTON POST) - In a video released on Wednesday (Dec 27) by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) militant group, a one-legged fighter identified by the group as an American called on Muslims in the United States to ""take advantage"" of the country's gun laws to obtain weapons and carry out attacks. The fighter, identified as ""Abu Salih al-Amriki,"" wears khaki fatigues with a holstered pistol in the online video, which was published by a propaganda wing of ISIS. He speaks in English with what sounded like a New York City-area accent. ""Take advantage of the fact that you can easily obtain a rifle or a pistol in America,"" the fighter implored. ""Spray the kuffar (infidels) with bullets so that their fear of the Muslims rises and they continue to reveal their hatred towards Islam."" The Site Intelligence Group, a private organisation that tracks Islamist militant media, published a copy of the video in which Abu Salih also called President Donald Trump a ""dog of Rome"". ""You entered into the White House on the back of your crusader rhetoric which the fake media has pressured you to tone down,"" the fighter said. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security had no immediate comment on Abu Salih's identity nor the potential threat of his entreaties to violence. But the possibility that ISIS followers in the United States will acquire powerful weapons by legal means has been a growing concern of American counterterrorism officials. Just last week, the outgoing director of the National Counterterrorism Centre, Nicholas Rasmussen, told reporters that permissive US gun laws enable mass murders who want to carry out large-scale attacks. ""We find ourselves in a more dangerous situation because our population of violent extremists has no difficulty gaining access to weapons that are quite lethal,"" Rasmussen said. ""I wish that weren't so."" The video released on Wednesday begins with Abu Salih slipping on what looks like a prosthetic leg and pushing himself up on crutches. A bullet-scarred cityscape of demolished buildings appears in the background as he launches into his statement, which also urges other wounded and disabled militants to keep fighting. It was not immediately clear where or when Abu Salih's statement was recorded. The slickly produced video is part of a recent series the militant group has dubbed Inside The Caliphate that has featured mainly foreign militants threatening attacks. A montage of beheadings and bombings follows Abu Salih's statement, set to a soundtrack of militants chanting. The recent videos were produced by the ISIS' al-Hayat Media Centre, which has published some of the group's most high-profile material targeting Western audiences. Its online magazine Rumiyah is published in several languages, including English, and often features calls for attacks in the West. The group has urged followers to kill with any tools at their disposal, including vehicles, and the group claimed responsibility for the Oct 31 truck attack that killed eight people along a bike path in Lower Manhattan. In Wednesday's video Abu Salih also tells attackers to ""get a knife and slice the throat of the (infidels) so that they know that the blood of the Muslims is not cheap."" The group's media output has waned, however, as it loses prime territory in Iraq and Syria, where it once declared an Islamic caliphate. Before Wednesday's release, the most recent of the Inside The Caliphate series urged ISIS followers to be patient following the ""blood spilled"" in Syria and Iraq. It also encouraged supporters everywhere to ""rise against the (infidels)."""
NTT policeman turns gun on himself in apparent suicide attempt,"Adj. First Insp. Fransisco De Araujo, the head of the Vital Installation Security Unit for the Kupang Kota Police in East Nusa Tenggara (NTT), was found in critical condition in his house in Oebobo district, Kupang, on Tuesday morning after he apparently shot himself in the head. “We are still investigating the reason why he shot himself,” NTT Police spokesman Adj. Sr. Comr. Jules Abast told The Jakarta Post. A witness, Saladin, heard a gunshot at about 7.30 a.m. “Along with the victim’s neighbors, they forcefully opened his room’s door, which was locked from inside,” Jules said. Fransisco was found lying on a bed with a bullet wound to the head. “We have seized the pistol, which was found on the floor,” the spokesman added. The man has been treated at the Bhayangkara Hospital, Kupang. A criminal expert from Nusa Cendana University, Dedy Manafe, said the police needed to conduct annual psychological tests on every officer who carried firearms. “Many police officers suffered from psychological disorder because of pressure, such as financial problems or receiving punishment from superiors. If an officer is found to be not mentally fit, his or her firearm must be withdrawn,” he said. (bbs)"
Terror fears prompt first Australia gun amnesty in 20 years,"The government believes there are as many as 260,00 illicit weapons on the streets, and with the threat of extremist attacks and a spate of gangland shootings, it wants to minimise the danger. ""We are living in a time when our national security environment has deteriorated. Unfortunately, we have seen, through terror attacks in Australia, that illegal guns have been used,"" said Justice Minister Michael Keenan ""We believe... now is the time to run another amnesty, with the aim of reducing this pool of illegal guns."" Australian officials have grown increasingly concerned over the threat of extremist attacks and have prevented 12 on home soil since September 2014. But five have taken place, mostly with guns, including a fatal shootout in Melbourne this month claimed by the Islamic State group. The amnesty will run from July 1 until September 30, allowing people to hand in unregistered or unwanted firearms with no questions asked. Outside that period people face fines of up to Aus$280,000 (US$212,000) or 14 years jail. While individual states periodically run amnesties, this is the first national one since 35 people died at the historic Tasmanian colonial convict site of Port Arthur in 1996. The massacre, when lone gunman Martin Bryant went on the rampage armed with semi-automatic weapons, shocked Australia and then-prime minister John Howard enacted tougher gun laws, including bans on certain weapons, a minimum ownership age, and licences. Gun control measures continue to have strong public support in Australia. More than 600,000 weapons were destroyed in the aftermath of the Port Arthur attack, during a gun buy-back in which compensation was offered. No money is on offer this time and Keenan admitted many hardened criminals were unlikely to hand in their weapons. But he voiced hope some would heed the call. ""When we have had state-based amnesties, we have seen guns handed in in the thousands and my expectation is this will get a similar sort of number,"" he said. All guns in Australia must be registered but many arrive illegally from overseas through organised syndicates. Canberra set up a new border protection agency merging operations from the customs and immigration departments in 2014, partly to better screen what was coming in. Keenan said millions of dollars had since been spent since on better tools to detect illegal firearms in the mail or cargo, while a police anti-gang squad had seized 5,500 illicit guns or gun parts since being established in 2013."
Vietnamese hostage killed in Philippine clash,"July 16, 2017 MANILA (AFP) – A Vietnamese sailor being held hostage by extremist gunmen in southern Philippines was killed during a gun battle between the militants and troops, a military official said Thursday. Van Viet Tran was found dead yesterday following the clash with members of the feared Abu Sayyaf kidnapping group in the strife-torn Sulu island group, Brigadier General Cirilito Sobejana said. A soldier was also killed with 15 other troops wounded while the Abu Sayyaf suffered undetermined casualties, said Sobejana who heads a special anti-terror task force. “He (the Vietnamese) was hit by a bullet. Two things may have happened: he was hit during the encounter or he may have tried to take advantage of the situation (to escape) and then his abductors shot him,” he said. He said militants were holding Van and four other Vietnamese apparently kidnapped at sea in Sulu. Six other Vietnamese seamen were also being held on Basilan Island near Sulu, but two of them were beheaded last week. Abu Sayyaf militants have been seizing hostages for ransom for years, often targeting foreigners such as seamen passing through the waters of southern Philippines. The group, blamed for the worst terror attacks in the country’s history, is known to behead its hostages unless ransom payments are made. German Jurgen Kantner, 70, was beheaded in February after the kidnappers’ demand for 30 million pesos ($600,000) was not met. Last year, the Abu Sayyaf group also beheaded two Canadian hostages. Originally a loose network of militants formed in the 1990s with seed money from Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda network, the Abu Sayyaf group has splintered into factions with some continuing to engage in banditry and kidnapping. One faction led by Isnilon Hapilon has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, and its members are among the hundreds of militants who have been occupying parts of the southern city of Marawi for almost two months, despite a massive military operation to crush them."
Fil-Am in North Carolina gets life term for plotting mayhem with ISIS,"ASHEVILLE, North Carolina — A North Carolina man accused of plotting a U.S. terror attack that he discussed with a member of the Islamic State group received a life sentence on Tuesday, June 27. Justin Sullivan, 21, (a Filipino American) pleaded guilty in November. The Morganton man is also accused of killing his neighbor and stealing his money so he could buy an assault rifle to carry out an IS-inspired shooting at a concert or club. A doctor will observe Sullivan to determine if he’s predisposed to schizophrenia. The defense argued that being placed in a high-security prison could trigger schizophrenia. Prosecutors asked for a determination on the Clarke murder, but the judge only ruled on the acts of terror. The judge said he didn’t need to make a decision on the homicide case because that is the state’s responsibility. Prosecutors say Sullivan spoke with Junaid Hussain in June 2015 via social media about making a video of a terrorist attack in the U.S. to be used by the militant group. Hussain was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Syria in August 2015. Prosecutors said in a statement that Sullivan pleaded guilty to attempting to commit an act of terrorism – planning to kill hundreds of innocent people to prove his allegiance to the terrorist group ISIL. Prosecutors say Sullivan also admitted to regular contact with Junaid Hussain, one of ISIL’s prominent members in Syria, who asked Sullivan to make a video of the deadly attack. “It is frightening to know that the defendant in this case was able to use social media to contact and seek advice from ISIL, a murderous organization,” Rose said. Prosecutors said Sullivan watched violent ISIL attacks on the Internet, including beheadings, expressed support for the group and destroyed religious items that belonged to his parents. His father, retires US Marines Capt. Rich Sullivan, reported his son to the police. The young Sullivan also told an undercover FBI employee that he planned to buy a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle at a gun show and tried buying hollow point ammunition to use with the gun in June 2015."
"British police treating Manchester knife attack as terrorist investigation, Europe News & Top Stories","MANCHESTER • British police confirmed yesterday that they were treating a stabbing attack which injured three people at Manchester's Victoria train station as a terrorist investigation, and were searching an address in the Cheetham Hill area of the city. ""We are treating this as a terrorist investigation,"" Chief Constable Ian Hopkins told reporters. Monday's incident, classified as critical, is being investigated by the counter-terrorism police. Officials said that a man and a woman, both in their 50s, and a police officer were treated for knife injuries following the stabbings. Witness Sam Clack, 38, a BBC radio producer, yesterday said he heard the suspect shouting ""Allah"" before and during the attack. He quoted the suspect as saying: ""As long as you keep bombing other countries, this sort of s*** is going to keep happening."" The male suspect has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, said the police. The woman suffered injuries to her face and abdomen, and the man was wounded in the abdomen, while a British Transport Police officer sustained a stab wound to the shoulder. Their injuries were described as serious but not life threatening. The two members of the public were taken to hospital. The incident happened at around 8.50pm, when many revellers would have been out enjoying New Year's Eve celebrations across the city. Mr Clack said: ""I just heard this most blood-curdling scream and looked down the platform. ""He came towards me. I looked down and saw he had a kitchen knife with a black handle with a good 12-inch (30cm) blade. It was just fear, pure fear."" Mr Clack said police officers used a stun gun and pepper spray on the suspect who had been resisting arrest, before ""six or seven"" officers jumped on the man. An attack in May 2017 killed 22 people and wounded 139 at a concert in Manchester by US singer Ariana Grande."
Terrorist charges over death of Thai tourist,"PARIS: A man suspected of supplying the gun used in the Christmas market shooting attack that killed five people in Strasbourg has been handed preliminary terror charges, according to a French judicial official close to the investigation. The official, who could not be named with the case ongoing, said the individual appeared Monday before a judge and was charged with criminal association with terrorists, as well as possessing and supplying arms in connection with a terrorist enterprise. The man is suspected of furnishing the weapon that alleged gunman Cherif Chekatt used in the Dec 11 attack, the judicial official said. He was remanded into custody. Chekatt, 29, died in a shootout with police in Strasbourg last Thursday. Two other people were arrested and detained Monday as part of the terror investigation the Paris prosecutor's office is conducting into the attack. They also were suspected of ""playing a role in supplying the firearm,"" said the official. Their arrests bring the number of suspects in custody since the attack to three; Chekatt's parents and two of his brothers were questioned by police last week and released. The death toll from the attack increased to five Sunday night after a Polish man died of his wounds in a Strasbourg hospital. Barto Orent-Niedzielski, 36, lived in the city, where he worked at the European Parliament and as a journalist. The other casualties include an Italian journalist and Anupong, the tourist from Chachoengsao. According to reports, Orent-Niedzielski fought the shooter and stopped him from entering a crowded club, possibly preventing more deaths. Polish President Andrzej Duda wrote on Twitter that ""I knew him by sight. I am shocked. I had not realised that he was the one mortally wounded protecting other people. Honour to his memory. RIP."""
"PNP nabs couple supplying arms, ammo to terrorist groups","Assault firearms and thousands of ammunition rounds believed to be the property of the Philippine Army were seized by police authorities from a couple during an entrapment operation in Valenzuela City Monday. Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Director General Oscar Albayalde said the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) received a tip from a confidential informant that the couple, Edgardo Medel, 46, and his wife Rosemarie, 34, of Daisy Street, Land Ville Subdivision, BarangayPambuan, Gapan, Nueva Ecija, were supplying bulk of unlicensed firearms and ammunition for a hefty price to Maute terrorists, the Abu Sayyaf Group and rogue politicians. Elements of NCRPO-Regional Special Operations Unit (RSOU) and Regional Intelligence Division (RID) apprehended the suspects after buying two assault rifles, a handgun, and 12, 893 rounds of live ammunition worth P1.2 million. The transaction occurred around 6:30 p.m. Sunday at the service station along North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) while the couple were onboard an L300 van (REV 675). Albayalde said the three minor children of the couple who were inside the vehicle during the buy bust were turned over to social workers following the arrest of their parents. The firearms and ammunition presented by Albayalde in Camp Crame, Quezon City Monday afternoon were stored in two crates showing markings of the Philippine Army (PA). Albayalde revealed the couple were in contact with a retired AFP soldier, who may have been the source of the high-powered firearms and ammunition which they were selling to interest groups. The PNP chief withheld the identity of the retired soldier. “I just cannot imagine the death and destruction that will result should these war materials fall into the hands of the New People’s Army or the Abu Sayyaf Group,” Albayalde said. “Part of the continuing investigation will be to determine the source of these weapons and ammunition, and to possibly identify other persons involved,” he added. The suspects who are facing charges in relation to Republic Act 10591 were brought to the NCRPO headquarters."
"Couple selling arms, ammos to terror groups nabbed"," A couple allegedly supplying ammunitions and firearms to terrorist groups and private armed groups in Mindanao were arrested in Nueva Ecija on Sunday. The police said the war materiel worth millions of pesos seized from the couple’s possession may have come from a government arsenal. The cache of ammunitions consisting of 12,893 rounds for M-60 machine gun and armalite assault rifle and two high-powered firearms were intercepted by operatives of the National Capital Region Police Office from a Nueva Ecija based couple at 6 pm on Sunday. NCRPO director Guillermo Eleazar identified the alleged illegal arms dealer as Edgardo and Rosemarie Medel, residents of Landville Subdivision, Barangay Pambuan, Gapan, Nueva Ecija. The ammunitions were placed inside a wooden box with an Armed Forces of the Philippines markings. Investigators suspect that the war materiels came from a government arsenal. The seizure of cache of ammunitions, prompted Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana to order an investigation into the matter. “We’ll investigate how these ammo ended up in the wrong hands,” he said. The operation was made after NCRPO operatives acted on reports from their colleagues in Mindanao that arms supplies are being provided by the Medel couple who had also figured in previous arms transactions in Mindanao. Prior to the seizure, operatives conducted a test buy of ammunition from Medel, who told undercover security officials that they can supply as many as 10 rifles.The NCRPO operatives then initiated a buybust operations, sending undercover agents to purchase the weapons and ammunitions worth P1.2 million. At 6:30 pm, the couple arrived on aboard a white van bearing license plate REV 675 at the service station along NLEX where the transaction was made. The couple were immediately arrested after accepting the P1.2 million marked money from two undercover female operatives who posed as buyers of the weapons and ammunition purportedly to be used for the upcoming midterm elections in 2019. PNP Chief Oscar Abayalde said they have identified the couple’s sources, who, according to the suspects, was a retired military soldier from Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija. “We have names actually for verification allegedly meron siyang connection sa Fort Magsaysay,” Albayalde said. The PNP chief have yet to identify the source, but said that the alleged military officer could have been keeping the firearms and ammunitions for a time when he was still in active duty and decided to dispose of them only now. When asked if the ammunitions came from the Philippine Army, Albayalde said yes, but added that he will talk to Philippine Army authorities to determine the “lot numbers” of the firearms which could easily be traced to the unit that disposed them. “I just cannot imagine the death and destruction that will result should these war materials fall into the hands of the New People’s Army or the Abu Sayyaf Group,” Albayalde said."
Egyptian forces kill 40 suspected militants after tourist bus bombed,"CAIRO (REUTERS) - Egyptian security forces have killed 40 suspected militants in three separate incidents in North Sinai and Giza, the Interior Ministry said on Saturday, a day after a bombing on a Vietnamese tourist bus in Giza killed four people. The bombing, less than 4 km from the pyramids, on the outskirts of Cairo, is the first deadly attack against foreign tourists in Egypt for more than a year and comes as the tourism sector, a vital source of foreign currency, recovers from a sharp drop in visitor numbers since the country’s 2011 uprising. A spokesman for Britain’s Thomas Cook travel group said it had cancelled day trips to Cairo from the Red Sea resort of Hurghada following the attack and it would continue to review the security situation. The ministry did not say whether the suspected militants were connected to Friday’s attack, but said its forces killed 30 people during raids on their hideouts in Giza where it said “terrorist elements” were planning a series of attacks targeting state institutions and the tourism industry. Security forces also killed 10 suspected militants in North Sinai, where the country is fighting an insurgency led by Islamic State. State news agency MENA said that the suspects were killed in a gun battle. The ministry did not give any details about the suspects’ identity or whether there had been any casualties or injuries among the security forces. The statement said the three raids took place simultaneously. The ministry published photos of bloodied bodies with their faces concealed and assault rifles and shotguns lying on the floor beside them. Three Vietnamese tourists and an Egyptian guide were killed and at least 10 others injured when the roadside bomb hit their tour bus on Friday. Events such as the bombing of a Russian airliner shortly after it took off from Sharm el Sheikh in 2015, killing all 224 people on board, caused tourist numbers to Egypt to plunge. There are still no direct flights from major tourist markets such as Britain and Russia to the country’s biggest Red Sea resort, Sharm el Sheikh, since that attack. The government says fighting Islamist militants is a priority as it works to restore stability after the years of turmoil that followed the “Arab Spring” protests of 2011. Egypt’s military and police launched a major campaign against militant groups in February, targeting the Sinai Peninsula as well as southern areas and the border with Libya."
 Northern Ireland policeman injured in 'terrorist' attack,"BELFAST, Jan 23 — A police officer in Belfast was injured in a suspected drive-by shooting on yesterday in what Northern Ireland’s Police Federation said amounted to a “terrorist gun attack”. The incident happened at a petrol station in north Belfast at around 7.30pm, police said on Twitter. He was hit in the arm. There have been a number of bomb and gun attacks in recent years on police officers in Northern Ireland, which endured three decades of violence before a peace accord was signed in 1998. The Police Federation, which represents officers, said the incident amounted to a “terrorist gun attack”. Chairman Mark Lindsay condemned the shooting and warned officers to remain at high alert. “This attack on the life of an officer is a stark reminder of the determination on the part of terrorists to murder and maim police officers,” he said in a statement.

The attack comes as Northern Ireland prepares for snap elections on March 2 after the power-sharing executive collapsed earlier this month. — AFP"

 ‘Bato’ exhorts gun owners to help govt fight terrorists,"PHILIPPINE National Police chief Ronald dela Rosa said gun holders and owners can help the government fight terrorists, like the ones who overran Marawi City in May. “I wish all gun owners would unite so they can stop a repeat of the Marawi siege,” Dela Rosa said in Filipino during an arms show in Mandaluyong City. He said organized gun owners could deter terrorist groups. “I wish all the gun holders for example in the cities of Cotabato, Davao, Iligan, and Cagayan de Oro would organize themselves so that they can become a deterrent to a possible takeover like the Marawi siege,” he said. Dela Rosa said licensed and trained gun holders could shoot it out with terrorists before the military arrived. Dela Rosa said he already organized gun owners in Davao City so they could fight off terrorists. On Friday, military spokesman Maj. Gen. Restituto Padilla said government troops found more firearms and explosive devices in different parts of Marawi City. These included nine high-powered firearms and explosives buried in the shallow waters of Lake Lanao and at the village of Torongan, also in Lanao del Sur.Padilla said soldiers found two M16 machine guns, three rifles and two grenade launchers buried in Barangay Torongan. Two other high-powered firearms were found near the lake, Padilla added. The latest recover brought to 399 the number of firearms recovered by security forces who are conducting clearing operations in Marawi City. Troops also found 16 unused explosive devices, he said. In the main battle area and surrounding areas, troops were scouring for explosive devices and potential booby traps before residents would be allowed back into their homes. Padilla said 10 more villages would be cleared next week."

Man shot dead at Paris Orly airport after seizing soldier's gun,"PARIS • Security forces shot dead a man who seized a soldier's gun at Paris Orly airport in France yesterday, less than two hours after the same man shot and wounded a police officer during a routine check, the Interior Ministry said. The incident triggered a major security scare that shut down the airport and left thousands of travellers stranded. It took place at around 8.30am local time (3.30pm Singapore time) in the Orly-Sud terminal at the smaller of Paris' two international airports, located south of the capital. The man, identified as Ziyed Ben Belgacem in media reports, tried to snatch a gun from a female soldier ""in an extremely violent attack"" on her before he was shot dead, a French army spokesman said. Mr Benoit Brulon, a spokesman for France's anti-terror patrol force, said of the female soldier: ""She's doing fine."" Mr Brulon, speaking on BFMTV, said that the female soldier fell to the ground as she struggled with her attacker. ""It was then that her comrades opened fire to protect her and people around,"" he said. Separately, Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henri Brandet said it was ""possible"", but had yet to be established, that the incident could be called a terrorist attack. ""There's possibly a terrorist motive, but that's something the justice system will have to ascertain, and it will do so in due time,"" Mr Brandet told reporters. Interior Minister Bruno Le Roux said that the slain man had been linked to an earlier attack on police during a routine traffic inspection in the northern suburb of Garges-les-Gonesse at around 7am, in which an officer was slightly wounded in the head. He then continued south to steal another car in the suburb of Vitry-sur-Seine about 10km from Orly airport. In Vitry, he also ""burst into a bar and threatened those present"", Mr Le Roux said. The Journal du Dimanche said that the suspect, a 39-year-old French citizen, was known for robbery and drug trafficking. His home was searched in 2015, the paper reported. A police source described him as a radicalised Muslim. The anti-terrorism prosecutor has opened an investigation. BFMTV, without giving a source, said the attacker had texted his father, saying: ""I've screwed up. I've shot a policeman."" Police also searched his house in Garges-les-Gonesse, in the multiethnic Seine-Saint-Denis area. A witness to the events at the airport told BFMTV that he saw the man in possession of the soldier's rifle and threatening her. ""The soldiers were trying to reason with him,"" he said, adding that as he fled the scene he heard two shots. Mr Franck Lecam, a traveller bound for Tel Aviv, said that he heard ""three or four shots"" nearby as he was queuing to check in. ""There are policemen, emergency workers and soldiers everywhere,"" he said, after being forced to evacuate the terminal with around 3,000 others. Air traffic to Orly was suspended and all incoming flights rerouted to Charles de Gaulle airport, in the north of Paris. Several planes that were preparing for take-off or had just landed in Orly were grounded on the tarmac while the security operation unfolded. Passengers in the nearby Orly-Ouest terminal were confined in the building. Elite police teams intervened quickly to secure the airport and search it for possible explosives, but none were found. By early afternoon, Orly-Ouest had reopened and flights had started to resume. Orly-Sud had reopened to incoming flights, but outgoing flights were still suspended. The incidents come five weeks before France holds presidential elections, and on the second day of an official visit to Paris by Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate."
Recent terror attacks in region linked to death of IS's Wanndy: DPM,"KUALA LUMPUR: Recent terror attacks in Mindanao, Bangkok and Jakarta are linked to the killing of Malaysian Islamic State (IS) terrorist Muhammad Wanndy Jedi, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said today. He cautioned the public to be on the alert and keep a lookout for suspicious activities. The public, he said, should not take the incidents overseas lightly since they could easily occur in Malaysia if authorities are not cautious and if preventive measures are not in place. ""Malaysia's counterterrorism department is always on the watch (for suspicious activities). ""The recent bombing in Manchester could happen in this region. ""The police and counterterrorism department are on high alert following the attacks in Manchester and Jakarta. Plain-clothes officers are patrolling several hotspots,"" Zahid told a press conference after attending the Big Splash Open Data event here today. He noted that Malaysia's Intelligence Unit has identified Katibah Nusantara, a Malay archipelago unit linked to the IS, operating in this region. Zahid added that Malaysia is working closely with neighbouring countries in information-sharing and is cooperating with Interpol and Aseanapol to combat terrorism. Yesterday, two suspected suicide bombers killed three Indonesian police officers and injured 10 people in twin blasts near a bus station in Jakarta. On Monday, 22 people died and 59 others were badly wounded when Salman Abedi, a 22-year-old Briton of Libyan descent, detonated a homemade bomb at a crowded concert hall in Manchester. Hours earlier, a bomb explosion at the Royal Thai Army-affiliated Phramongkutklao Hospital, also known as the King Mongkut Hospital, injured 24 people. In addition, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte declared martial law on the country’s southern island of Mindanao after about 100 Muslim fighters laid siege to a major city following a deadly gun battle with government forces on Tuesday.

"Before Parliament violence, other attacks on Britain","Britain has been targeted anew by what authorities are calling a terrorist incident. A look at other attacks on the country in recent years: An attacker stabbed a police officer at Britain's Parliament before being shot by police, while a vehicle ran over pedestrians on nearby Westminster Bridge at around the same time. One woman was killed, others injured. An Islamic State-inspired taxi driver tried to behead a passenger in the east London Underground station of Leytonstone. Somali-born Muhiddin Mire was sent to a high-security mental hospital to serve a life sentence. The judge ruled that Mire had been motivated by events in Syria. The incident came days after Parliament approved British airstrikes on Islamic State group targets in Syria. Two British-born, al-Qaida-inspired extremists stabbed off-duty soldier Lee Rigby to death on a busy south London street. The men ran Rigby down with their vehicle and then used a cleaver to hack him to death. Images of attacker Michael Adebolajo holding a butcher knife and cleaver with bloodied hands in the moments after killing shocked people around the world and sparked fears of Islamist extremism in Britain. Adebolajo and his accomplice were sentenced to life in prison. Two men were arrested after they drove a Jeep Cherokee into Glasgow Airport's terminal in Scotland and set it ablaze. Authorities said the attack was linked to a failed car bombing a day before in London's West End, where an ambulance crew outside a nightclub spotted smoke coming from a Mercedes that turned out to be rigged with explosives. A second Mercedes also filled with explosives was found hours later in an impound lot. In the worst peacetime attack on Britain this century, four Al-Qaida-inspired bombers blew themselves up on three subway trains and a bus in London, killing 52. Three of the bombers were British-born, all of Pakistani descent; the other emigrated from Jamaica. (**)"
Arrested Terror Suspects Closely Linked to Islamic State: Nat'l Police,"Jakarta. Eight terror suspects arrested in a series of raids on the outskirts of Jakarta this week are Islamic State supporters who were allegedly involved in attacks and the smuggling of firearms, police said on Friday (24/03). One alleged terrorist was shot dead after resisting arrest during an operation in Cilegon, Banten, on Thursday. Three others were arrested and a pistol was confiscated. Police identified the deceased as Nanang Kosim, whom they said attended meetings by Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) in Batu, Malang, East Java, in late November. The JAD unites small Islamic State-supporting terrorist cells in Indonesia. The group is led by Aman Abdurrahman, a cleric currently imprisoned on Nusakambangan Island at Cilacap, Central Java. Police have named Aman as one of the masterminds behind the terrorist attack in Jalan Thamrin, Central Jakarta, in January last year, which resulted in the death of four people, including the attackers. Investigations showed that Nanang had assisted a militant identified as Abu Asybal in his bid to evade police raids following the attack. Police said along with the three militants who were arrested this week, Nanang also planned to train militants in Halmahera, North Maluku. He allegedly also supplied the JAD with M16 assault rifles. Officers identified those arrested as Ahmad Supriyanto, Icuk Pamulang and Abdul Majid – who was shot in the arm during Thursday's raid. Hours before moving against the four terror suspects, the National Police's anti-terrorism squad, Densus 88, arrested four others in Pandeglang and South Tangerang in Banten and Bekasi in West Java. Police identified the suspect arrested in Bekasi only by the initials S.M., whom they said funded the Thamrin attack. He also had links to terrorist networks in the southern Philippines, who supplied him with the firearms that were used in the Thamrin attack, police said. ""There were two firearms used in the Thamrin bomb attack. It turns out that they were bought from the Philippines,"" National Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Martinus Sitompul said at his office in Jakarta. Indonesia has seen a series or Islamic State-linked attacks since the one in Jakarta, but police have also managed to thwart several other plots, and arrested dozens of suspects across the country."
Bomb blast at Athens headquarters of media group,"ATHENS, Dec 17 — A bomb blast early today caused minor damage to a building in Athens housing the headquarters of Greece's private radio and television network Skai, but there were no casualties, police said. The homemade device went off at around 2:30am (0030 GMT), 45 minutes after an anonymous telephone warning to another TV network.

PNP defends ML implementation in Mindanao amid Cotabato bomb attack," Security forces could not guard every inch of Mindanao from terrorist groups, a police official said yesterday following a bomb attack in Cotabato City on Tuesday despite the martial law implementation in the southern part of the country for more than a year now. Chief Supt. Benigno Durana, Jr., spokesman of the Philippine National Police (PNP), also defended the martial law implementation, saying there could have been more attacks if it is not existing in the entire Mindanao. “There could have been more attacks from local terror groups if martial law was not imposed in Mindanao,” said Durana. The entire Mindanao has been under martial law since the Marawi City siege in May 2017. Recently, Congress has approved the extension of martial law for one year, or until December 31, 2019, citing the continuing rebellion in Mindanao. Critics and members of the opposition have been rejecting the extension of martial law, Mindanao security could still be ensured like in the past even without it. Netizens have also been raising questions as to why the bombing in front of a mall in Cotabato City that left two dead and more than 30 injured still happened when Mindanao was supposed to be under tight watch due to martial law. But Durana said more than the presence of soldiers, public cooperation and vigilance are still essential to thwart any terror attack, especially form ISIS-inspired local groups. “The security forces cannot guard every inch of Mindanao. That’s why the people’s cooperation and vigilance not just security sector’s vigilance is equally if not much more important in keeping our communities safe and secure,” said Durana. He stressed that the same terror problems are still being experienced by much-more developed countries. “But one way or the other one or two incidents may fall on some cracks. This is true not only in the Philippines but also in much more developed countries like in Europe that are likewise facing the same global problem of terrorism,” said Durana. He however said that the security situation on Mindanao has been improved because of the martial law. The same reason was also raised by proponents of martial law when they sought for martial law extension. Security officials would also argue that Mindanao people have been supportive of the martial law. “Safety and security wise, the people of Mindanao are in a much better shape now due to the signed peace agreements with MNLF (Moro National Liberation Front) and recently the MILF that brought, despite some challenges, a much more stable peace and security and much more positive economic outlook in Mindanao than at any other times in its history,” said Durana."
Blast triggers travel warning,"Australia and the United Kingdom have cautioned their citizens against traveling to Mindanao in the wake of recent“Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in the Philippines, including in Manila,” an advisory from the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office said. “Terrorist groups continue to  plan attacks and have the capacity and the intent to carry out attacks at any time and anywhere in the country, including in places visited by foreigners, like airports, shopping malls, public transport, including the metro system, and places of worship.” The advisory citedthat killed two people and wounded 34 others. Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade cautioned its citizens against travel to central and western Mindanao, including Sulu and the Zamboanga Peninsula. The military said Wednesday. Although the latest advisory focused on Mindanao, the FCO also advised against non-essential travel to points south of Cebu due to threat of terrorism.“Terrorist groups continue to plan kidnap operations against western nationals in the Philippines. This threat extends throughout the Philippines, both on land and at sea, but is particularly acute in the southern Philippines [Mindanao, Palawan and central Visayas, including Siquijor and Dumaguete],” the UK advisory said. The United Kingdom also cited the report of American authorities that highlighted “poor aviation security” at the capital’s main airport. “Additional security measures are in place on flights departing from this airport to the UK. You should cooperate fully with security officials. The UK keeps aviation security measures under constant review, in conjunction with international partners and the aviation industry,” the advisory said. The United Kingdom said that some 154,000 British nationals visited the Philippines in 2015. “Most visits are trouble-free,” it said. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana played down the British advisory, saying it was nothing unusual. “The British advisory is an automatic and default warning of governments to their nationals like we also do when these things happen in other countries,” Lorenzana said. Meanwhile, the US Embassy in Manila condemned the recent bombing in Cotabato. “We offer condolences to the loved ones of the victims and hope for a quick recovery for the injured,” it said in a statement. A ranking military official said Wednesday intense disagreements over the BOL could be behind the Cotabato blast, but said they have not ruled out possible extortion by communist rebels.Close to 2.8 million voters are expected to cast their votes during the BOL plebiscite on Jan. 21, 2019 in the areas of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, Isabela City in Basilan and Cotabato City. Separate voting will be held on Feb. 6, 2019, for those residing in Lanao del Norte, except Iligan City and six North Cotabato municipalities. Armed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff Lt. Gen. Benjamin Madrigal assured the public that security forces are doing everything they can to prevent a repeat of the blast in Cotabato City. Police have formed a special task group to speed up the investigation of the mall bombing. Chief Supt. Eliseo Tam Rasco, police director for Region 12, said the task group in coordination with the military and other security agencies, is looking at all possible angles and motives behind the Dec. 31 bombing in front of South Seas Mall. “I admit the suspects slipped past our tight security,” Rasco told reporters here Tuesday. The special task group South Seas is headed by Senior Supt. Oliver Enmodias, PRO-12 deputy regional director for operations. Rasco said while the task group is looking at possible retaliatory attacks by Islamic State-linked group, it is also looking at possible “destabilization” by a third group opposed to the holding of a plebiscite for the Bangsamoro Organic Law later this month.  In a statement, Presidential Peace Adviser Carlito Galvez Jr. strongly condemned the bomb attack, describing it as a treacherous and a cowardly attack against humanity and the people of Cotabato City.  “In these trying times when our resolve to pursue just and enduring peace is being tested, I encourage everyone to practice sobriety and not be swayed to spread unfounded speculations relating to the incident,” Galvez said as he extended condolences to the families of the recent attack. He described the incident as an “isolated case” and said security forces are on top of the situation. “Let us not allow this incident to discourage us to unite and act as one in our collective aspiration to achieve just and enduring peace not just in Mindanao, but in the whole country,” he said."
US Embassy condemns deadly Cotabato blast,"MANILA, Philippines — The US Embassy in the Philippines on Wednesday condemned the deadly bomb attack in Cotabato City. “The U.S. Embassy in the Philippines condemns the recent bombing in Cotabato,” it said in a statement.

" Yellow Vest protesters mull over protest on Saturday after terror attack in France, Europe News & Top Stories","PARIS (BLOOMBERG) - Members of the grassroots Yellow Vests movement plan to protest in Paris and elsewhere in France on Saturday (Dec 15), even as security concerns mount following a terror attack in Strasbourg. The government hasn't decided whether to ban the protests, spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said on Thursday in an interview on C-News television. Griveaux added that security forces will be deployed regardless, since more radical elements of the movement ""may take to the streets, pillage and destroy property"". The Paris police will unveil plans by the end of Friday, a spokesman said in an e-mail. People across France have been pulling yellow vests from the trunks of their cars for more than a month to express a whole series of grievances. What began as traffic blockades has peaked in serious violence in Paris for the past two weekends. Yet the only thing the protesters really have in common is their contempt for President Emmanuel Macron. That lack of a single policy goal means that at least some protests are nearly certain to continue. Police and military forces, who've also been deployed to address tensions in some high schools and universities, now have to add terrorism into the equation. French authorities have increased the national terror alert to its highest level after a man shot people in the streets of Strasbourg on Tuesday, killing three and wounding a dozen. The suspected gunman was shot dead on Thursday in a brief gunbattle with police after being on the run for 48 hours, reports said. ""Law enforcement could be significantly distracted because of the recent terrorist attack,"" Ryan DeStefano, vice-president of security for travel risk management provider On Call International, said in an e-mailed note. ""In addition, protests provide an opportune time for radicals to engage in terrorist activities under the guise of peaceful protest."" At least one union head, Laurent Berger of the CFDT union, called for a halt to the Yellow Vest demonstrations. While some members of the Yellow Vests, named after the safety jacket required to be carried in each car, have decided to halt their protests, others remain unconvinced. In a press conference on Thursday, demonstrators from Montceau-les-Mines in eastern France said they would wouldn't stop. They found some support from both ends of France's political spectrum. Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the leftist France Unbowed party, said he was ""surprised"" the terror attack could be used to pressure those who want to demonstrate. Yellow Vests are ""not responsible for the terrorist risk"", Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Rally party, formerly known as the National Front, said, without making a specific reference to what followers of her movement should do on Saturday."
 US man allegedly planned IS-inspired attack Ohio synagogue,"US authorities on Monday charged an Ohio man with providing material support to the Islamic State for an alleged plan to carry out a mass shooting attack at a synagogue. Damon Joseph, 21, allegedly had made a detailed plan to kill worshippers at a synagogue in the city of Toledo during the Jewish Sabbath, which begins at sunset Friday and lasts until nightfall Saturday. He was arrested Friday when he picked up two semi-automatic assault rifles from a federal undercover agent. Police said the rifles had been rendered inoperable. An affidavit filed in federal court claimed Joseph was inspired by Islamic State online propaganda and the October shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue -- the worst anti-Semitic attack in modern US history in which 11 were killed. ""I admire what the guy did with the (Pittsburgh) shooting actually,"" Joseph wrote to an undercover agent, according to the affidavit. ""I can see myself carrying out this type of operation inshallah,"" he was quoted as saying, using a common Arabic-language expression which roughly translates to ""God willing."" A day before his arrest, authorities said Joseph provided a plan for his attack -- including the address of the synagogue and research to identify when more worshippers would be present. An undercover agent met Joseph at a predetermined location Friday and he took a duffel bag containing two AR-15-type rifles, according to the affidavit. He then was arrested. ""This man spent months planning a violent terrorist attack on behalf of ISIS here in the United States,"" US Attorney Justin Herdman said in a statement. ""The charges describe a calculated man fueled by an ideology of hatred and intent on killing innocent people."" Joseph came to the attention of the FBI in May, when he began distributing messages of support for the Islamic State on social media, authorities said. An undercover agent began communicating with Joseph. Over the subsequent months, he expressed an interest in supporting Islamic State propaganda operations and, eventually, to carrying out an attack. If convicted, Joseph could face up to 20 years in prison."
"Death toll in Kabul attack rises to 43, says health ministry","KABUL, Dec 25 — An hours-long gun and suicide attack on a Kabul government compound killed at least 43 people, the health ministry said today, making it one of the deadliest assaults on the Afghan capital this year. Another 10 were wounded in yesterday’s raid on a site where the Ministry of Public Works and other offices are located, spokesman Waheed Majroh said. Gunmen stormed the compound mid-afternoon after detonating a car bomb at the entrance, sending terrifying government workers running for their lives. Some jumped from the windows.

9 hurt as car crashes into New Year's crowd in Tokyo,"TOKYO: A car ploughed into crowds celebrating New Year's Day early on Tuesday in a suspected terror attack, leaving nine people injured, including one who was unconscious. Police arrested Kazuhiro Kusakabe, 21, who was driving the rental car with an Osaka license plate, on suspicion of attempted murder. Investigative sources quoted the man as saying he had perpetrated an act of terrorism ""in retaliation for an execution"" and ""would not make any excuse"" for his act. It was not immediately clear whether he was referring to a specific execution or Japan's system of capital punishment. Kusakabe told the police he had driven from Osaka and intended to kill the pedestrians he hit. There was a tank of kerosene in the rental car, which he said he planned to use to burn the vehicle, the investigative sources said. Eight people were hit by the car, including a teenage boy who is in critical condition, the police said. Another man was slightly injured after Kusakabe allegedly struck him after getting out of the car, the police said. Kusakabe fled the scene, but the police found him in a nearby park about half an hour later. The incident happened shortly after midnight local time on Monday in a popular tourist area of Harajuku, near Meiji Shrine, in central Tokyo. ""I can't believe it, this is a place I'm familiar with, so it's very shocking,"" said Tatsuhiro Yaegashi, a 27-year-old worker in the area."
MILF denounces Cotabato mall blast; military sees terror hand,"Cotabato City—The Moro Islamic Liberation Front has added its voice to those condemning the bomb attack that killed two persons and wounded 31 others along a busy thoroughfare outside a mall on Monday. At the same time, the Bangsamoro Transition Commission under MILF first vice chairman Ghazzali Jaafar urged the Office of the President to direct national law enforcement agencies to help determine the real perpetrators of the bomb attack and bring them to justice. In an official statement sent to news organizations, MILF Chairman Hadji Murad Ibrahim said the MILF “condemns in the highest possible terms” Monday’s bomb attack. “The dastardly act of [placing] an improvised explosive device [IED] with intent to kill or harm civilians is an act of cowardice, inhuman, and atrocious,” Murad said. Murad called on “concerned authorities to sincerely and thoroughly investigate this evil act”—saying that ascribing any motive would be too premature at this time. “We ask the authorities to examine all angles and make the result of the same public. We should not allow any party or group to make premature conclusions or draw insinuations so as to advance their own personal interest and political agenda,” he said. He said the MILF sympathizes with the victims, and that the families of the fatalities and the wounded deserved true justice. He said it is for the reason of securing the community that the MILF and the government, together with all their partners in the peace process, have pushed hard for the passage of Bangsamoro Organic Law” to establish a “government that can really protect and promote the peace and security of the place and its peoples.” In a BTC statement, Jaafar said it was unfortunate that one of the fatalities was an employee--Jonathan Torribiano, who was a driver for BTC Commissioner Melanio Ulama. Lawyer Naguib Sinarimbo, secretary-general of the MILF’s United Bangsamoro Justice Party, said while residents should be thankful for a prompt defusing of “explosives found in the baggage counter of the mall,” reports falsely identified Nur Misuari, founding chairman of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) as the owner of the South Seas Mall. Sinarimbo said residents knew that the mall is not owned by Misuari but by the Lim family, who have been engaged in legitimate businesses after settling in Tawi-Tawi in the early 1960s when Misuari was still virtually unknown. Military officials said they believed the Islamic State-linked Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters had a hand in the bombing. Among those injured in Monday’s bombing, which came at about 2 p.m., were 10 minors, according to Maj. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, the commander of the Army’s 6th Infantry Division (ID). He said an initial investigation led to the BIFF, which has shifted to attacking non-combatants, starting with the twin bombings in Isulan in September 2018. “We are not discounting the possibility that the Daesh-inspired group was responsible in the bombing,” Sobejana said. Senior Supt. Rolly Octavio, city police director, said police are reviewing the closed circuit TV (CCTV) camera footage taken at South Seas Mall to help identify the perpetrators. “Our authorities have the information about the suspects, as to the motive, that is being determined,” Cotabato City Mayor Cynthia Guiani-Sayadi said in a news conference some two hours after the blast. Octavio said bomb experts recovered about one kilo of cut nails, a plastic container with traces of black powder and broken parts of a mobile phone at the blast site.In a follow-up operation inside the mall, police found another bomb in the second-floor baggage counter left by a still unidentified man. “A CCTV captured the man’s facial features,” Octavio said. Gov. Mujiv Hataman of the 00Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao also condemned the attack, calling those behind it “evil.” “We are irrevocably grieved about the casualties incurred, thoroughly condemn this act, and call for a thorough investigation. We need to make sure acts like these never happen again, and that the perpetrator is brought to justice,” Hataman said in a statement released Monday. Cotabato City, though not part of ARMM, hosts the administrative center of the region through its Shariff Kabunsuan Complex here. Hataman urged investigators to look deeply into the case and ensure that civilians do not get caught up in terror. “We cannot afford to be divisive at this moment. Only by melding together can we bring about peace and justice,” he said. He urged civil leaders and security officials to remain united. “What we need is to be composed, to redouble our efforts, and to hold on to our dream of peace in the region. We cannot be divided on this front,” Hataman added. The Japanese government and the European Union on Tuesday stood in solidarity with the Philippines following the mall bombing. As a country “strongly condemning violent extremism,” Japan stands in solidarity with the government and the people of the Philippines, Japanese Ambassador Koji Haneda said in a statement. EU Ambassador Franz Jessen, meanwhile, said his thoughts and prayers go to the victims as he reiterated the bloc’s support to the ongoing peace process in Mindanao. “The EU fully supports the ongoing peace process in Mindanao. I frequently visit Cotabato and am impressed each time by the progress made, and the commitment of my counterparts to build a better future for the region. Peace and reconciliation is the way forward. Violence and hatred will never succeed,” he said in a separate statement. “The New Year brings new hope to us all, and we stand together with the Philippine government in its efforts to make the country more peaceful and safer,” he added."
French extremist in court for Brussels Jewish museum attack trial,"BRUSSELS (AFP) – A French extremist appeared in court yesterday ahead of his trial for shooting dead four people at a Jewish museum in Brussels in 2014 following his return from Syria. Mehdi Nemmouche, accused of being the first battle-hardened extremist to stage a terror attack on European soil, faces a life sentence if convicted over the killing spree in the Belgian capital on May 24, 2014. Both Nemmouche, 33, and Nacer Bendrer, a fellow Frenchman aged 30 who allegedly supplied the weapons, deny charges of ‘terrorist murder’. Nemmouche, wearing a blue sweater, spoke only to confirm his identity as the hearing began at 10.30am. “Nemmouche, Mehdi, 33 years old, unemployed,” he told the criminal court in Brussels, which spent the day yesterday selecting the 12-member jury ahead of the start of the full trial on Thursday. More than 100 witnesses are due to testify at the trial, which will be attended by the victims’ families and Jewish community leaders, who have denounced the anti-Semitic nature of the attack. And more than 300 Belgian and foreign journalists have registered to cover the proceedings which could last until the end of February. The deadly attack, which lasted only 82 seconds, shocked Belgium and the world. Firing a pistol and then an assault rifle, the gunman killed two Israeli tourists, a French volunteer and a Belgian receptionist at the Jewish Museum. Nemmouche – born to a family of Algerian origin in the northern French town of Roubaix – was arrested six days after the attack. He was caught in the southern French port city of Marseille after arriving on a bus from Brussels, carrying a handgun and an assault rifle."
"Three killed, 13 injured in Strasbourg attack","Police motorcycles drives in the streets of Strasbourg, eastern France, after a shooting breakout, on Tuesday. FREDERICK FLORIN/AFP Three people were killed and 13 wounded, eight seriously, when a gunman opened fire at a famed Christmas market in the eastern French city of Strasbourg, officials said on Wednesday. “The attacker, who was on the S list [of extremists watched by police], is actively being hunted by security forces,” local officials said in a statement. Some 350 people, including police, troops and helicopters, were on the heels of the attacker who had “sowed terror” in the city, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said. The killer opened fire at around 1900 GMT (2am in Cambodia) on one of the city’s busiest streets, sending crowds of evening shoppers fleeing for safety. Soldiers patrolling the area as part of regular anti-terror operations exchanged fire with the suspect and wounded him, but could not stop him escaping, police sources said. A soldier was slightly injured by a ricohet from a shot by the gunman. Castaner also said France had raised its security alert level to “emergency attack” with “the implementation of reinforced border controls and tightened controls on all Christmas markets in France to avoid the risk of a copycat” attack. The gunman has been identified and was on a watchlist of suspected extremists, a statement from local security services said. France’s security forces, already on high alert after a series of terror attacks since 2015, are particularly stretched at the moment due to anti-government protests that have swept the country. “I heard shooting and then there was pandemonium,” said one witness, who gave his name as Fatih. “People were running everywhere.” He said he had seen three people injured on the ground only a few metres from the giant Christmas tree in the centre of the city. Shortly after the shooting, lines of police vehicles and ambulances streamed into the market area, under festive lights declaring the city the “capital of Christmas”. “We heard several shots, three perhaps, and we saw people running,” one witness said anonymously. “One of them fell down, I don’t know whether it was because she was tripped up or if she was hit,” the witness said. President Emmanuel Macron expressed on Twitter the solidarity of the whole nation after holding a crisis meeting with cabinet officials in Paris. Two separate security sources said on condition of anonymity that the shooter was believed to be a 29-year-old from the city, whose name was given as Cherif, and who was set to be arrested on Tuesday morning. He was being investigated over an attempted murder, one of the sources said. Several areas neighbouring the Christmas market were sealed off on Tuesday night and residents were being told to stay indoors. Many people took refuge in local restaurants and bars which pulled down their shutters. “We let everyone inside, down into the wine cellar. They’re locked in there,” said local restaurant owner Mouad, 33. A police source, again speaking on condition of anonymity, said security forces had opened fire in an area of the city where the suspect was thought to be hiding. The source did not give the address and it was unclear if the shooter had been located. Specialist anti-terror prosecutors have opened an investigation into the incident in Strasbourg, which lies on the border with Germany. Several residents of the city have been detained in recent years for trying to reach jihadist groups in Syria, or have been arrested upon their return. “Shocked and saddened by the terrible attack in Strasbourg. My thoughts are with all of those affected and with the French people,” British Prime Minister Theresa May wrote on Twitter. The Strasbourg-based European Parliament was also on lockdown, with MEPs, staff and journalists unable to leave the building. In a parliament bar usually reserved for MEPs, EU commissioners, powerful legislators and staffers huddled in small groups waiting for developments. “Our first thought was for colleagues who had already made it to the centre of town, who are safe,” Belgian MEP Kathleen Van Brempt said. Security has been stepped up in recent years after a series of attacks in France by Islamist gunmen and the Strasbourg market was long considered a possible target. Three years after groups of jihadists gunned down and blew up 130 people in Paris on November 13, 2015, French counter-terror officials say their focus has shifted. Rather than coordinated attacks, their main concern is attacks by “lone wolves” – self-radicalised individuals acting without links to terror groups such as Islamic State. A total of 246 people have been killed in terror attacks in France since 2015, according to an AFP toll."

Suicide bomber hits Kurdish-run base in Syria - IS,"AMMAN: Islamic State said one of its suicide bombers killed some people on Monday at a military base in Syria’s Raqqa city, which is under control of a U.S.- backed and Kurdish-led militia. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), led by Kurds, said a militant blew himself up in a blast that killed one civilian and injured several of its fighters. Though the SDF did not say where the blast took place, two Raqqa residents reached by Reuters said they heard an explosion in a central district of the city housing military offices. The ultra hardline jihadist Islamic State’s (IS) claim of responsibility came in a statement by the affiliated Amaq news agency. It said the attack targeted a recruitment centre in Raqqa and that 17 people were killed or wounded. Amaq said the bomber, whom it named as Abu Abdullah al Shami, had first used his machine gun then detonated a vest. The SDF also said earlier it had clashed with IS fighters who infiltrated through an old tunnel in the city near an outpost where their fighters were stationed. The Kurdish-led alliance seized the city in Syria’s northeast from Islamic State with the help of U.S.-led air strikes in 2017. Raqqa, which IS declared the capital of its self-proclaimed caliphate, was taken by the SDF six years into Syria’s civil war after a protracted battle that killed thousands of civilians and wrecked much of the city. Rebuilding and restoring Raqqa, which was once home to more than 300,000 people, is proving a monumental task. Since losing almost all the large swathes of territory it took in lightning offensives in Syria and Iraq in 2014-15, IS has returned to deadly hit-and-run attacks and ambushes. Some people in Raqqa resent effective Kurdish control over the predominately Arab city, with many objecting to compulsory enlistment to its forces, heavy taxes on civilians and a tight security grip where dissent is not tolerated. --Reuters"
No Filipino casualties in attacks in Brazil and France,"MANILA, Philippines — No Filipinos were reported to be among the casualties in the shooting incidents in Brazil and France, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said. In a statement on Wednesday, the DFA said that Ambassador to Brazil Marichu Mauro and Ambassador to France Ma. Theresa Lazaro informed the DFA home office “that so far there have been no reports of any Filipinos among the dead and injured in the two incidents.” According to Mauro, four people were killed when a gunman on Tuesday opened fire at the end of the midday services at the Metropolitan Cathedral in the city of Campinas, 100 kilometers north of Sao Paolo. Mauro said the motive behind the shooting was still under investigation as the suspect, who killed himself after the incident, reportedly had no criminal record. Meanwhile, Lazaro said that three people were killed while 12 others were left wounded after a gunman opened fire near a popular Christmas market in Strasbourg, 490 kilometers east of Paris Tuesday evening. Lazaro added that “the French government had categorized the incident as a terror attack and had raised the risk level to the highest category.” /atm"
Man acquitted of terror charge over Buckingham Palace sword attack,"LONDON, Dec 20 — An Uber driver was found not guilty yesterday of a terror charge after he injured police officers arresting him outside Queen Elizabeth II's Buckingham Palace residence while he was armed with a Samurai sword. Mohiussunnath Chowdhury, 27, was unanimously acquitted by jurors at England's Old Bailey central criminal court in London of one charge of preparing acts of terrorism, following a retrial. Two unarmed officers had suffered cuts to their hands when they tried to disarm him near the monarch's famous London residence in August 2017. They feared for their lives during the confrontation as Chowdhury repeatedly shouted “Allahu Akbar.” The court also heard he supported terrorism by the Islamic State group, and had sent a suicide note to his sister “expressing hate of the queen and her soldiers.” But during his trial Chowdhury, from the town of Luton, north of London, told jurors he only wanted to be killed by police and had no intention to hurt anyone himself. After the not guilty verdict was read out, he saluted the jurors who had spent 11 hours and 36 minutes considering his fate. A spokesman for England's Crown Prosecution Service said Chowdhury had been charged with “the most appropriate offence” and would face no further prosecution over the incident. — AFP"
UK counter-terror police probe Manchester knife attack,"MANCHESTER: British counter-terrorism police were investigating a multiple stabbing in which the suspect reportedly shouted ""Allah"" at a Manchester railway station on New Year's Eve, officials said Tuesday. A man and a woman, both in their 50s, and a police officer were being treated for knife injuries following the stabbings on Monday evening at Manchester Victoria station in the northwestern English city. Witness Sam Clack, 38, a BBC radio producer, said he heard the suspect shouting ""Allah"" before and during the attack. He quoted the suspect as saying: ""As long as you keep bombing other countries, this sort of shit is going to keep happening."" The male suspect has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said in a statement. The woman suffered injuries to her face and abdomen and the man was wounded in the abdomen, while a British Transport Police officer sustained a stab wound to the shoulder. Their injuries were described as serious but not life-threatening. The two members of the public were taken to hospital. The incident happened at around 8.50pm (3.50am on Tuesday in Thailand), when many revellers in the city would have been enjoying New Year's Eve celebrations. 'Blood-curdling scream' Clack said: ""I just heard this most blood-curdling scream and looked down the platform. ""He came towards me. I looked down and saw he had a kitchen knife with a black handle with a good 12 inch (30-centimetre) blade. ""It was just fear, pure fear."" Clack said police officers used a stun gun and pepper spray before, ""six or seven"" officers jumped on the man. Clack said he heard the alleged knifeman shouting ""Allah"" during the attack. He added: ""He shouted it before, he shouted it during it -- 'Allah'."" A witness who gave her name as Rebekka told the Daily Mirror newspaper: ""I heard the most blood-curdling scream I've ever heard and turned to see everyone running towards me. ""I jumped off the tram track and started to run down the tram lines and hid behind some concrete slabs under one of the arches. ""I was just really scared, I didn't know if I was going to die."" Police 'open mind' Police declared the attack a ""critical incident"". GMP Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts said the investigation was being led by counter-terrorism police and officers were keeping an ""open mind"". ""Tonight's events will have understandably worried people but I need to stress that the incident is not ongoing, a man is in custody and there is currently no intelligence to suggest that there is any wider threat at this time,"" he said. ""While we don't yet know the full circumstances and are keeping an open mind, officers from Counter Terror Policing North West are leading the investigation. ""This is to ensure we have all the expertise available to us and progress our investigation as soon as we possibly can."" The city's New Year celebrations went ahead in Albert Square despite the incident, with a firework display taking place as planned, though increased security was brought in. The city experienced a suicide attack in May 2017, when 22 people were killed and 139 wounded at a concert by the US singer Ariana Grande at the Manchester Arena. The bomber, Salman Abedi, 22, was born and raised in Manchester."
Indonesia uses tougher anti-terror law to detain suspects for holidays,"JAKARTA, Dec 20 — Indonesian police have detained about 20 suspected militants as security is stepped up ahead of the Christmas and New Year’s holiday season, a commander said today. National police chief Tito Karnavian said the detentions were made preventively under a revised anti-terrorism law approved in May, after suicide bombings claimed by Islamic State killed more than 30 people in the city of Surabaya. “There is no information yet about terror acts over Christmas and New Year’s but we are taking proactive steps including these arrests,” Karnavian told reporters. Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority country, has struggled to contain a resurgence in militancy and scores of Indonesians have travelled to the Middle East to join the Islamic State group. Near-simultaneous attacks on churches in the capital, Jakarta, and elsewhere on Christmas Eve in 2000, killed nearly 20 people. Ever since, authorities have stepped up security at churches and tourist spots for the holiday. Karnavian did not identify any of the suspects but said they were detained in various parts of the country. Under the revised law, anyone suspected of planning an attack can be held for up to 21 days for an initial inquiry and for up to 200 days for a formal investigation. — Reuters"
India busts ISIS-inspired militant group," NEW DELHI (AFP) - India's anti-terror agency on Wednesday (Dec 26) said it had busted a local militant cell inspired by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group that was planning to carry out bombings and target prominent political figures. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) said 10 members of an obscure militant group ""Harkat ul Harb-e-Islam"" were arrested in multi-city raids and a further six suspects were being questioned over their alleged links with the outfit. NIA spokesman Alok Mittal said arms and ammunition were recovered from the raids over 17 locations, including in the capital New Delhi, as the group prepped for striking several targets ahead of the high-profile Republic Day national event on Jan 26. ""They were at an advanced stage of carrying out a series of blasts,"" Mr Mittal told reporters at a press conference in New Delhi. ""They wanted to explode remote-controlled bombs and even conduct fidayeen (suicide) attacks."" Mr Mittal said the group had attempted to make suicide vests and developed a homemade rocket launcher, adding that the unknown mastermind of the module was based abroad. One of the accused is an engineer, he said. The authorities have previously claimed to have foiled similar ISIS-inspired cells but there is no evidence of the militant group's presence in the country. Indian Muslims have largely remained insulated from ISIS influence, with only a handful of young men from the country's nearly 175 million minority community joining the militant group that gained worldwide prominence after capturing large swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria in 2014. But India's security agencies have voiced concern over the radicalisation of men over the Internet. In 2014, a group of four Mumbai engineering students travelled to Iraq to join the group. One of them later returned to India. But some activists have accused security agencies of falsely charging Muslim men for terrorism, due to discrimination against the community in the Hindu-majority country of 1.25 billion people."
Look back 2018: Year of hope and despair for South-east Asia,"On Sunday, May 13, Dita Oeprianto, his wife Puji, and their two sons and two daughters, attacked three churches in Indonesia's second biggest city, Surabaya. Eighteen people were killed, including the family of six. The father attacked one church, the mother and two daughters, aged nine and 12, targeted another, and the two sons, who were 16 and 18, bombed a third church. The attacks were the first time children were involved in a suicide bombing in Indonesia, and also the first successful local suicide bombing involving a woman. The next day, another family of a couple and their daughter and two sons carried out a suicide bombing at Surabaya's police headquarters. Ten people were wounded while all the attackers were killed, except for the daughter, Aisyah, eight. The fathers from the two families were involved with Indonesia's terror network Jemaah Ansharut Daulah, which is affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria terror group. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte ordered the shutdown of the Philippines' famous holiday island of Boracay in April for six months, saying it had become a cesspool, tainted by sewage dumped directly into the sea by hotels, restaurants and businesses. The island brought in tourism revenue of some 56 billion pesos (S$1.46 billion) last year. The holiday island was reopened in October with promises of cleaner waters and beaches. The biggest scandal in the region is over state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a name now synonymous around the world with high-level corruption and embezzlement. With the shock fall of the Barisan Nasional government, the wrongdoing has been actively pursued by the new Mahathir administration, snagging former premier Najib Razak. Lorryloads of cash, luxury bags and jewellery were hauled from apartments linked to him, in probes into whether these were linked to the scandal. The Malaysian government also seized the 91.5m-long yacht Equaminity, bought by its owners for US$250 million (S$343 million), with help from Indonesia, and moved it to Port Klang, where it was later put up for auction. Najib currently faces 32 charges in Malaysia's court, including those linked to missing 1MDB funds. Malaysians changed their government for the first time in the country's modern history, voting out Barisan Nasional, which had ruled for 61 years, in a shock result at the May 9 general election. The new Pakatan Harapan government made then 92-year-old Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad the country's seventh prime minister. It was his second stint as premier after an absence of 15 years. Pakatan Harapan's victory was helped by a scandal involving state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), with some US$4.5 billion (S$6.2 billion) allegedly embezzled, and voter anger over a consumption tax. More than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled a sweeping army crackdown in Myanmar's Rakhine state last year. Many now live in cramped conditions in camps in Bangladesh. In October, Bangladesh and Myanmar agreed to repatriate hundreds of thousands of refugees. But the plan has been opposed by the Rohingya and the United Nations refugee agency and aid groups, fearing for their safety. The repatriation planned for November stalled amid protests at the refugee camps. Meanwhile, Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi - once a global human rights icon - has been criticised heavily for the crackdown, with many groups withdrawing honours they had awarded her. In October, Bangladesh and Myanmar agreed to repatriate hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees. But the plan has been opposed by the Rohingya and the United Nations refugee agency and aid groups, fearing for their safety. Thousands fell victim to natural disasters. In July and August, a series of earthquakes hit Lombok, east of Bali, killing more than 500. In September, a magnitude 7.4 earthquake and tsunami in Central Sulawesi province killed more than 2,000 people. And a tsunami hit the Sunda Strait last Saturday. Earlier, in September, Typhoon Mangkhut tore through the Philippines en route to China. More than five million people were affected. Lion Air Flight JT610 ran into trouble just after take-off from Jakarta on Oct 29, with witnesses saying it crashed at high speed into the Java Sea. All 189 on board were killed in one of the worst air disasters in Indonesia. The plane was headed for Pangkal Pinang, capital of Bangka Belitung Islands province. Lion Air was using Boeing's new 737 Max 8 aircraft. The plane had been dogged by problems on several earlier flights, including its penultimate flight the night before the crash. The world watched with bated breath as Thai navy and international cave divers carried out a daring and dangerous rescue of a youth soccer team. The 12 boys and their coach had entered the Tham Luang cave network in northern Thailand on June 23, but were trapped by rising flood waters. Three weeks passed before they were found. They were evacuated one by one, with the last person brought out on July 10. The boys and coach were praised for their bravery throughout their ordeal."
Alleged leader of Chinese consulate attack in Pakistan reported killed,"QUETTA, PAKISTAN (REUTERS) - One of the alleged masterminds of an attack by a Pakistani separatist group on the Chinese consulate in Karachi last month has been killed along with five associates, the insurgent group said on Wednesday (Dec 26). The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which opposes projects linked to China's Belt and Road infrastructure initiative in resource-rich Baluchistan, issued a statement on Tuesday confirming the death of Aslam Baloch, one of its leaders. ""The important BLA commander Aslam Baloch, along with five associates in the organisation were martyred in an enemy attack on Monday,"" Jiand Baloch, a spokesman for the separatist group said in a statement that gave no further details. Pakistan's Samaa Television reported that Aslam was killed along with a number of his commanders in a suicide attack in Aino Maina in Kandahar province, Afghanistan, across the border from Baluchistan. There was no claim of responsibility for the killings and a spokesman for the Pakistani foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment. Last month, three attackers stormed the Chinese consulate in Karachi, killing four people. Security forces killed the three attackers who were carrying explosives. Pakistan has long accused its old rival India of supporting insurgents in Baluchistan. India denies helping Baluchistan insurgents and accuses Pakistan of nurturing Islamist militants throughout the region. China has funded development of a deepwater port at Gwadar in south Baluchistan, and is also investing in other projects as part of the giant China Pakistan Economic Corridor. Baluchistan, on the borders of Afghanistan and Iran, has rich mineral and natural gas reserves but is Pakistan's poorest province. Separatists have for decades campaigned against what they see as the unfair exploitation of resources, in particular natural gas and minerals."
Communists have nothing to celebrate,"The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) on Tuesday advised peace-loving Filipinos to take extra caution and remain vigilant against attacks from the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army-National Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF) which marks its 50th founding anniversary on Wednesday, stressing that they have nothing to celebrate and no achievement to be proud of. The military said that CPP founding chairman Jose Maria Sison has ordered communist rebels them to escalate attacks and violence during the Christmas season. In a statement, AFP spokesman Colonel Noel Detoyato said the threat of heightened atrocities marks another year of violence and manifests their nature as a terror group that works to undermine the government, disrupt national development, and damage public and private properties – all to the inconvenience of the Filipino people. “As far as we, peace-loving Filipinos, are concerned, the CPP-NPA-NDF has nothing to celebrate and no achievement to be proud of,” Detoyato said. “Our soldiers on the ground and at all levels of command will continue to monitor and conduct security operations against the CPP-NPA-NDF. We are ready to secure any community threatened by them especially during this season of Christmas celebration,” he added. Detoyato said the AFP’s lines of communication are also open to those who wish to take this opportunity to abandon the armed struggle and violence perpetrated by the CPP-NPA-NDF and embrace a life of peace and prosperity with their family. The alert level, he said, will be determined by field commanders on the ground. The government had earlier rejected proposal to reciprocate the annual declaration of truce by the NPA. Meanwhile, the Philippine Ecumenical Peace Platform (PEPP), a peace advocate group, said President Duterte’s order to the military to “destroy” the NPA is worrisome. The PEPP, which is composed of five church institutions or groups, said they are particularly worried about the escalation of violence and human rights violations that will surely ensue because of such statement. “As leaders of churches in the country, we are troubled by this announcement and the escalation of violence and violation of human rights that will surely ensue,” read their statement, titled “Our Enduring Call this Christmas: Resume GRP-NDFP Peace Talks!” “As we celebrate the day of birth of Jesus Christ, the bearer of hope, we affirm our belief that peace is possible through principled dialogue and that the peace talks are still the most viable option to attain a just and enduring peace in the country,” it further read. The group said House Resolution 2339, which the House of Representatives adopted to urge President Duterte to resume peace talks with the NDFP was a piece of good news for peace advocates like them. PEPP called on President Duterte to heed the House resolution and continue the peace negotiations with the NDFP and resume the formal peace talks. (With a report from Leslie Ann G. Aquino)"
"We're entering a very risky period': Experts say ISIS not defeated, just transforming"," WASHINGTON (AFP) - Even as the last pockets of resistance in eastern Syria hold their ground, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group is shape-shifting into a new, but no less dangerous, underground form, experts warn. The group had long been ready to cede the territory it once held in its self-styled ""caliphate"", and has already begun the switch to a more clandestine role, closer to its roots. ""ISIS anticipated its battlefield defeat and the loss of the caliphate and prepared accordingly,"" said Professor Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University in Washington. ""Hundreds of ISIS fighters were able to flee Syria, bribe their way through Syria to Turkey and thereby disappear,"" he said. ""Beneath the surface, ISIS has always played the long game."" In a recent study entitled ""ISIS's Second Resurgence"", Mr Brandon Wallace and Ms Jennifer Cafarella of the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said the extremist group ""has already restructured its operations to return to a regional insurgency"". ""ISIS is finding new sources of revenue and rebuilding command-and-control over its scattered remnant forces in order to prepare for a future large-scale insurgency in both Iraq and Syria,"" the report said. The group has managed to smuggle funds to several countries around the Middle East, using front companies such as car dealerships, electronics stores, pharmacies and currency exchanges that it established in Iraq, experts said. ""We're entering a very risky period,"" said Mr Seth Jones of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). ""I have no faith that ISIS has been crushed, defeated."" ""They already have gone underground,"" he said. ""They are doing what everybody does who faces a better equipped opposition, with air and naval capabilities: They have to face Russian air strikes, cruise missiles."" ""What do you do in a case like that?"" he said. ""You disperse, you don't operate in platoon-size positions the way they did in 2014, you go underground, you build your clandestine network, you conduct targeted assassinations, IEDs (roadside bombs), and you wait for opportunities."" Data collected by the CSIS show that in some provinces in Iraq, such as Kirkuk in the north-east, the number of attacks attributed to ISIS doubled last year from 2017, with an average of 75 a month. The group has regularly picked off tribal leaders, government officials, police and members of the armed forces. In a television interview last month, the Iraqi Kurdish leader Massud Barzani said that ISIS ""is not defeated and will not be ended easily"". ""ISIS was on the ground, now they are underground,"" Mr Barzani said, noting that they had returned to many areas they had been driven out of even stronger than before. An ISIS fighter in Syria, who spoke to The New York Times via WhatsApp, echoed Mr Barzani's grim message. ""Do you think the Americans can defeat the caliphate?"" said the fighter, who identified himself only as Yehya. ""It's a war of attrition. When the coalition stops the air strikes, we will return immediately."" ""We didn't leave for good. We're still in Syria, even in the areas that you think we left. We still have our suicide bombers ready to attack. Our informers are active,"" he said. Prof Hoffman agreed that the US and Russia are locked in a war of attrition against the Islamists, ""and frankly we're losing it. There are nearly a quarter of a million salafi-jihadi fighters all around the world"". That is four times the number of extremists there were in 2001, when Al-Qaeda triggered the global ""war on terror"" with its jetliner suicide attacks on the US. Prof Hoffman said that while military operations may have held them at bay, Islamic State operatives ""carry within their own DNA the seeds to constantly regenerate, to continue to attract, recruit"". ""Who would have thought in the immediate aftermath of Sept 11 that 17 years later, we would still be fighting?"" he said."
Ten suspected suicide attack plotters to appear in Indian court,"NEW DELHI, Dec 27 — Ten people suspected of planning imminent suicide attacks in the New Delhi region will appear in court in the capital today, India's federal counter-terrorism agency said. Members of the three-month old cell, which police said had links to an Islamic State-inspired group, were arrested in raids in Delhi and nearby cities yesterday, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) said. They have yet to be charged. It was not immediately clear whether the accused would be represented in court. The agency said it had recovered about 25 kg of explosives material, such as potassium nitrate and ammonium nitrate, as well as 12 pistols, a home-made rocket launcher and Islamic State-related literature. According to media reports, the interior ministry had written to state authorities in June about an all-time high threat to Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of the next general election, which must be held by May. The NIA said the main suspect arrested, a Muslim cleric, and his associates had procured weapons and explosive material to produce bombs and planned to carry out attacks at crowded places in and around Delhi. The Muslim cleric, 29, was working at a madrasa at Amroha, a town in the state of Uttar Pradesh. The accused include three Delhi students, three shopkeepers and an auto rickshaw driver. “The module was planning to strike very soon. Likely targets included vital installations, security establishments, important persons and crowded places,” NIA spokesman Alok Mittal told reporters."
 Iran arrests 10 over suicide attack on police,"TEHRAN, Dec 9 — Iranian police said today that 10 people had been arrested in connection with a suicide attack in southeastern Iran that killed two police officers. Jihadist separatist group Ansar al-Furqan has claimed responsibility for Thursday's assault in which an explosives-laden car was driven into a police station in the port city of Chabahar. The authorities have rejected the claim of responsibility for the attack, relatively rare in Iran, which also injured around 40 people. Police chief Hossein Ashtari said 10 people had been arrested, according to the conservative Fars news agency, without giving any details. Ansar al-Furqan released a photo of the alleged suicide bomber on Saturday, identified as Abdullah Aziz, according to the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadist activities. Sistan-Baluchistan province has faced decades-long insurgencies by Pakistan-based Baluchi separatists and Sunni Muslim extremists. Iran has blamed the United States and Tehran's regional rivals, Saudi Arabia and Israel, for supporting the insurgent groups."
DFA warns Filipinos to stay vigilant after Libya suicide bomb attack,"The Philippine government has advised Filipinos in Tripoli to remain vigilant and avoid unnecessary movement following a suicide bomb attack at the Libyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday. The advisory was issued on Tuesday following the attack that left three people dead and seven others injured. According to Philippine Embassy Chargé d’Affaires Mardomel Melicor, three suicide bombers were involved in the attack that took place at around 10:30 a.m. (4:30 p.m. Manila time). Melicor said no Filipino has been reported to be among the casualties. The Embassy official advised the more than 2,000 Filipinos and their dependents in the Libyan capital to restrict their movement and stay indoors in the meantime."
 Catholic prelate asks Filipino in Libya to be safe following bomb attack," A Catholic prelate asked overseas Filipino workers in Libya to always think of their safety following a suicide bomb attack there. “They must think first and foremost of their safety,” Balanga bishop Ruperto Santos, chairman of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines Episcopal Commission on Migrants and Itinerant People, said in an interview. He also asked the OFWs there to heed the call of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Philippine Embassy to be vigilant. “With dangerous situations and uncertain times in Libya, our OFWs must always listen and follow the instructions of our Philippine Embassy officials,” said Santos. The CBCP ECMI official asked the government to assist OFWs there. “Those willing to be repatriated, our government must assist and help,” Santos said. The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on Tuesday advised Filipinos in Tripoli to remain vigilant and avoid unnecessary movement. The advisory was issued in the aftermath of the suicide bomb attack at the Libyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs that reportedly left at least three persons dead and seven others injured. Although no Filipino has been reported to be among the casualties, Philippine Embassy Chargé d’Affaires Mardomel Melicor advised the more than 2,000 Filipinos and their dependents in the Libyan capital to restrict their movement and stay indoors for the time being. It was in September when the DFA raised Alert Level 3 in Libya due to the escalation of violence there. Under an Alert Level 3 from the DFA, an automatic deployment ban is imposed by the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration."
Death toll in suicide attack rises to 43 in one of the deadliest attacks in Kabul this year," KABUL (AFP) - An hours-long gun and suicide attack on a Kabul government compound killed at least 43 people, the health ministry said Tuesday (Dec 25), making it one of the deadliest assaults on the Afghan capital this year. Another 10 were wounded in Monday's raid on a site where the Ministry of Public Works and other offices are located, spokesman Waheed Majroh said. Gunmen stormed the compound mid-afternoon after detonating a car bomb at the entrance, sending terrifying government workers running for their lives. Some jumped from the windows. Hundreds more were trapped inside buildings as security forces swarmed the area, engaging in a fierce gun battle with the attackers. It was the deadliest attack in the Afghan capital since a suicide bomber blew himself up in the middle of a religious gathering last month, killing at least 55 people."
Gunmen kill at least 28 in raid on Afghan government building,"KABUL (REUTERS) – Gunmen who raided a government building in the Afghan capital killed at least 28 people - mostly government employees – and wounded more than 20 others in a seven-hour standoff with police that ended on Monday (Dec 24) night, Afghan authorities said. Others killed included a policeman and three of the attackers who were shot dead by Afghan security forces, Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danish said. The attack began in the afternoon when a suicide bomber blew himself up in a car outside the public works ministry. Militants then stormed the building of the National Authority for Disabled People and Martyrs’ Families, taking civilians hostage as they fought a gun battle against Afghan soldiers. Afghan security forces went from floor to floor of the building in an operation to rescue over 350 people inside, but had to exercise restraint in their operations against the attackers given the number of employees there, a senior security official said. No militant group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.  Ambulances raced to the scene during a lull in the shooting, a witness who lives nearby told Reuters. At least 20 people wounded in the clashes were taken to hospital. An official working in another government building close by said employees had locked themselves in their offices after hearing the explosions and gunfire. During the standoff, the building’s second floor caught fire, local news channels reported. Attacks on government offices are frequent and are generally carried out by the Islamist Taliban, who are fighting to expel foreign forces from strategic provinces, topple the Western-backed government and restore their version of hardline Islamic law. The 17-year-old war with the Taliban has seen both fighting and diplomacy intensify in recent months. On Thursday, an official said US President Donald Trump was planning to withdraw at least 5,000 of the 14,000 US troops in Afghanistan, a day after Trump unexpectedly announced that US troops in Syria would be withdrawn. The United States went to war in Afghanistan in 2001 in the wake of the Sept 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, seeking to oust the Taliban militants harbouring Saudi-raised militant Osama bin Laden, who led plans to carry out the attacks. At present, American troops make up the bulk of the Resolute Support mission to train and advise Afghan forces fighting the Taliban and the Islamic State militant group. Others are part of a US-led counter-terrorism mission. The prospect of a US drawdown has triggered widespread uncertainty in war-torn Afghanistan.  With security deteriorating, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Sunday replaced his defence and interior ministers with two uncompromising opponents of the Taliban."
 At least 13 killed in Mogadishu car bomb claimed by al Shabaab," MOGADISHU, Dec 22 —At least 13 people were killed and 17 wounded in a car bomb attack claimed by al Qaeda-linked group al Shabaab close to the president's residence in the Somali capital Mogadishu, police said on today. A second explosion followed nearby. Al Shabaab, in comments broadcast on its Radio Andalus, claimed responsibility for both blasts and said the second was also a car bomb. ""The death toll has risen to 13 people including civilians and soldiers. Seventeen others were injured. The casualties are from the two blasts,"" Major Mohamed Hussein, a police officer, told Reuters. Among those killed were a journalist, two security personnel and a driver working for local station Universal TV, whose car was passing the checkpoint at which the first blast went off, another reporter working for the station said. ""My colleague Awil Dahir Salad died in the blast together with the driver and two security guards. They were killed by the first blast as they drove. May Allah rest their souls,"" journalist Abdiasis Ibrahim who works for Universal TV, told Reuters. Police had earlier said the first car bomb at the checkpoint killed five, mostly soldiers. A Reuters witness at the scene of the second blast said he saw at least two bodies. Ahmed Abdi, another police officer, said the first car bomb exploded at a checkpoint some 400 metres from the president's residence. Al Shabaab carries out frequent attacks in Mogadishu. Its members want to dislodge the government and impose its rule based on its own strict interpretation of Islam's sharia law. The group was forced from Mogadishu in 2011 but maintains a foothold in some regions. It has killed thousands of Somalis and hundreds of civilians across East Africa in a decade-long insurgency."
Four killed in attack on Afghan security forces in Kabul,"KABUL, Dec 11 — At least four people were killed and another six injured after a suicide bomber targeted a convoy of security forces in Kabul early today, officials said, in the latest bloody Taliban-claimed attack in the Afghan capital. The blast took place in Paghman district in western Kabul as the convoy was returning from an overnight operation, interior ministry spokesman Najib Danish told AFP. “It is still not clear whether the attacker was on foot or driving a vehicle,” the spokesman added. Another security official requesting anonymity said the assailant had used a car bomb to target the convoy. Attacks on Afghan forces by the Taliban and the Islamic State group have been inflicting record-high casualties on security personnel this year. Afghan security forces, beset by killings and desertions, have been struggling to beat back insurgents since US-led Nato mostly left them on their own three years ago. In November President Ashraf Ghani said nearly 30,000 Afghan soldiers and police officers have been killed since 2015 — a figure far higher than anything previously acknowledged. Earlier this month, Lieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie — who has been nominated to lead the US military's Central Command — said the death rate among Afghan forces will no longer be sustainable unless urgent measures are taken to address recruiting and training issues. The early morning attack in Kabul came just hours after an overnight assault on a checkpoint in Arghistan district of southern Kandahar province by Taliban fighters killed at least eight Afghan police officers according to the provincial media office. “The fighting lasted several hours, eleven Taliban were also killed,” the office added. The uptick in violence comes as Washington continues to press for a negotiated end to the 17-year conflict. US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad — who is currently canvassing the region to rustle up support for potential peace talks — expressed hopes that a deal to end the war could be struck before the Afghan presidential election scheduled for April."
IS claims attack on Libya foreign ministry," TRIPOLI, Dec 26 — Suicide attackers stormed the Libyan foreign ministry in the capital Tripoli yesterday, killing at least three people including a senior civil servant in an attack claimed by the Islamic State jihadist group. Twenty-one other people were wounded in the attack, authorities said. A car bomb exploded near the ministry, prompting security forces to rush to the scene, said special forces spokesman Tarak al-Dawass. A suicide bomber then blew himself up on the second floor of the building while a second attacker died when a suitcase he was carrying exploded, he said. A third assailant, who was unarmed and wearing a bulletproof vest, was killed by security forces outside, Dawass added. At least three people were killed and 21 wounded, according to the health ministry. Foreign Minister Tahar Siala said one of the dead was senior diplomat Ibrahim al-Shaibi who headed a department in his ministry. Plumes of smoke were seen rising from the building as ambulances, paramedics and security forces gathered outside. IS claimed the attack in a statement distributed on social media, saying that it was carried out by three “soldiers of the caliphate” who were armed with suicide belts and automatic weapons. Interior Minister Fathi Bash Agha admitted during a news conference that “security chaos” reigned in Libya and was “out of our control”. He said this was creating a “fertile ground” for IS to operate in the North African country. Torn apart by power struggles and undermined by chronic insecurity, Libya has become a haven for jihadists since the ouster and killing of Moamer Kadhafi in 2011. Two competing administrations, rival militias, tribes and jihadists have been vying for control of territory and the country's vast oil wealth. IS took advantage of the chaos to gain a foothold in the coastal city of Sirte in 2015. Forces loyal to the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) regained control of Sirte in December 2016 after eight months of deadly fighting. Since then, some jihadists have returned to the desert in an attempt to regroup and reorganise. The interior minister said his department lacked the equipment necessary to restore law and order in Libya. Bach Agha said he found “zero weapons and zero vehicles” in the ministry’s warehouses when he took up his job in October. “Weakness and a security breakdown” allowed assailants to attack the foreign ministry, he said. The foreign minister said the UN should lift an arms embargo it has imposed on Libya since the 2011 uprising. “Stability cannot be restored... without a partial lifting of the embargo. It is needed to guarantee security and combat terrorism,” Siala told reporters. The head of the UN mission in Libya (UNSMIL) denounced the “cowardly terrorist attack” in a statement. Ghassan Salame also pledged to work with Libyan people “to prevent terrorist groups from turning Libya into a haven... for their crimes”. Frank Baker, Britain’s ambassador to Libya, also denounced an “appalling terrorist attack” and tweeted his condolences to the families of the victims. Italian Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero Milanesi joined the chorus of condemnation in a statement reiterating Rome’s “solidarity with the Libyan people and their just aspiration to real security”. In September, IS claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on the headquarters of Libya’s National Oil Company in the heart of Tripoli which left two dead and 10 wounded. Four months earlier, it claimed an attack on the electoral commission’s headquarters which left 14 dead. In April, the GNA launched an operation to track down IS fighters operating in areas of western Libya under its control. Last month IS claimed responsibility for an attack on militia forces in southeastern Libya in which at least nine people were killed. The US military has regularly carried out strikes on jihadists in Libya, particularly south of Sirte. The GNA was set up under a 2015 UN-brokered deal, but a rival administration based in the country’s east aligned with military strongman Khalifa Haftar refuses to recognise its authority. Rival Libyan leaders had agreed to a Paris-brokered deal in May to hold a nationwide election by the end of the year. But instability, territorial disputes and divisions have delayed plans for elections."
43 killed in Kabul govt compound attack,"Kabul ?An hours-long gun and suicide attack on a Kabul government compound killed at least 43 people, the health ministry said Tuesday, making it one of the deadliest assaults on the Afghan capital this year. No militant group has claimed responsibility for the raid, which caps a bloody year for Afghanistan as long-suffering civilians and security forces are slaughtered in record numbers. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid told AFP the attack had “nothing to do with the militants”. Another 25 people were wounded in Monday’s massacre on a site where the Ministry of Public Works and an office that handles pensions and benefits for war veterans are located, spokesman Waheed Majroh said. Gunmen stormed the compound mid-afternoon after detonating a car bomb at the main entrance—opposite residential apartment buildings—sending terrified people running for their lives. Some jumped from windows several floors high to escape the militants. The suicide blast appears to have been a decoy, according to witnesses who told AFP they saw several militants enter the compound through a back gate. Hundreds were trapped inside the compound for hours as heavily armed security forces swarmed the area, engaging the attackers in a fierce gun battle punctuated by multiple explosions. At least four militants, including the bomber, were killed and more than 350 people freed, officials said. Most of the dead and wounded were civilians, who have borne the brunt of the 17-year war. It was the deadliest assault in the Afghan capital since a suicide bomber blew himself up in the middle of a religious gathering last month, killing at least 55 people. President Ashraf Ghani, whose government has been skewered over its security failures, said “terrorists attack civilian targets to hide their defeat on the battleground”. Afghanistan’s de facto prime minister Abdullah Abdullah also sounded a defiant note as he blamed the Taliban for the attack.“Every attack they carry out against our people, our resolve is further strengthened to eliminate them,” he said. But their statements belie the grim reality on the battlefield where the Taliban have the upper hand. Afghanistan’s largest militant group has made significant territorial gains this year as its fighters inflict record casualties on government forces. The raid followed a tumultuous few days in Afghanistan where officials are reeling from US President Donald Trump’s plan to slash troop numbers, which many fear could harm efforts to end the conflict with the Taliban. It also comes after a major security shake-up in Kabul that has placed staunch anti-Taliban and Pakistan veterans in charge of the police and military. While there has been no official announcement of a US drawdown, the mere suggestion of the United States reducing its military presence has rattled the Afghan capital and potentially undermined peace efforts. General Scott Miller, the top US and NATO commander in Afghanistan, said Sunday he had not received orders to pull forces out of the country. Trump’s decision apparently came Tuesday as US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad met with the Taliban in Abu Dhabi, part of efforts to bring the militants to the negotiating table with Kabul. Many Afghans are worried that Ghani’s fragile unity government would collapse if US troops pulled out, enabling the Taliban to sweep back into power and potentially sparking another bloody civil war."
Terror attacker was ‘inspired by Islamic State,"Sydney?A Somali-born Australian who went on a deadly knife rampage in the country’s second-largest city of Melbourne was inspired by Islamic State but did not have a direct link to the jihadist group, the government said Sunday. Hassan Khalif Shire Ali stabbed to death well-known local cafe co-owner Sisto Malaspina and injured two other men in Bourke Street in the heart of Melbourne on Friday afternoon before he was shot and killed by police. The 30-year-old had gone to the bustling city in a utility vehicle filled with gas cylinders before setting it alight. Islamic State said via its propaganda arm that Shire Ali was an “Islamic State fighter and carried out the operation”, but provided no evidence to back its claim. “In relation to his connections with ISIL (another name for IS) or with any terrorist group... there’s not, as I’m advised, a membership of an organization or a definite link to ISIL,” Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton told reporters in Brisbane. “The working theory is at the moment a case where this person has been downloading information or receiving messages in his own mind about what he should be doing. It’s inspired as opposed to affiliation or membership.” Shire Ali, known to the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO), had his passport revoked in 2015 on fears he was trying to travel to Syria to join IS. But he was also assessed by authorities as not being a domestic threat. Dutton defended the actions of ASIO, saying they had more than 400 investigations and people of interest to monitor.“Police did not have intelligence in relation to this person that he was about to commit an act,” he added. “The fact is that many people, particularly where there is a low level of sophistication, where you have someone who can grab a knife from a kitchen drawer... it is impossible for authorities to cover every one of those circumstances.” Dutton’s comments came as Melbourne’s Herald Sun reported Sunday that Shire Ali had drug and alcohol problems, and had split from his wife and become distanced from his family. Melbourne’s The Age raised questions about his mental health, quoting a local imam as saying Shire Ali told him he was being “chased by unseen people with spears”. Meanwhile more than Aus$50,000 (US$36,000) has been raised on GoFundMe for a bystander dubbed “trolley man”, who was hailed as a hero for trying to stop Shire Ali by knocking him over with a shopping cart. The man, named in local media as Michael Rogers, is homeless according to the GoFundMe page creators. Authorities say more than a dozen terrorist attacks have been prevented in recent years, but several have taken place, including a cafe siege in Sydney in 2014 where two hostages were killed. Shire Ali’s brother will go on trial next year on separate terror-related charges?accused of trying to acquire a firearm and kill people in a New Years’ Eve crowd."

Grandma devastated by ISIS video showing boy coached to kill Australians,"SYDNEY (AFP) - The devastated grandmother of a young boy filmed being coached to kill Australians has lashed out at his notorious ISIS fighter father for using him as a ""media tool"". Footage surfaced in Australia on Sunday (April 30) of Australian Khaled Sharrouf grilling his six-year-old son Hamze in Syria about how to murder non-Muslims. It reportedly showed the boy holding guns and a knife and making threats as a voice off-camera asked him: ""How do you kill an Australian?"" Sharrouf, the first Australian to be stripped of his citizenship under anti-terrorism laws, made international headlines in 2014 when he posted an image on Twitter of another son holding a severed head. The children's grandmother Karen Nettleton, whose daughter left Australia for Syria in 2013 with her young family to join Sharrouf but has since reportedly died, said she was disgusted to see the latest images. ""Everybody out there is going to see it and think he's a little terrorist. I don't know how his father could have done it to him. I really don't understand that,"" she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Monday evening. ""He (Hamze) was the baby out of all of them. I rocked him to sleep, I sang him songs, I took him swimming. ""It kills me because I know he's just a six-year-old little boy. I know what's he's like. He's just being used, I think as some sort of media tool."" Nettleton has been fighting for three years to bring her five grandchildren - three boys and two girls - back to Australia, and insisted they were not lost to Islamic State. ""They're not lost, they're not gone. They're just kids, with the right help they will be OK,"" she said. The ABC said the video had been made by Sharrouf, once thought killed in a drone strike, with the aim of selling it to Australian media, but there were no takers. It was accompanied by a photo which showed the boy in front of a strung-up corpse of a man in an orange jumpsuit with a poster round his neck saying he was a traitor, the broadcaster added. Justice Minister Michael Keenan slammed the ""appalling"" use of a child in extremist propaganda. ""The Australian government condemns this truly appalling act of using a child to espouse ISIL's terrorist messaging,"" he said at the weekend, referring to the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Canberra lifted its terror threat alert level in September 2014 and introduced new national security laws amid concerns of attacks by individuals inspired by organisations such as ISIS. It also cracked down on Australians attempting to travel to conflict zones including Syria and Iraq."
Libya strikes kill more than 80 ISIS fighters,"LIBYA (REUTERS) - US military strikes in Libya on Wednesday night (Jan 18) have killed more than 80 fighters from the Islamic State, some of whom were believed to be actively plotting attacks in Europe, US Defense Secretary Ash Carter said on Thursday (Jan 19). “We need to strike ISIL everywhere they show up. And that's particularly true in view of the fact that we know some of the ISIL operatives in Libya were involved with plotting attacks,” Carter said. A Pentagon spokesman said an initial assessment indicated the US military strikes destroyed two camps southwest of Sirte, Libya. Libyan forces backed by US airstrikes finished clearing the last Islamic State holdout in Sirte last month after a battle of nearly seven months for the militant group's former North African stronghold. The US also carried out about 470 air strikes against Islamic State targets in Sirte during that campaign. The loss of Sirte was a major blow for Islamic State, leaving the group without any territory in Libya, although it retains an active presence in parts of the vast country. The jihadist group took over Sirte in early 2015, turning it into its most important base outside the Middle East and attracting large numbers of foreign fighters into the city. It imposed its ultra-hardline rule on residents, and extended its control along about 250km of Libya's Mediterranean coastline. Since Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown in 2011 by rebel forces backed by NATO air strikes, Libya has slipped deeper into chaos."
From caliph to fugitive: ISIS leader Baghdadi on the run,"BAGHDAD/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is on the brink of losing the two main centres of his 'caliphate' but even though he is on the run, it may take years to capture or kill him, officials and experts said. ISIS fighters are close to defeat in the twin capitals of the group's territory, Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria, and officials say Baghdadi is steering clear of both, hiding in thousands of square kilometres of desert between the two. ""In the end, he will either be killed or captured, he will not be able to remain underground forever,"" said Lahur Talabany, the head of counter-terrorism at the Kurdistan Regional Government, the Kurdish autonomous region in northern Iraq. ""But this is a few years away still,"" he told Reuters. One of Baghdadi's main concerns is to ensure those around him do not betray him for the US$25 million (S$34.60) reward offered by the United States to bring him ""to justice"", said Hisham al-Hashimi, who advises Middle East governments on ISIS affairs. ""With no land to rule openly, he can no longer claim the title caliph,"" Hashimi said. ""He is a man on the run and the number of his supporters is shrinking as they lose territory."" Iraqi forces have retaken much of Mosul, the northern Iraqi city the hardline group seized in June 2014 and from which Baghdadi declared himself ""caliph"" or leader of all Muslims shortly afterwards. Raqqa, his capital in Syria, is nearly surrounded by a coalition of Syrian Kurdish and Arab groups. The last public video footage of him shows him dressed in black clerical robes declaring his caliphate from the pulpit of Mosul's medieval Grand al-Nuri mosque back in 2014. Born Ibrahim al-Samarrai, Baghdadi is a 46-year-old Iraqi who broke away from Al-Qaeda in 2013, two years after the capture and killing of the group's leader Osama bin Laden. He grew up in a religious family, studied Islamic theology in Baghdad and joined the Salaafi Islamist insurgency in 2003, the year of the US-led invasion of Iraq. He was caught by the Americans who released him about a year later as they considered him then as a civilian rather than a military target. He is shy and reserved, Hashimi said, and has recently stuck to the sparsely populated Iraq-Syria border where drones and strangers are easy to spot. The US Department of State's Counter-Terrorism Rewards Programme had put the same US$25 million bounty on Bin Laden and Iraqi former president Saddam Hussein and the reward is still available for Bin Laden's successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Neither Saddam nor Bin Laden were voluntarily betrayed, but the bounties complicated their movements and communications. ""The reward creates worry and tension, it restricts his movements and limit the number of his guards,"" said Fadhel Abu Ragheef, a Baghdad-based expert on extremist groups. ""He doesn't stay more than 72 hours in any one place."" Baghdadi ""has become nervous and very careful in his movements"", said Talabany, whose services are directly involved in countering ISIS plots. ""His circle of trust has become even smaller."" His last recorded speech was issued in early November, two weeks after the start of the Mosul battle, when he urged his followers to fight the ""unbelievers"" and ""make their blood flow as rivers"". US and Iraqi officials believe he has left operational commanders behind with diehard followers to fight the battles of Mosul and Raqqa, to focus on his own survival. It is not possible to confirm his whereabouts. Baghdadi does not use phones and has a handful number of approved couriers to communicate with his two main aides, Iyad al-Obaidi, his defence minister, and Ayad al-Jumaili, in charge of security. There was no confirmation of an April 1 Iraqi state TV report that Jumaili had been killed. Baghdadi moves in ordinary cars, or the kind of pick-up trucks used by farmers, between hideouts on both sides of the Iraqi-Syrian border, with just a driver and two bodyguards, said Hashimi. The region is well known to his men as the hotbed of the Sunni insurgency against US forces that invaded Iraq and later the Shi'ite-led governments that took over the country. At the height of its power two years ago, ISIS ruled over millions of people in territory running from northern Syria through towns and villages along the Tigris and Euphrates river valleys to the outskirts of the Iraqi capital Baghdad. It persecuted non-Sunnis and even Sunnis who did not agree with its extreme version of Islamic law, with public executions and whippings for violating strict controls on appearance, behaviour and movement. But the group has been retreating since in the face of a multitude of local, regional and international forces, driven into action by the scores of deadly attacks around the world that it has claimed or inspired. A few hundred thousand people now live in the areas under the group's control, in and around Raqqa and Deir Ezzor, in Syria's east, and in a few pockets south and west of Mosul. Hashimi said ISIS was moving some fighters out of Raqqa before it was encircled to regroup in Deir Ezzor. Mosul, with pre-war population of 2 million, was at least four times the size of any other the group has held. Up to 200,000 people are still trapped in the Old City, ISIS' besieged enclave in Mosul, lacking supplies and being used as human shields to obstruct the progress of Iraqi forces by a US-led international coalition. The Syrian Democratic Forces, made of Kurdish and Arab groups supported by the US-led coalition, began to attack Raqqa last week, after a months-long campaign to cut it off. The militants are also fighting Russian and Iranian-backed forces in Syria loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, and mainly Sunni Muslim Syrian rebels backed by Turkey. The last official report about Baghdadi was from the Iraqi military on Feb 13. Iraqi F-16s carried out a strike on a house where he was thought to be meeting other commanders, in western Iraq, near the Syrian border, it said. Overall, ISIS has 8,000 fighters left, of which 2,000 are foreigners from other Arab states, Europe, Russia and central Asia, said Abu Ragheef. ""A small number compared to the tens of thousands arrayed against them in both countries, but a force to be reckoned with, made up of die-hards with nothing to lose, hiding in the middle of civilians and making extensive use of booby traps, mines and explosives,"" he said. The US government has a joint task force to track down Baghdadi which includes special operations forces, the CIA and other US intelligence agencies, as well as spy satellites of the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. It will take more than that to erase his influence, Talabany said. ""He is still considered the leader of ISIL and many continue to fight for him; that hasn't changed drastically,"" he said, using an alternate ISIS acronym. Even if killed or captured, he added, ""his legacy and that of ISIL will endure unless radical extremism is tackled."""
Fighters on Raqqa front line brace for final showdown with Islamic State,"RAQQA (Syria), Oct 10 — In the gutted four-storey building that he and five other US-backed fighters have turned into a frontline fortress, Babel can peer out at Islamic State positions just 150m away. The jihadist militants expected to make a last stand for this stronghold of their self-proclaimed caliphate are cornered and desperate here in Raqqa, the city on the Euphrates river that has served as their de-facto Syrian capital since 2014. “Let Daesh come — we’re ready for them. We have explosives to drop downstairs,” said Babel, which is his nom de guerre. He and his fellow members of the US-backed Syrian Defence Forces have occupied the frontline building for three weeks and are now preparing for a final showdown with Islamic State, the group also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh. The SDF fighters’ position is well prepared in case the cornered IS militants attempt an attack. The front porch steps have been demolished, leaving a drop to the basement that can be crossed only by climbing a section of iron fence - a makeshift ladder, which the defenders can pull up. Inside, plastic bottles have been strewn across the floor to squeak when stepped on and alert them to intruders. After months of intense fighting and heavy US bombardment, the SDF have surrounded Islamic State militants in a small part of the city. As the Kurdish and Arab militias of the SDF close in and US-led air raids increase, they expect fierce fighting to mark the final stages of the campaign. “Daesh regularly launch small raids, even behind our position. Yesterday they attacked the building opposite and tried to push towards us. We killed a few and they retreated to the hospital,” Babel said. SDF units have a clear view over the Raqqa hospital, one of Islamic State’s last strongholds in the city, from a line of buildings they occupy to its northwest. Apartment blocks between them and the hospital have been flattened by air strikes. Commanders say the hospital and a nearby stadium, where the jihadists are said to be holding civilian hostages, will be where they make their last stand. Babel’s unit are holding the front line ahead of an anticipated final push, firing at militants whenever they can spot them. “The last few nights they’ve been shining spotlights from the hospital towards our lines, so we can’t really see,” he said. Another fighter in the unit said sniper fire from Islamic State had recently reduced, possibly as a means of conserving ammunition for more intense fighting to come. An SDF field commander said on Sunday assaults were to begin soon as part of a final push against Islamic State, focused initially on surrounding the stadium. The hospital is already encircled. “Daesh is amassing, preparing to fight. This is the last stage, so they’ll resist and then surrender or die,” the commander who gave his name as Ardal Raqqa said. US coalition spokesman Ryan Dillon was more cautious about calling the current stage of the offensive a final assault. “Whether this is the final assault or an assault, I won’t characterise it either way,” Dillon said by phone. The fight was “concentrated around the complex which was the national hospital and the stadium,” he said. The SDF predicted ahead of a major push in June that it could take just weeks to drive Islamic State out of Raqqa. That has proven overly optimistic, with the militants holding out for months so far. Their use of civilians for cover, tunnels to launch counter attacks, snipers and countless booby traps have slowed SDF advances. “Many are being wounded, especially by snipers. Daesh snipers often shoot to wound, not to kill, so they can target whoever comes to save an injured comrade,” Babel said. One shaken SDF fighter in a nearby base last week showed cuts on his face from where a sniper bullet had ricocheted. Both the US spokesman Dillon and the SDF fighter Babel said that some Islamic State fighters were surrendering. “The other day a Saudi fighter escaped and handed himself over. The guys who surrender usually have families,” Babel said. Interrogations of surrendering militants revealed IS had dug a tunnel between the hospital and stadium, he said. Dillon said several IS militants and leaders had surrendered in recent weeks. “It is a growing trend,” he said. At the front line, SDF fighters said morale was high. One fighter belted pop music to other units over his walkie talkie. “Hopefully we’ll be done soon,” Babel said."
"ISIS fighters, having pledged to fight or die, surrender en masse","DIBIS, Iraq — The prisoners were taken to a waiting room in groups of four, and were told to stand facing the concrete wall, their noses almost touching it, their hands bound behind their backs. More than 1,000 prisoners determined to be Islamic State fighters passed through that room last week after they fled their crumbling Iraqi stronghold of Hawija. Instead of the martyrdom they had boasted was their only acceptable fate, they had voluntarily ended up here in the interrogation centre of the Kurdish authorities in northern Iraq. For an extremist group that has made its reputation on its ferociousness, with fighters who would always choose suicide over surrender, the fall of Hawija has been a notable turning point. The group has suffered a string of humiliating defeats in Iraq and Syria, but the number of its shock troops who turned themselves in at the centre in Dibis was unusually large, more than 1,000 since last Sunday, according to Kurdish intelligence officials. The fight for Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, took nine months, and by comparison, relatively few Islamic State fighters surrendered. Tal Afar fell next, and more quickly, in only 11 days. Some 500 fighters surrendered there. ADVERTISEMENT The Iraqi military ousted the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL, from Hawija in 15 days, saying it had taken its forces only three days of actual heavy fighting before most of the extremists grabbed their families and ran. According to Kurdish officials, they put up no fight at all, other than planting bombs and booby traps. Seen up close, the fighters' pretence of bravado soon disappears. Their shoes were taken from them, their pockets emptied and their belts discarded, and, as they stood facing the wall, the backs of their dishdashas were stained with the evidence that some of them had not been to a toilet in days. One of the men smelled so bad that when he was taken into the small interrogation room, those inside were startled. He filled the doorway, appearing even larger than his actual size. The interrogator unbuckled his hip holster, resting his right hand on his pistol. Everyone in the room seemed scared of the man, even though his hands were tied behind his back. His thick black hair was Medusa-wild and shoulder-length, though his handsome face had only a wisp of black stubble on the chin. ""Hello,"" a visitor said. ""Where's your beard?"" The Islamic State requires all men to grow full beards. ""I'm only 21, I can't grow it yet,"" he said, clearly embarrassed. Kurdish interrogators allowed a dozen of the surrendered fighters to be interviewed by a reporter as they arrived at the local headquarters of the Asayish, the Kurdish intelligence service, in the town of Dibis, near the Kurds' front lines opposite Hawija. Officers monitored all interviews. Many of the fighters claimed to have been just cooks or clerks. So many said they had been members of the Islamic State for only a month or two that interrogators suspected they had been coached to say that. Gone was the contempt for the world's opinion, spewed out in one violent video after another — many of them made in Hawija, where grisly killings, especially of Kurdish prisoners, were the norm during their three-year reign over that Sunni Arab city in northern Iraq. Most of the prisoners, though, claimed to have never seen a beheading, or even heard of such a thing. At first, the beardless fighter seemed an exception, admitting defiantly that he had been fighting for the group for two years, alongside family members. He readily gave his name: ""Maytham Muhammed Mohemin,"" he said, practically spitting it out. His hands were bound behind his back and he was effectively sitting on them, forced back into a red plastic lawn chair, yet the three Kurdish officers in the room kept more than an arm's length away in case he lunged for their weapons. During the interview, he grew nervous. He said he was from Hawija and had joined the Islamic State because he believed in its cause, because his elder brother had, and because the $100 a month pay was better than anything else around. He had arrived in Dibis on Thursday (Oct 5) afternoon with eight companions, seven Iraqis and an Egyptian, after they dropped their weapons in Hawija that morning. Since the beginning of the Iraqi offensive two weeks earlier, they had spent most of the time burrowed in foxholes to escape the relentless US bombing and shelling by advancing Iraqi forces, and had passed days without sanitary facilities or food. Finally, the Islamic State wali, or governor of Hawija, told the men to turn themselves in to the Kurdish forces, known as the peshmerga, and to flee the advancing Iraqi army and its Shiite militia allies, the Iranian-trained Hashed al-Shaabi, notorious for killing not only Islamic State prisoners but also their entire families. ""The governor told us each to ""solve your own problem and find your own solution for yourself,'"" Mohemin said. ""He said, *Go to the peshmerga, not to the Hashed.'"" Mohemin denied ever attending a beheading but later, prompted by an Asayish intelligence officer, he admitted going to one, he said, because he had been ordered to. ""I was scared,"" he said. ""I never saw anything like that in my life."" His prospects are grim. His pregnant wife had fled to Dibis a week before him, but it was unlikely he would see her or their expected child, their first, anytime soon. His elder brother was killed in combat. His father and little brother, one too old to pledge to the Islamic State and the other too young, had disappeared. The interrogator, Lt. Pisthiwan Salahi, said Mohemin was not only an Islamic State soldier but also a member of an elite suicide squad known as the Seekers of Martyrdom, according to informers. If convicted of that affiliation by an Asayish court, his sentence would be long; if he was connected to any killings, possibly lifelong. Mohemin's narrative differed. ""I was just a common soldier,"" he said. ""I never killed a civilian. I wasn't even on the front line."" The lieutenant scoffed at him. ""Well, twice I was on the front line, just for a day, but not against the Kurds,"" Mohemin said. More scoffing. ""Well once against the Kurds, but only shooting from a distance. I couldn't see anyone."" Kurdish officials have been perplexed by the number of fighters who have surrendered. Many of the militants said they were ordered by their leaders to turn themselves in to the Kurds, who were known to take prisoners instead of killing them. But Capt. Ali Muhammed Syan, chief of the Asayish interrogators in Dibis, said even the fighters did not seem to know why their leaders were telling them to quit. ""Maybe it's some deal,"" he said. ""Maybe it's just bad morale, I don't know."" To identify the militants, Kurdish intelligence officers pored over videos from Hawija, such as ones showing peshmerga prisoners in orange jump suits in individual cages on the backs of pickup trucks, being paraded through town to be stoned, then set afire or beheaded in public. Crowds of thousands participated. One by one the Islamic State prisoners were taken out of the waiting room line to be interviewed, each telling pretty much the same story. ""I pledged to ISIS in January 2015 and left in March,"" said Raad Abdullah Ahmad, 31. ""My family disowned me after that. Imagine having no family. I left because I didn't like what they did to people."" Another, Hussein Jamal, 21, said he had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in 2014 but had remained only 45 days. ""Ask him why he didn't come out sooner then,"" one of the interrogators suggested. ""I was afraid,"" Jamal said. ""Ask them why they fled this way,"" another of the interrogators suggested. Both men said that they were certain that the Hashed al-Shaabi militias would kill them, but that the Kurds would not. ""Why not?"" ""They are more civilised than we are,"" Ahmad said. ""They know who is good and who is bad."" Mohemin had shrunk back into his red chair after an hour of talking and looked much smaller than before. When asked if he thought he would see his wife again, or his new child, he said, ""I don't know,"" and looked at the floor. The lieutenant did not take his eyes off him for a second. ""They're just planning to go underground and make sleeper cells,"" he said. Mohemin shook his head. ""This is the end of this state,"" he said. He had wet his trousers, adding to the smell, but did not ask to use a toilet. ""I believe if the governors are telling us to surrender, it really means that this is the end."" He swore to God that he was telling the truth.

 Fil-Am in North Carolina gets life term for plotting mayhem with ISIS," ASHEVILLE, North Carolina — A North Carolina man accused of plotting a U.S. terror attack that he discussed with a member of the Islamic State group received a life sentence on Tuesday, June 27. Justin Sullivan, 21, (a Filipino American) pleaded guilty in November. The Morganton man is also accused of killing his neighbor and stealing his money so he could buy an assault rifle to carry out an IS-inspired shooting at a concert or club. A doctor will observe Sullivan to determine if he’s predisposed to schizophrenia. The defense argued that being placed in a high-security prison could trigger schizophrenia. Prosecutors asked for a determination on the Clarke murder, but the judge only ruled on the acts of terror. The judge said he didn’t need to make a decision on the homicide case because that is the state’s responsibility. Prosecutors say Sullivan spoke with Junaid Hussain in June 2015 via social media about making a video of a terrorist attack in the U.S. to be used by the militant group. Hussain was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Syria in August 2015. Prosecutors said in a statement that Sullivan pleaded guilty to attempting to commit an act of terrorism – planning to kill hundreds of innocent people to prove his allegiance to the terrorist group ISIL. Prosecutors say Sullivan also admitted to regular contact with Junaid Hussain, one of ISIL’s prominent members in Syria, who asked Sullivan to make a video of the deadly attack. “It is frightening to know that the defendant in this case was able to use social media to contact and seek advice from ISIL, a murderous organization,” Rose said. Prosecutors said Sullivan watched violent ISIL attacks on the Internet, including beheadings, expressed support for the group and destroyed religious items that belonged to his parents. His father, retires US Marines Capt. Rich Sullivan, reported his son to the police. The young Sullivan also told an undercover FBI employee that he planned to buy a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle at a gun show and tried buying hollow point ammunition to use with the gun in June 2015."
" US, Australian officials warn of returning foreign fighters","Top US and Australian officials on Monday warned battle-hardened and angry foreign fighters may return to Southeast Asia from the Middle East and take up arms in their own countries. The warning follows this weekend’s terror attacks in London, which were claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group, and amid a growing jihadist threat in the Philippines. In the Philippines, hundreds of civilians are trapped by fighting between the military and Islamist militants who have overrun the city of Marawi on the restive southern region of Mindanao. READ: Fear, confusion as Marawi is devastated by fighting IS fighters will “come back with battlefield skills, they’ll come back with hardened ideology, they’ll come back angry, frustrated, and we need to be very aware of that,” Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne said. She was speaking at the start of an Australia-US ministerial summit also attended by Pentagon chief Jim Mattis, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and his Australian counterpart Julie Bishop. Reacting to the London attacks, Mattis said: “We are united … in our resolve, even against an enemy that thinks by hurting us, they can scare us. Well, we don’t scare.” US President Donald Trump has instructed the Pentagon to “annihilate” IS in a bid to prevent escaped foreign fighters from returning home as they lose ground in Iraq and Syria. The move to encircle then kill as many jihadists in place as possible—rather than letting them exit a city and targeting them as they flee—reflects an increased urgency to stop them bringing their military expertise and ideology back to Western capitals and other areas. Bishop told the Americans that the issue of countering terrorism would be high on the agenda at Monday’s annual talks. “The global terrorist threat is ever evolving, we’ve seen brutal attacks in a number of European cities, we’ve thwarted attacks here in Australia, and so we want to discuss with you the links back into the Middle East,” she said. Australian officials say they have prevented 12 terror attacks on home soil since 2014 with more than 60 people charged. The US and Australian officials were scheduled to hold a press conference later Monday."
G7 demands internet giants crack down on extremist content,"The G7 nations on Friday demanded action from internet providers and social media firms against extremist content online, vowing to step up their fight against terrorism after this week’s Manchester attack. British Prime Minister Theresa May won solidarity from her G7 colleagues at summit talks in Italy after the suicide bombing Monday at a pop concert killed 22 people, including several children. The G7 also vowed a collective effort to track down and prosecute foreign fighters dispersing from conflicts such as Syria, which May said showed the morphing nature of the threat. “We agreed the threat from Daesh is evolving rather than disappearing,” she told a news conference, referring to the Islamic State group, also known by the acronyms of ISIS and ISIL. “As they lose ground in Iraq and Syria, foreign fighters are returning and the group’s hateful ideology is spreading online,” May said. “Make no mistake — the fight is moving from the battlefield to the internet.” May then headed home early from the summit to confront the “critical” threat still facing Britain. The United States, France and Britain’s other partners in the G7 laid out their strategy in a joint statement adopted at the summit in Sicily. They called on internet service providers and social media companies “to substantially increase their efforts to address terrorist content”. “We encourage industry to act urgently in developing and sharing new technology and tools to improve the automatic detection of content promoting incitement to violence, and we commit to supporting industry efforts in this vein including the proposed industry-led forum for combating online extremism,” they said. Elders at the Manchester mosque where the bomber sometimes worshiped suggest that he may have been radicalized online, by accessing content that is freely available from the likes of the Islamic State group. Pressure has been building on social media giants amid accusations they are doing too little, too late to eradicate hate speech and extremist recruitment done on their sites. Three weeks ago, Facebook said it was hiring an extra 3,000 staff to remove violent content such as gruesome killings and suicides broadcast on its video platform. European authorities meanwhile are increasingly concerned about the threat posed by foreign fighters who went to join the Islamic State group but are now dispersing as the jihadists come under pressure on the battlefield. The stepped-up G7 cooperation comes amid fears that the Manchester bomber had been to Syria after visiting his parents’ homeland of Libya. “It is vital we do more to cooperate with our partners in the region to step up returns and prosecutions of foreign fighters,” May said. One prosecution was recently brought against such a fighter in Turkey, and Britain now wants G7 action to help local authorities wage more prosecutions in Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, a British government spokesperson said. “This means improving intelligence-sharing, evidence gathering and bolstering countries’ police and legal processes,” May said. According to a senior British government source, May urged the G7 countries to share police expertise and border security methods with countries where foreign fighters travel through or fight in. Names and nationalities of foreign fighters should be shared to help their identification by different countries as they cross borders. “When our allies find evidence, such as video or papers, of illegal activity involving foreign fighters, for example a Brit in a conflict zone, they should pass that to our authorities. It may help prosecute foreign fighters when they return,” the source said."
 Indonesian police kill four men who attacked Riau HQ,"JAKARTA • Indonesian police shot dead four men after they used samurai swords to attack officers at the Riau provincial police headquarters in the city of Pekanbaru in Sumatra yesterday, days after a wave of deadly suicide bombings in another part of the country. National police spokesman Setyo Wasisto told a briefing that the men had slammed a minivan into a gate at the station before getting out to stage the attack. Inspector-General Setyo said a police officer was killed after one of the perpetrators tried to escape and crashed into him, while two officers were wounded in the attack. ""The one who escaped has been captured and secured at Pekanbaru police station,"" he said. An internal police report said one of the dead men in the Pekanbaru attack had a suspected bomb strapped to his body, although Insp-Gen Setyo did not comment on this. Television images showed what were reportedly the bodies of four suspects lying on the ground. There was a long sword next to one body. A journalist who had been at the police station yesterday was also hurt after being hit by the car. A press conference about a drug bust was under way when the attack took place. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) militant group, which claimed responsibility for the series of recent attacks in East Java province, said it was also behind the Pekanbaru attack, according to the group's Amaq news agency. It offered no evidence in support of the claim. Insp-Gen Setyo said the men belonged to the Islamic State of Indonesia network in Riau, or NII, ""which is part of the ISIS network in Indonesia"". Police said three of the Pekanbaru attackers were Riau residents aged between 26 and 42. Four of the men involved in the attack had previously tried to help terror detainees who were rioting at a maximum-security police lock-up outside Jakarta last week, he said. It was not clear, however, if the four were the same men shot dead by police yesterday. Insp-Gen Setyo said they had travelled from Sumatra to help the rioters, but returned as the situation had been defused. The attack comes as Indonesia has been rocked by deadly attacks on churches and a police station in the city of Surabaya, in East Java province, over the past few days that have left more than 20 people dead, including 13 suspected perpetrators. The multiple suicide bombings were carried out by families who had even included their young children. An explosion also occurred on Sunday at an apartment in neighbouring Sidoarjo regency, where militants were suspected to have been constructing bombs, police said. The attacks were the worst in the world's biggest Muslim-majority country since the bombing of tourist-packed restaurants in Bali in 2005. Police suspect the East Java attacks were carried out by a cell of the Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) militant group. JAD, an umbrella organisation that is believed to have drawn hundreds of Indonesian sympathisers of ISIS, is on a United States State Department terrorist list. Although the NII is separate from the JAD group, Insp-Gen Setyo said they were both part of the wider pro-ISIS network in Indonesia. ""They all pledged allegiance to (ISIS leader) Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,"" he said. Indonesia - which is set to host the Asian Games in three months and an International Monetary Fund-World Bank meeting in Bali in October - has long struggled with Islamist militancy, including the 2002 Bali bombings that killed more than 200 people - mostly foreign tourists - in the country's worst terror attack. After some major successes tackling Islamist militancy since 2001, Indonesia has seen a resurgence in recent years, including in January 2016, when four suicide bombers and gunmen attacked a shopping area in the capital Jakarta. Police have been frequent targets of mostly low-level attacks by local militants, including a suicide bombing at a bus station in Jakarta last year that killed three police officers. This week's bloody violence is putting pressure on lawmakers to pass a stalled security law that would give police more power to take pre-emptive action against people suspected of planning terror attacks. Indonesia's elite anti-terror force Densus 88 has responded with a series of raids in which several suspected militants have been shot dead - including the second-ranking member of the JAD cell in Surabaya. Meanwhile, the police anti-terror squad yesterday arrested three militants on the outskirts of Jakarta. During the arrest, the police seized an ISIS flag and scores of weapons, local media quoted a police official as saying."
Philippine police kill 2 brothers suspected to be members of local ISIS cell,"DAVAO CITY, THE PHILIPPINES (BERNAMA) - Philippine police shot and killed two brothers suspected to be members of a local cell of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terror group in the southern Philippines late on Sunday (Oct 14), the authorities said on Monday. Senior Superintendent Ferlu Silvio, the provincial police chief for Davao del Sur police, identified the slain suspects as Norhan Delangalen Sinapan and his brother, Norton Delangalen Sinapan, according to Xinhua news agency. He said Norhan was the leader of an ISIS cell known as Daulah Islamiyah, based in the city of Digos, in Davao del Sur province. Supt Silvio said the operation against the brothers was carried out by combined police units, who swooped on their hideout at a seaside community at 11pm local time. Seized from the slain suspects were a handgun, several rounds of ammunition, a component for an improvised bomb, a fragmentation grenade and two black flags with ISIS markings, the police official said. The southern Philippines has been on alert following reports that terrorists who swore allegiance to the terror network had regrouped after they were routed and expelled by Philippine troops from Marawi City late last year after five months of heavy fighting. A series of bombings in the southern Philippine town of Isulan in August and September that killed four people and wounded scores of others were blamed on local ISIS-affiliated extremists."
Indonesian police detain three over suspected plot to attack assembly,"JAKARTA, June 3 — Indonesian anti-terrorism police have detained three former students in a raid on a university campus in Pekanbaru, on Sumatra island, and seized crude bombs and other explosive material, police said. The men, who have been named as suspects, are thought to have been planning to attack the local parliament in Pekanbaru, the capital of Riau province, national police spokesman Setyo Wasisto said in a statement. During yesterday’s raid on a faculty at Riau University, police found a pipe bomb, a homemade grenade, as well as the homemade explosive triacetone triperoxide (TATP), known as the “mother of Satan”, Wasisto said. They also seized an air rifle and sets of bows and arrows, as well as other material such as fertiliser that could be used to make bombs, he said. Authorities have highlighted concerns about a rise in radicalism at universities in the world’s biggest Muslim-majority country. A number of recent surveys of students have pointed to significant support for Islamic State, carrying out jihad and the establishment of a caliphate in Indonesia. After some major successes tackling Islamist militancy in the last two decades, there have also been a resurgence of attacks in recent years. Last month, police shot dead four men who used samurai swords to attack officers at police headquarters in Pekanbaru. That attack came soon after a series of suicide bombings by militants targeting churches and a police building in Indonesia’s second-biggest of city of Surabaya. In all, about 30 people were killed in the attacks in Surabaya, including 13 of the suspected suicide bombers. Police say the bombers belonged to cells of the Islamic State-inspired Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), an umbrella organization on a US State Department terrorist list that is reckoned to have drawn hundreds of Indonesian sympathisers."
"UN Security Council condemns ‘heinous, cowardly terrorist attack” in Jolo","Members of the Security Council of the United Nations on Tuesday condemned in the strongest terms what it called “heinous and cowardly terrorist attack” that occurred at Jolo Cathedral in Sulu on January 27. In a statement, the members of the Security Council likewise expressed their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and to the Philippines government and they wished a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured. At least 21 people were killed and dozens of others were wounded when two separate explosions rocked the Our Lady of Carmel Cathedral in Jolo during a Sunday morning mass. “The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security,” they said. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/Da’esh) has claimed responsibility on the Jolo cathedral attack. Moreover, the members of the powerful Security Council underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice, even as they urged all States, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant Security Council resolutions, “to cooperate actively with the Government of the Philippines and all other relevant authorities in this regard.” “The members of the Security Council reiterated that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed,” they added. Similarly, the Security Council members reaffirmed the need for all States to “combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and other obligations under international law, including international human rights law, international refugee law and international humanitarian law, threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts.” The Security Council is one of the UN’s principal organs tasked with the maintenance of international peace and security as well as accepting new members to the United Nations and approving any changes to the international body’s Charter."
Crowds pay tribute to Melbourne terror victim,"MELBOURNE, Nov 10 — Hollywood superstar Russell Crowe led tributes today to “true gentleman” 74-year-old Sisto Malaspina, a doyen of Melbourne’s thriving cafe culture who was stabbed to death in Friday’s rush hour terror attack. As crowds gathered at Malaspina’s “Pellegrini” cafe to lay flowers and tokens of remembrance, Australian acting legend Crowe led a flood of tributes online. “Il mio cuore si spezza” (my heart is broken) he wrote on Twitter in Malaspina’s native Italian. “I’ve been going to Pellegrini’s since 1987. Never been to Melbourne without dropping in on my man Sisto... My sweet loyal friend, stabbed in the street by a mad man.” Melbourne is Australia’s second largest city, a thriving cosmopolitan metropolis of almost five million people famed for its cafes, bars, restaurants and high standard of living. Opposition leader Bill Shorten, who is from the city and has been visiting Malaspina’s cafe since his schoolboy days, described the murder of Melbourne’s adopted son as “shocking, unreal and heartbreaking.” “I just saw Sisto on Monday morning. He insisted I try a slice of his almond cake. He’s a Melbourne icon and a true gentleman.” Two other men wounded in the attack are still being treated and are expected to make a recovery. It was another foreign-born resident of the city, Somali-born Australian, Hassan Khalif Shire Ali, who carried out the deadly knife rampage. The 30-year-old fled with his family from war-ravaged Somali to Australia as a child in the 1980s. He was killed yesterday afternoon after driving a 4x4 laden with gas cylinders into the city centre and stabbing three passersby before being confronted by members of the public and armed officers who eventually shot him in the chest. Unconfirmed local media reports suggested he may also have had problems with substance abuse and mental health issues. But he was known by intelligence services to hold extremist views and for now the authorities are treating the attack as a terrorist incident. They have questioned around 35 people who saw the daytime attack, which although crude, was said to have been designed to “cause terror and cause maximum casualties” in the heart of Melbourne. Armed officers raided two addresses in the west and northeast of the city, linked to the perpetrator’s family and associates, although there is not thought to be an ongoing threat. Australian authorities now face difficult questions about how Shire Ali, who was known to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation for at least three years, was able to carry out an attack. He had his Australian passport revoked in 2015 amid fears he was trying to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State (IS) group. His brother will go on trial next year on separate terror-related charges — accused of trying to acquire a firearm and kill people in a New Years’ Eve crowd. “The assessment was made that whilst he had radicalised views he didn’t pose a threat to the national security environment,” Ian Mccartney, a federal police counterterrorism official said of Shire Ali. Mccartney described the attack as a “wake up call” even as IS loses territory in Iraq and Syria, where Australian forces are part of a coalition fighting the group. “The circumstances of how he and when he moved from having these radicalised views to carrying out this attack yesterday will be a key focus of the investigation,” Mccartney added. IS — which often claims responsibility for such attacks — said via its propaganda arm that the perpetrator was an “Islamic State fighter and carried out the operation.” It provided no evidence to back its claim. Witness Chris Newport, 60, who also moved to Melbourne decades ago from overseas, described how he had been returning from a job interview when he heard a loud noise and saw a truck on fire, rolling across the tram tracks before a second, louder bang. Police said that Shire Ali’s improvised explosive device was made up of gas cylinders and some form of lighter and “certainly wasn’t sophisticated”. “In a split second everything changes” Newport told AFP, describing Shire Ali manically brandishing a knife. “You can’t imagine someone deciding to do that.” Police struggled for at least a minute to corral the towering man as he lunged, slashed and stabbed wildly at two officers. At least two members of the public stepped in to help police. One man was armed with a cafe chair while another — swiftly dubbed an “Aussie hero” on social media — repeatedly tried to ram the suspect with an empty metal shopping cart. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the country would be unflinching in the fight against “radical, violent... extremist Islam that opposes our very way of life”. Shire Ali “sought to instil fear in our nation. Like those who tried before him, this terrorist failed,” he said. He cited more than a dozen foiled terror plots as evidence that Australians could have faith in their counterterrorism authorities."
Police probe deadly rampage in Belgian city,"LIEGE, Belgium: Belgian police were Wednesday investigating how a gunman known for contacts with Islamist extremists came to launch a brazen suspected terror attack, shooting dead two female officers with their own weapons before killing a bystander. Belgian police are investigating how a gunman known for contacts with Islamist extremists came to launch a suspected terror attack, shooting dead two female officers with their own weapons before killing a bystander The late morning bloodshed shocked the eastern industrial city of Liege when the attacker armed with a knife repeatedly stabbed the two policewomen before using their own firearms to kill them. Police were scrambling to unpick the motives of the attacker identified as Benjamin Herman, a 36-year-old with a decade spent in and out of prison for acts of violence and petty crimes, who was out of jail on leave when he attacked. Amateur footage obtained by AFP showed the gunman shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" (Arabic for ""God is greatest"") as he walked through the Liege streets during the rampage. In another video, the suspect darts out of a school where he had holed up into a short and intense burst of police gunfire, after which the man collapses to the ground. (Video YouTube/The Guardian) Federal prosecutors said they had launched a terror investigation into the incident and would hold a press conference at 10:30 am (0830 GMT) Wednesday, though Interior Minister Jan Jambon urged caution over any extremist angle. ""There are signals that there was radicalisation in the prison but did this radicalisation lead to these actions? There too we can ask ourselves a lot of questions,"" he told RTL radio. Special attention is being given to the gruesome murder of an alleged heroin dealer linked to Herman who was bludgeoned to death with a hammer late Monday near the Luxembourg border. Investigators on Tuesday found the hammer in Herman's car and Jambon said police believed the Liege attacker carried out the killing just hours after getting temporary release from prison. He ""had nothing to lose"" after ""committing a murder (in the night of Monday to Tuesday),"" a source close to the investigation told AFP. As well as the two policewomen, the attacker also shot dead a 22-year-old student sitting in a parked car in central Liege. He then took a female cleaner hostage in the nearby Leonie de Waha school, a public institution with several hundred students aged from two to 18. The two murdered police officers were identified as Lucile Garcia, 53, who had recently become a grandmother, and Soraya Belkacemi, 45, a mother to 13-year-old twins. Debate in Belgium was swirling on the country's prison policy with reports that Herman had repeatedly blown the conditions of his temporary leave from jail ahead of his full release set for 2020. ""I feel responsible because I have responsibility for prisons,"" Belgian Justice Minister Koen Geens told RTBF radio. Liege, a major city in Belgium's blighted rustbelt, was the scene of another bloody shootout in 2011 when a former convict killed six people and wounded more than 120 before turning the gun on himself. Liege police on Tuesday said it was ""clear that the assassin's objective was to attack the police"" and that one of the four officers wounded had suffered a serious leg injury. Prime Minister Charles Michel denounced what he called the ""cowardly and blind violence"" of Tuesday's attack. - Terror alert - Belgium has been on alert since authorities in January 2015 smashed a terror cell in the town of Verviers near Liege that was planning an attack on police. The cell also had links to Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the mastermind of the November 2015 Islamic State attacks on Paris that killed 130 people. Belgium further raised its terror alert level after the Paris attack and placed the capital Brussels on lockdown for a week. IS suicide attacks then targeted Brussels airport and a metro station, leaving 32 people dead in March 2016. In August that same year, a machete-wielding man shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" attacked two policewomen in the industrial town of Charleroi before being shot dead. The country's law enforcement agencies and intelligence services came under intense scrutiny for apparently missing a series of leads after the Paris attacks that could have led to the Brussels bombers.

"Police have arrested 389 over IS-linked activities since 2013, IGP says","KUALA LUMPUR, March 25 — The police have arrested 389 people suspected to have been involved in IS-related activities since 2013, including six Malaysians arrested recently for allegedly planning to attack non-Muslim houses of worship and abduct and kill policemen. Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Mohamed Fuzi Harun said today the arrests resulted from close monitoring and security intelligence. The latest to be arrested were six Malaysians, on Feb 27 this year, and a Filipino national, on March 15, he said when addressing the 211th Police Day parade at the Police Training Centre here. “The Malaysian suspects were allegedly planning to launch attacks on non-Muslim houses of worship and abduct and kill policemen. The Filipino national is wanted by the Philippine authorities for having been involved in cases of kidnapping for ransom and several murder attempts,” he said. Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, Chief Secretary to the Government Tan Sri Ali Hamsa and Home Ministry secretary-general Datuk Seri Alwi Ibrahim were also present at the event. Mohamad Fuzi said the police force had maintained excellence, helping to reduce the crime index by 13,186 cases or 11.7 per cent last year compared to 2016. “Violent crimes dropped by 960 cases of 4.3 per cent and property crimes by 12,226 cases or 13.6 per cent. “Based on the threshold set, the crime index showed a drop of 9.7 per cent from January to March 15 this year while violent crimes dropped by 16.2 per cent and property crimes by 7.9 per cent, he said. Mohamad Fuzi said that though the crime index had dropped, the fear-of-crime phenomenon continued to grip the people, and the police would hold more police-community programmes. On the preparations for the coming general election, he said the police force was at the highest level of readiness, having drawn up strategic programmes since last year. “This includes the initiative of the Bukit Aman Internal Security and Public Order Department in conducting GE14 simulation exercises throughout the country,” he said. On the Eastern Sabah Security Zone (ESSZone), Mohamad Fuzi said the level of security was at the maximum there in the face of the still-active threat of abductions for ransom by the Abu Sayyaf and other militant groups. “Alhamdulillah (Praise be to God), no Malaysians became the victims of abduction in the ESSZone waters last year,” he said. — Bernama"
"Indonesia church attacks kill six, dozens wounded","Three separate locations in the city of Surabaya were hit by the bombings around 7:30 am (0030 GMT), which left at least 35 injured. No one has yet claimed responsibility. Images from one scene showed a body lying outside the gate of Santa Maria catholic church and members of Indonesia's bomb squad poring over the rubble. ""Six people are dead and 35 are in hospital,"" East Java Police spokesman Frans Barung Mangera said, adding that two police officers were among the injured. At least one of the attackers was killed when they detonated their bomb at Santa Maria. It was not clear if any other perpetrators were killed or injured. The attacks come several days after five Indonesian police officers and an inmate were killed in clashes at a high-security jail on the outskirts of Jakarta. AFP / JUNI KRISWANTOExtremists have mounted a series of attacks against Christians and other minorities in recent years The Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility for that incident although police rejected its involvement. The Southeast Asian nation's 260 million people includes significant numbers of Christians, Hindus and Buddhists but there are concerns over rising intolerance. Indonesian police shot and wounded a man who attacked a church congregation in the town of Sleman with a sword during a Sunday mass in February. The radical Islamist, who had wanted to fight with the Islamic State group in Syria, injured four people. Indonesia, which will begin the holy fasting month Ramadan this week, has been on high alert after a string of recent plots and attacks by militants inspired by IS. The archipelago nation of some 17,000 islands has long struggled with Islamic militancy and has suffered a series of attacks in the past 15 years -- including the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people, mostly foreign tourists, in the country's worst-ever terror attack. A sustained crackdown weakened the most dangerous networks but the emergence of IS has proved a potent new rallying cry for radicals. Hundreds of Indonesians have flocked to fight with IS, sparking fears that extremist outfits could get a new lease on life. A gun and suicide attack in the capital Jakarta left four attackers and four civilians dead in January 2016, and was the first assault claimed by IS in Southeast Asia. The attack on a district packed with malls, embassies and United Nations offices left around 20 others injured. Previous incidents have included a 2004 suicide car bomb that killed 10 outside the Australian embassy in Jakarta, twin bomb blasts that killed 22 in a market in the Central Sulawesi town of Tentena, and a suicide bombing in 2005 that left 20 dead in Bali. Seven people were killed, six of them foreigners, and more than 40 were injured when suicide bombers targeted the luxury Ritz-Carlton and JW Marriott hotels in Jakarta in July 2009."
Malaysia police hunt for four ISIS militants still on the run,"Malaysia's police chief Mohamad Fuzi Harun said in a statement on Monday (April 16) that six members of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) cell were arrested between Feb 27 and March 1. But four others were still on the run. Police said the men were ""dangerous"" and ""capable of launching attacks that could pose a threat to national security"". Clockwise from top left: The suspects listed were named as Muhamad Faizal Muhamad Hanafi, Muhamad Hanafi Yah, both of whom are from Kelantan state, Awae Wae-Eya, a Thai national living in southern Thailand and Nor Farkhan Mohd Isa, whose address was given as being in southern Johor. (Courtesy of Royal Malaysian Police/-) Two of the suspects listed were named as Muhamad Faizal Muhamad Hanafi and Muhamad Hanafi Yah, both from Kelantan state. A third suspect is Nor Farkhan Mohd Isa, whose address was given as being in Taman Ungku Tun Aminah in Skudai, southern Johor. The fourth suspect is Awae Wae-Eya, a Thai national living in Narathiwat province in southern Thailand. ""We have been monitoring the cells for the last few months. We are asking the public to share with us if they have any information on the whereabouts of these four suspects. They should approach the police if they know anything,"" Bukit Aman Special Branch's Counter Terrorism chief Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay told The Straits Times. Intelligence sources say they believe Awae is the group's mastermind, based on interrogation of the six men arrested, and that he is trying to establish an ISIS cell in southern Thailand. The arrests of the other members of the terror cell, which included two men working as janitors in Singapore, were previously announced on March 24. The plot was uncovered after Malaysian counter-terrorism police, aided by their Singaporean counterparts, detained the terrorists in a series of swoops. The order to kidnap and kill policemen was the first of its kind, according to an intelligence source. The six men who were nabbed earlier included a 37-year-old technician who was initially thought to have masterminded the plans to attack places of worship in Johor Baru. The second suspect, a 49-year-old security guard, was the cell's adviser and responsible for keeping the cell and its plans secret. Also picked up during the raids was a 30-year-old security guard, who was tasked with acquiring firearms from a neighbouring country and scouting for non-Muslim houses of worship to target. Another suspect, a 25-year-old waiter, had been ordered to kidnap and kill policemen. Two others, aged 23 and 22, were arrested on March 1 and worked as janitors in Singapore. One of them acted as the intermediary in the purchase of firearms for the cell, while the other was picked up to facilitate police investigations. A member of the Abu Sayyaf group in the Philippines was also arrested during the police crackdown, in Sabah, on March 15. The 31-year-old man is said to be a trusted lieutenant to Furuji Indama, the group's leader based in Basilan. Believed to have connections to Malaysian militant Mahmud Ahmad, he is also wanted by Philippines authorities for involvement in a kidnap-for-ransom syndicate. He is an expert in making improvised explosive devices and had planned to attack several locations in Sabah. Malaysia has arrested nearly 400 people since 2013 for suspected links to terrorism. The Muslim-majority nation faces threats from self-radicalised ISIS sympathisers at home, and regional militant groups which seek funding and refuge in South-east Asia. Malaysia's only terrorist attack took place in June 2016, when two men on a motorcycle lobbed a grenade into a nightclub in Selangor, injuring eight people. The men were sentenced to 25 years' jail each."
New anti-terror unit boosts SAF," THE Philippine National Police is set to form additional five battalions of police commandos—a maximum 4,000 men—to enhance the government’s fight against terrorists and all forms of threats to the country’s internal security. PNP chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa said the formation of the five battalions of the Special Action Force was  created solely to combat terrorism and criminality. “After a review of the PNP’s proposal, the Commission approved the creation of five additional SAF to effectively carry out the mandate of the PNP to actively support the Armed Forces in internal security operations for the suppression of insurgency and other serious threats to national security pursuant to Executive Order No. 546, series of 2006,” said Napolcom vice chairman and executive officer Rogelio Casurao. The approval came barely a day after the PNP arrested an Egyptian national suspected to have links with the Islamic State. Meanwhile, the military warned Friday that jihadists were waging a fresh and deadly bid to set up a Southeast Asian caliphate in Mindanao. The gunmen have mustered a force of about 200 fighters and fought a series of skirmishes with the security forces this year after government forces retook Marawi last October, Colonel Romeo Brawner told AFP. “They have not abandoned their objective to create a caliphate in Southeast Asia,” said Brawner, the commander of a Marawi-based military task force. “Mindanao is the most fertile ground,” he said, referring to the country’s southern region. Struggling with widespread poverty and armed Muslim insurgencies seeking independence or self-rule, Mindanao must improve poor supervision of Islamic schools or madrasas where most young gunmen are recruited, Brawner added. He said the armed forces are retooling to meet the challenge of the Maute group, which occupied Marawi over five months and has pledged allegiance to the Middle East-based Islamic State group.Gunmen who escaped during the early days of the US-backed operation to recapture Marawi are leading the recruitment effort, flush with cash, guns and jewellery looted from the city’s banks and private homes, Brawner said. The recruits are mostly locals, but an unspecified number of Indonesians, some with bomb-making skills, have recently arrived there, he said. Mindanao military officials said the Maute gunmen murdered three traders in the town of Piagapo, near Marawi, in November last year. Three jihadists were killed in Pantar, another neighboring town, on Feb. 8, while three of the Piagapo merchants’ suspected killers were arrested in that town last month. The military also reported skirmishes with the Maute gunmen in the towns of Masiu and Pagayawan near Marawi last month. The renewed fighting came after President Duterte and other political leaders in the Mindanao region warned of a potential repeat of the siege of Marawi which claimed more than 1,100 lives. Duterte imposed martial law over Mindanao until the end of the year to curb the militants’ challenge. Ebrahim Murad, head of the Philippines’ main Muslim rebel group the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which signed a peace treaty with Manila in 2014, also warned Tuesday that jihadists were recruiting and could seize another Filipino city.

Former Al-Qaeda man among five terror suspects nabbed by Malaysian police,"KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysia arrested five terror suspects in October, including a former Al-Qaeda operative who had dealings with the Afghanistan-based terror group's slain leader Osama bin Laden. National police chief Mohamad Fuzi Harun said on Wednesday (Oct 31) the five included two Malaysians, a Pakistani, an Egyptian and a Middle Eastern man.They were detained in Selangor, Perak, Kuala Lumpur and Sabah by counter-terrorism officers during the operation from Oct 13 to Oct 26. The two Malaysians - a man and a woman - had channelled funds to their compatriot Muhammad Wanndy Mohamed Jedi, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) recruiter killed in a drone strike in Raqqa last year. The 32-year-old woman arrested in Kuala Lumpur on Oct 25 had moved money to Wanndy between 2014 and 2017. A 40-year-old service manager from Sabah was held on Oct 26, also for channelling funds to Wanndy and the latter's would-be successor Muhamad Fudhail Omar, who was also killed in Syria last year. He is also alleged to have helped fund the Filipino militant group Abu Sayyaf since 2015. Abu Sayyaf is notorious for demanding ransom after abducting people off the coast of Sabah, which faces the southern Philippines. Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi said the Egyptian suspect had worked in Kuala Lumpur. ""The first suspect is a 50-year-old Egyptian working as an executive manager in a Kuala Lumpur firm, and was detained in Selangor on Oct 13, 2018. The suspect was a former Al-Qaeda member while in Afghanistan from 1988 to 1993. He had met with Osama bin Laden,"" he said. The Egyptian had used fake travel documents to enter Canada, Azerbaijan and Pakistan and has been previously arrested in Canada and Egypt for the same offence. According to Inspector-General Mohamad Fuzi, the other two foreigners were apprehended on Oct 20 and Oct 25, respectively. A 31-year-old Middle Eastern was intercepted at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. ""He had issued a death threat against a foreign diplomat in Kuala Lumpur and is suspected (of) involvement in terrorism,"" the police chief said. The Pakistani, a 31-year-old labourer, was taken into custody in the town of Sitiawan, Perak, after police discovered his involvement in Lashkar-e-Taiba, one of the largest and most active Islamic terror groups in South Asia, mainly operating in Pakistan. The trained militant has been in Malaysia since 2016. Malaysia has arrested more than 420 terror suspects since 2013, and foiled plots largely to launch attacks locally. The country's first and only terrorist attack took place in June 2016, when two men on a motorcycle lobbed a grenade into a nightclub in Selangor, injuring eight people. The men were sentenced to 25 years' jail."
"After counter-terror swoop in state, mufti says Perlis not hotbed of extremism","AMMAN, Jordan, Oct 6 — Students intending to pursue their studies at religious learning centres in Perlis as well as teachers who want to work there must undergo security screening and be declared ‘clean’ by police. Perlis mufti Prof Madya Dr Mohd Asri Zainul Abidin said the state police chief SAC Noor Mushar Mohamad himself had been appointed a member of the state Islamic Religious Council Committee. “I always ask the state police chief about the students at these learning centres, especially the foreigners. Only with police confirmation will we allow them (to pursue studies at the religious learning centres),” he told Bernama here today. He was commenting on the arrests of eight men including seven foreigners by the Bukit Aman Special Branch Counter Terrorism Division following an operation in Perlis, Kuala Lumpur and Johor on September 24 for suspected involvement in activities that were detrimental to security and public order. Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi Harun was reported as saying on October 6 that all of the suspects were involved with an Islamic learning centre in Perlis, believed to be promoting extremist teachings. Mohd Asri stressed that the arrests of the eight individuals did not mean that Perlis was the centre for the spreading of radical teachings. “We have nothing to do with the issue as the people of Perlis are adopting the values of moderation. “I want the police to conduct a transparent investigation as the heads of these centres have given their assurance that they will take action if there is a spread of radicalism or terrorism in their institutions,” he said. Mohd Asri is accompanying the Raja Muda of Perlis Tuanku Syed Faizuddin Putra Jamalullail who is currently on a working visit to Jordan."
Counter-terror police nab eight over radicalisation plans," KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 6 — The federal police’s counter-terrorism division arrested seven foreigners and one Malaysian late last month on suspicion of planning to destabilise the local democracy and spreading religious extremism. According to Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Mohd Fuzi Harun, early investigations showed the suspects planned to instill views that trousers, tertiary education in non-religious institutions, and workplaces without gender segregation to all be haram or forbidden in Islam. “Preliminary investigations by police and shared information with foreign intelligence agencies revealed that the foreigners have links to a madrasah in Dammaj, Yemen that was founded by Syeikh Muqbil Hadi Al Wadi’i, an extremist Salafi jihadist. “The madrasah in Yemen is a stronghold of the Salafi jihadist ideology that permits the killing of non-Muslims as well as Muslims not aligned with them and consequently deemed unbelievers; it also labelled democracy as Thoghut (against Allah’s law),” he said in a statement. Of the group arrested, the IGP said six foreigners — one from the Americas and five from Europe — were picked up from a religious centre in Perlis. One suspect is believed to have undergone weapons training in Yemen, but all are believed to be linked to the Islamic State group. A Middle Easterner was also arrested in Kuala Lumpur, also at a religious centre where he is believed to have been spreading extremist ideology to Klang Valley residents. The Malaysian was detained in Muar, Johor, where he worked  as a trader. The suspect is an alumni of the religious school in Perlis where the six above were arrested. All the arrests were made on September 24. “This is not the first time foreign Salafi jihadist elements have used Malaysia as a launchpad to spread the ideology and recruit new members. “The modus operandi was used by Abdullah Sungkar and Abu Bakar Bashir, leaders of the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist group to infiltrate Malaysia in 1985 and form Islamic centres in Negri Sembilan and Johor to spread the ideology,” Mohd Fuzi said. The eight were arrested for terrorism-related offences under the Penal Code and being held with the invocation of the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act."
Woman held for attempted murder in British knife attack,"BARNSLEY, United Kingdom (AFP) - British police arrested a woman for attempted murder on Saturday (Sept 8) after reports that she chased a man through a shopping district with a large knife before stabbing him. ""A 28-year-old woman arrested this morning on suspicion of attempted murder remains in police custody,"" police said after the incident in the northern English city of Barnsley. ""The woman is currently being assessed from a mental health perspective."" One man suffered minor injuries in the attack. Britain is on high alert after a string of deadly terror attacks, many involving knives, and the incident raised fears of terrorism. Assistant Chief Constable Tim Forbes of South Yorkshire Police earlier said officers were ""keeping an open mind as to the motivation"". He said his force was ""receiving support"" from a local counter-terrorism unit. Market stall holder Terry Ellis told AFP he saw a woman with a ""big knife"", measuring about 30cm running after a man and shouting ""kill, kill, kill"".

Woman held after UK knife attack sparks terror fears,"BARNSLEY, Sept 8 ? British police arrested a woman today after she chased a man through a shopping district with a large knife before stabbing him, in an incident that raised fears of terrorism. “One woman has been arrested and remains in police custody following reports of a stabbing in Barnsley town centre” in northern England, South Yorkshire Police said in a statement. “One man suffered minor injuries. No other injuries have been reported at this time.” Assistant Chief Constable Tim Forber said officers were “keeping an open mind as to the motivation”, adding that they were “receiving support” from a local counter-terrorism unit. Market stall holder Terry Ellis told AFP he saw a woman with a “big knife, (measuring) about 12 inches” (30.5cm) running after a man and shouting “kill, kill, kill”. Another trader, Abdul Razak, added: “This lady followed this man saying I’ll kill you, I’ll kill you.” Other local traders said the stabbing, initially declared by police as a “serious incident”, caused the covered market and other parts of the town centre to be “locked down”. Britain is on high alert after a string of deadly terror attacks, many involving knives. Police were alerted at around 8.20am (0720 GMT) to reports of a woman with a knife in the town centre. “A kitchen knife has been recovered by officers and is being forensically examined,” Forber said. He called on any witnesses to come forward, but urged locals to remain calm. “We understand that this morning’s incident will have been distressing and shocking for those in the town centre and wider Barnsley communities,” he said. “Rest assured we are working relentlessly to piece together what happened.” Several crime scenes have been established and police said they would stay in the area until there was more clarity about what happened.

German police arrest Russian over alleged jihadist bomb plot,"BERLIN, Aug 22 — German police commandos today arrested a Russian suspected Islamist militant accused of having plotted an explosives attack in the country. Identified only as 31-year-old Magomed-Ali C., he was allegedly an accomplice of Clement Baur, who was arrested in Marseilles shortly before the 2017 French elections accused of plotting an imminent attack. The Russian man “is suspected of having plotted, together with Clement B., detained in France, a serious act of violence against the state,” German federal prosecutors said in a statement. Commandos of the elite police unit GSG 9 stormed the man’s Berlin apartment in an operation which prosecutors said was linked to the Baur case. Baur and another suspect, who had both pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, were arrested in April 2017 in a Marseilles apartment. French police found an IS flag, a loaded Uzi sub-machine gun, two pistols, a homemade grenade and TATP, a volatile explosive dubbed “mother of Satan”. The German prosecutors said that Magomed-Ali C. and Baur had also planned an explosives attack “at an unknown location in Germany, meant to maim or kill the greatest possible number of people”. For this purpose, Magomed-Ali C. had kept in his Berlin flat “a substantial amount” of TATP since at least October 2016. Those attack plans were foiled however by an unspecified German “preventive police operation”, which led the accomplices to split up and Baur to travel to France, said the prosecutors. "
UK police rush to solve Novichok nerve agent death," LONDON, July 9 — British police rushed to solve a murder mystery today after a woman died following exposure to the nerve agent Novichok, four months after the same toxin was used against a former Russian spy in an attack that Britain blamed on Moscow. Prime Minister Theresa May said she was “appalled and shocked” by the death of Dawn Sturgess, a 44-year-old mother of three who had been living in a homeless hostel in the city of Salisbury in southwest England. Sturgess and Charlie Rowley, 45, fell ill last weekend in the town of Amesbury, near Salisbury, the city where former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were attacked with the Novichok nerve agent in March and have since recovered. Local MP John Glen said the local community was “anxious” after police opened a murder inquiry, although health officials have said the danger to the general public is low. Glen told BBC radio the two may have handled a contaminated object because of their “habit of looking into bins” and police were trying to work out “how they came into contact with this nerve agent and when”. Britain and its allies accused Russia of trying to kill the Skripals, prompting angry denials and sparking an international diplomatic crisis. Police said they would be led by the evidence but confirmed a link between the Amesbury case and the Salisbury attack was a main line of inquiry. Interior minister Sajid Javid last week demanded answers from Moscow, saying he would not accept Britain becoming a “dumping ground for poison”. Police said the British couple were believed to have become exposed to Novichok by handling a “contaminated item”, with speculation that it could have been the container used to administer the nerve agent to the Skripals. However, police and public health officials insist the risk to the wider public remains low. A police officer was tested for possible exposure to the deadly nerve agent over the weekend but was given the all-clear. Christine Blanshard, medical director at Salisbury District Hospital, where Sturgess and Rowley were being treated and where the Skripals were hospitalised, told the Daily Telegraph that staff had “worked tirelessly to save Dawn”. “Our staff are talented, dedicated and professional and I know today they will be hurting today,” she said. The prime minister said: “Police and security officials are working urgently to establish the facts of this incident, which is now being investigated as a murder.” Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the head of Britain’s counter-terror police, said Sturgess’s death “has only served to strengthen our resolve to identify and bring to justice the person or persons responsible for what I can only describe as an outrageous, reckless and barbaric act”. He added that the other victim “remains critically ill in hospital and our thoughts are with him and his family as well”. Residents of the homeless hostel in Salisbury where Sturgess lived, which was evacuated after the couple fell ill, expressed their devastation at the news of her death. “It could easily have happened to anyone, to me or my partner,” 27-year-old Ben Jordan told AFP late Sunday. “We are really, really sad. I am praying for Charlie.” Around 100 counter-terrorism officers are helping in the investigation, which police said Friday could take “weeks and months”. So far, there is no evidence that the couple visited any of the sites involved in the Skripal case. “Detectives will continue with their painstaking and meticulous work to gather all the available evidence so that we can understand how two citizens came to be exposed with such a deadly substance that tragically cost Dawn her life,” Basu said. Sturgess collapsed on the morning of June 30 and was taken to hospital. That afternoon, Rowley fell ill at the same address in Amesbury and was also hospitalised. It was not until the Wednesday, however, that the government’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down confirmed their exposure to Novichok. “Detectives are working as quickly and as diligently as possible to identify the source of the contamination, but this has not been established at this time,” police said on Sunday. “We are not in a position to say whether the nerve agent was from the same batch that the Skripals were exposed to.” The Skripals were released from hospital but the investigation into the attack on them continues. No arrests have been made."
 UK marks anniversary of London mosque terror attack,"LONDON, July 20 — Britain yesterday marked the first anniversary of a deadly terror attack against a north London mosque, with Prime Minister Theresa May vowing that “vile extremism” will not divide the nation. Mourners held a minute’s silence at 9.30am to remember father-of-six Makram Ali, who died when Darren Osbourne ploughed a hire van onto a crowded pavement close to Finsbury Park mosque, intending to kill as many Muslims as possible. The attack, on June 19 last year, also left 12 injured. Home Secretary Sajid Javid, London Mayor Sadiq Khan and opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn all attended the event at nearby Islington Town Hall, along with the imam of the mosque, Mohammed Mahmoud. “A man ridden with racism drove a vehicle into a crowd of people and tried to divide and destroy our community,” said Corbyn. “We will never allow them to destroy us. Stay united, stay together, support each other!”, he added. Osbourne, 48, left a note in the van, in which he said he was seeking revenge for Islamist terror attacks and a child sex scandal, and named mayor Khan as someone that he also wanted to kill. The mayor paid tribute to the response of the local community. “The way this community has responded has inspired us all,” he said. “When Londoners face adversity we stand up for our values. This is our city, this is our way of life. For those who seek to divide us, the message is ‘you will never succeed’.” Osbourne, from the Welsh capital Cardiff, was in February sentenced to life in prison with a minimum 43-year term. “Last year’s cowardly attack which targeted innocent worshippers leaving Finsbury Park mosque is an attack on all of us,” May said in a statement. “As with all acts of terrorism the intention was to divide us but we will not let this happen. “We are a country of many faiths and freedom of worship and respect for those of different faiths is fundamental to this country’s values and these values will never be broken by vile extremism,” she added. When passing sentence at a London court, judge Bobbie Cheema-Grubb said that Osbourne had been “rapidly radicalised” and that his “mindset became one of malevolent hatred”. “In short you allowed your mind to be poisoned by those who claimed to be leaders.” Osbourne became radicalised over a month last year after watching a television programme about a child sex ring scandal involving a gang of mainly Muslim men in northern England. Nigel Bromage, a former leader of a neo-Nazi group who later turned anti far-right campaigner, called the attack “a sobering reminder that the threat from far-right extremism is no different from the Islamist threat. “Both share a common desire to spread fear and divide society, ultimately two sides of the same coin,” he added. Witnesses recalled Osbourne saying: “I’ve done my job, you can kill me now” and “at least I had a proper go” in the immediate aftermath of the attack. The handwritten note found in the van read: “Why are their terrorists on our streets today? “Islam’s ideology doesn’t belong here and neither does sharia law.” The Manchester suicide bombing in May 2017 and the London Bridge van attack and stabbing rampage in June that year further fuelled his obsession, the court was told."
Officer praised for saving young girl in attack on Surabaya Police,"Sr. Adj. Comr. Roni Faisal Saiful Fatoni is the head of Surabaya Police’s narcotics division. Recently, however, he has received an avalanche of praise from across the country, not for taking down drug dealers, but for rescuing a child from the smoldering wreckage of a bomb detonated by her own parents – a bomb that was meant to kill him and his colleagues. On Monday morning, Roni and several other police officers were on standby at their office trying to make sense of a spate of terror attacks that had struck the city the day before. The Surabaya Police were aware that they could very well be the terrorists’ next target, so heavier security was placed around their headquarters. Their instincts may have saved the lives of many police officers, as that Monday morning, five people on two motorcycles approached the headquarters’ main entrance at high speed. Mere seconds after stopping at the security gates, as ordered by officers, the bombs strapped to their bodies went off, throwing nearby personnel to the ground. Four people on the motorcycles were killed instantly, but an 8-year-old girl – the daughter of the perpetrators – survived. Amid the panic, with flames and smoke still billowing from the site of the explosion, the young girl could be seen rising unsteadily to her feet. She tried to move away from the ruins but was unable to walk due to her injuries. Without knowing whether a second bomb was set to go off or, worse, whether the child had explosives strapped to her body, Roni rushed toward the girl and scooped her up in his arms to take her to safety. ""I have a daughter exactly her age. My immediate instinct was to save this little girl,"" Roni said in a recent interview with Kompas.TV. Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, East Java Police chief Insp. Gen. Machfud Arifin said: “If there had been a bomb tied to the child’s belly, I would have lost my narcotics division head.” Footage of Roni’s daring move quickly made the rounds on TV news outlets as well as social media platforms. Netizens responded by praising his actions as “heroic”, with many lauding him for saving the child without hesitation and at the risk of his own life. Praise was also directed at the National Police for their swift actions in handling the terrorist threats when they themselves had become a target. ""Feeling touched. Thanks Pak Roni for saving her,"" @Anaa said on Twitter. Flower boards with messages supporting the police can still be seen around the East Java Police headquarters. ""We support the police in keeping NKRI [the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia] safe,"" one message reads."
"Indonesia church attacks kill six, dozens wounded","SURABAYA, Indonesia: A wave of blasts including a suicide bombing struck outside churches in Indonesia on Sunday, killing at least six and wounding dozens of others, police said, the latest assault on a religious minority in the world's biggest Muslim-majority country. The deadly blasts all occurred within 10 minutes of each other, police said Three separate locations in the city of Surabaya were hit by the bombings around 7:30 am (0030 GMT), which left at least 35 injured. No one has yet claimed responsibility. Images from one scene showed a body lying outside the gate of Santa Maria catholic church and members of Indonesia's bomb squad poring over the rubble. ""Six people are dead and 35 are in hospital,"" East Java Police spokesman Frans Barung Mangera said, adding that two police officers were among the injured. At least one of the attackers was killed when they detonated their bomb at Santa Maria. It was not clear if any other perpetrators were killed or injured. The attacks come several days after five Indonesian police officers and an inmate were killed in clashes at a high-security jail on the outskirts of Jakarta. The Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility for that incident although police rejected its involvement. The Southeast Asian nation's 260 million people includes significant numbers of Christians, Hindus and Buddhists but there are concerns over rising intolerance. Indonesian police shot and wounded a man who attacked a church congregation in the town of Sleman with a sword during a Sunday mass in February. The radical Islamist, who had wanted to fight with the Islamic State group in Syria, injured four people. - High alert - Indonesia, which will begin the holy fasting month Ramadan this week, has been on high alert after a string of recent plots and attacks by militants inspired by IS. The archipelago nation of some 17,000 islands has long struggled with Islamic militancy and has suffered a series of attacks in the past 15 years -- including the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people, mostly foreign tourists, in the country's worst-ever terror attack. A sustained crackdown weakened the most dangerous networks but the emergence of IS has proved a potent new rallying cry for radicals. Hundreds of Indonesians have flocked to fight with IS, sparking fears that extremist outfits could get a new lease on life. A gun and suicide attack in the capital Jakarta left four attackers and four civilians dead in January 2016, and was the first assault claimed by IS in Southeast Asia. The attack on a district packed with malls, embassies and United Nations offices left around 20 others injured. Previous incidents have included a 2004 suicide car bomb that killed 10 outside the Australian embassy in Jakarta, twin bomb blasts that killed 22 in a market in the Central Sulawesi town of Tentena, and a suicide bombing in 2005 that left 20 dead in Bali. Seven people were killed, six of them foreigners, and more than 40 were injured when suicide bombers targeted the luxury Ritz-Carlton and JW Marriott hotels in Jakarta in July 2009."
Malaysian police hunting for four suspected ISIS militants,"Malaysian police are hunting for four militants suspected of planning attacks on non-Muslim places of worship, as well as plotting to kidnap and murder police officers. Police chief Mohamad Fuzi Harun said in a statement yesterday that six members of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) cell were arrested between Feb 27 and March 1. But four others were still on the run. Police said the men were ""dangerous"" and ""capable of launching attacks that could pose a threat to national security"". Two of the suspects listed were named as Muhamad Faizal Muhamad Hanafi and Muhamad Hanafi Yah, both from Kelantan. A third suspect is Nor Farkhan Mohd Isa, whose address was given as being in Taman Ungku Tun Aminah in Skudai, southern Johor. The fourth is Awae Wae-Eya, a Thai national living in Narathiwat province in southern Thailand. ""We have been monitoring the cells for the last few months. We are asking the public to share with us if they have any information on the whereabouts of these four suspects. They should approach the police if they know anything,"" the Special Branch's Counter Terrorism chief Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay told The Straits Times. Intelligence sources say they believe Awae is the group's mastermind, based on interrogation of the six men arrested, and that he is trying to establish an ISIS cell in southern Thailand. From left: Terror suspects Awae Wae-Eya, Muhamad Hanafi Yah, Nor Farkhan Mohd Isa and Muhamad Faizal Muhamad Hanafi are still at large. The arrests of the other members of the terror cell, which included two men working as janitors in Singapore, were previously announced on March 24. The plot was uncovered after Malaysian counter-terrorism police, aided by their Singaporean counterparts, detained the terrorists in a series of swoops. The order to kidnap and kill policemen was the first of its kind, according to an intelligence source. The six men nabbed earlier included a 37-year-old technician who was initially thought to have masterminded the plans to attack places of worship in Johor Baru. The second suspect, a 49-year-old security guard, was the cell's adviser and responsible for keeping the cell and its plans secret. Also picked up during the raids was a 30-year old security guard, tasked with acquiring firearms from a neighbouring country and scouting for non-Muslim houses of worship to target. Another suspect, a 25-year-old waiter, had been ordered to kidnap and kill policemen. Two others, aged 23 and 22, were arrested on March 1 and worked as janitors in Singapore. One of them acted as an intermediary to buy firearms. The other was picked up to facilitate police investigations. A member of the Abu Sayyaf group in the Philippines was also arrested during the police crackdown in Sabah on March 15. The 31-year-old man is said to be a trusted lieutenant to Furuji Indama, the group's leader based in Basilan and believed to have connections to Malaysian militant Mahmud Ahmad. He is an expert in making improvised explosive devices and had planned to attack several locations in Sabah. Malaysia has arrested nearly 400 people since 2013 for suspected links to terrorism."
Stopping comms during a terror attack could be a game-changer,"APRIL 4 ? Singapore recently passed the Public Order and Safety (Special Powers) Act (POSSPA), which empowers the police to deal more effectively with evolving and emerging security threats. The new legislation is essentially an update of the Public Order (Preservation) Act. Much interest and debate has been generated over the Communications Stop Order (CSO) provision, which essentially allows the police to prohibit the public in the incident area from “making or communicating films or pictures and text or audio messages about ongoing security operations”. There are safeguards to prevent potential abuse and ensure accountability as the CSO does not “automatically come into force” and must be “specifically unlocked” by the Police Commissioner “as and when deemed necessary” ? but only after the Minister for Home Affairs has activated POSSPA. The CSO aims to deny terrorists access to information, as this could compromise ongoing security operations, and otherwise affect future ones. The Ministry of Home Affairs deemed this critical as getting access to such information could endanger the lives of security personnel and members of the public. One example cited was the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Then, live coverage of ongoing security operations enabled terrorists to anticipate and outmanoeuvre security forces. Another concern is that videos and other media of police operations and tactics, such as their response times and movements, could be studied by those bent on wreaking havoc and be used to plan for future attacks. Apart from operational considerations, the CSO should also be seen broadly as a way to improve risk and crisis management during major security incidents. During any major crises, especially a major security incident like a terror attack, demand for information will expectedly be high. People would want to find out if their loved ones are affected/involved, and if they are, whether they are safe. People directly affected would want to know how to get to safety. Members of the public would also want to help, by providing information they think may be of use to law enforcement officers. There will thus be immense pressure on agencies to put out information quickly. During an unfolding crisis, information may not be available, and even when it does become available, it needs to be verified before being released. When the demand for speedy information is not met, it is natural for some individuals to try and fill the void by pushing out a story or social media post that may be factually inaccurate, or worse, incorrect. As many instances have shown, much of what has been posted by individuals, well-meaning or otherwise, has not been verified. Since smartphones allow individuals to be both information creators and broadcasters, misinformation will inevitably be generated and widely disseminated. Putting out such misinformation can adversely impact the management of an ongoing crisis. First, it could spark smaller crises that would require division of resources and distract officers from dealing with the main incident. A 2011 United States Congressional Research Service report titled Social Media and Disasters: Current Uses, Future Options, and Policy Considerations, warned: “Some individuals or organisations might intentionally provide inaccurate information to confuse, disrupt, or otherwise thwart response efforts One tactic that has been used by terrorists involves the use of a secondary attack after an initial attack to kill and injure first responders. Social media could be used as a tool for such purposes by issuing calls for assistance to an area, or notifying officials of a false hazard or threat that requires a response”. Second, it could create crises that are not easily resolved, such as undermining social cohesion. In December, for instance, rumours circulated via social media that London’s West End was the target of a terror attack, leading to a major stampede as people panicked and attempted to flee the area. Law enforcement was also activated and deployed as there were reports of gunshots. Investigations later revealed that an altercation between two men had actually sparked off the chaos. In this scenario, adversaries could have easily exploited both the bedlam and the fact that law enforcement was preoccupied with dealing with the crises to carry out attacks in other locations. In 2013, a Brown University student, Sunil Tripathi, was misidentified as one of the Boston Marathon bombers. This resulted in a manhunt for the wrong individual, as well as the harassment of his family. In 2015, following the Paris attacks, a photo of Veerender Jubbal, a Canadian of Sikh heritage, was doctored and mis-captioned to portray him as one of the terrorists involved. The photo was so convincing that a Spanish newspaper ran the story. Jubbal is still reportedly treated suspiciously even though it was proven that the story was inaccurate and the photo of him was a hoax. Both examples highlight that certain ethnic or religious groups and individuals can become targets of hate on the basis of misinformation. It is unrealistic to think that misinformation generation and dissemination will be eliminated completely in the immediate aftermath of an incident, even with the CSO. Other measures will be required to help manage the risks as well. First, crisis communication gurus often suggest that an official communications channel/source needs to be established to ensure that accurate and regularly updated information is disseminated to the public. The Queensland Police, for instance, became the sole source of information during the 2011 floods, and used their official social media channels to provide information to the public. The Singapore Police Force’s (SPF) official social media channels/pages and apps will be useful in this regard. Second, active “mythbusting’” on SPF’s social media channels will be useful. The public can send information via the [email protected] and SG Secure apps to the SPF, who can then verify and disseminate the correct information. Even without the use of apps, any information provided by the public that is helpful to the investigations would certainly be welcomed. The bottomline is that it is imperative that any information being disseminated is accurate. The CSO enables Singapore to take a pre-emptive approach to managing risks and crises that could develop as a result of misinformation generation and dissemination, immediately following a major security crisis. This is crucial in an age of deliberate online falsehoods"
 Malaysia charges three with attempting to carry out terror attack in Johor,"JOHOR BARU (THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - A court in the Malaysian state of Johor on Monday (March 26) charged three men for attempting to carry out acts of terror in the city centre and possessing terror-related materials. Nik Muhamad Zaini Nik Hassan, 37, and Ismadi Mohd Nor, also known as Ismail, 30, were both charged at the Sessions court in Johor Baru before Judge Kamarudin Kamsun. They were alleged to have intended to attack a government building along Jalan Abu Bakar in Johor Baru. The road is located not far from the state's largest hospital and near the main square. The duo had been planning their attack at a restaurant in Johor Baru between Dec 11, 2017, and Jan 31 earlier this year. The two face a prison sentence of not more than seven years and are liable for a fine upon conviction. In another case, a security guard was also charged at the same court for possessing videos relating to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terror group. Mohd Zaki Ibrahim, 49, was alleged to have stored the videos inside two Samsung mobile phones at a substation guard post located at the Bandar Baru Permas Jaya suburb of Johor Baru at around 12.30pm on Feb 27. The charge is under paragraph 130JB(1)(a) of the Penal Code (Act 574). If found guilty, he can be sentenced under Subsection 130JB(1) of the same Act, which carries a maximum seven years' jail and a fine. No plea was recorded from all three suspects, who were not represented by lawyers. Judge Kamarudin has set April 26 for the case to be mentioned again."

 Three killed in terror attack in France,"TREBES (France) • Three people were killed in a terrorist attack in France yesterday when a gunman held up a car, opened fire on police and then took hostages in a supermarket, screaming ""Allahu Akbar"". The gunman first hijacked a car, killing one person and wounding another. He then fired on police officers in Carcassonne, wounding an officer in the shoulder before heading to Trebes about 8km to the east, where two more people were killed at the Super-U supermarket. Police later stormed the supermarket in the small south-western town of Trebes. Interior Minister Gerard Collomb later said on Twitter that the attacker had been killed. Two police officers were hurt in the operation, a source said. Mr Collomb named the gunman, who was killed by police, as 26-year-old Redouane Lakdim, a small-time drug dealer. Security sources had said the gunman was believed to be a Moroccan who was on a watch list of suspected extremists, but Mr Collomb did not confirm his nationality. A source at the Interior Ministry said that while two people had died so far during the hostage-taking, the number of fatalities could go up. ""It is a provisional assessment as it could unfortunately get worse. Three people are wounded, including one of them seriously,"" the source said. French President Emmanuel Macron said security forces were securing the area. Speaking at a news conference in Brussels, where he was attending a European Union summit meeting, Mr Macron said: ""We believe that it is indeed a terror attack."" BFM TV station reported that the hostage-taker had claimed allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and that he had demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam - the prime surviving suspect in the ISIS attacks that killed 130 people in Paris in 2015. A 45-year-old lieutenant-colonel swapped himself in exchange for one of the hostages, a source close to the investigation said later, confirming information first published by Le Figaro newspaper. The officer was one of the policemen injured during the operation to kill the gunman. Mr Eric Menassi, the mayor of Trebes, told LCI TV that the man had entered the shop in Trebes screaming ""Allahu Akbar (God is greatest), I'll kill you all"". Ms Carole (only first name given), who was shopping at the supermarket, described how people had taken refuge in a cold room. ""A man shouted and fired several times. I saw a cold room door, I asked people to come and take shelter,"" she told Franceinfo radio. ""There were 10 of us, and we stayed for an hour. There were more gunshots and we went out the back door."" For the French authorities, what was particularly alarming about the events yesterday was that the area targeted was quiet and provincial, far from the big cities that have typically attracted terrorist violence. ""This can strike no matter where, no matter when, no matter how,"" said police union official Yves Lefebvre, speaking on Europe 1 radio. The EU offers its full support to the French people, European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said. More than 240 people have been killed in France since 2015 in attacks by assailants who pledged allegiance to, or were inspired by, ISIS."
Malaysia arrests two ISIS militants over planned attacks on police stations and Buddhist monks,"KUALA LUMPUR (REUTERS, THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Malaysia has arrested two men believed to have links with militant group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), including one who allegedly walked around its capital armed with a knife aiming to kill Buddhist monks, police said on Monday (Jan 22). The Muslim-majority South-east Asian nation has been on high alert since gunmen linked to ISIS launched several attacks in Jakarta, the capital of neighbouring Indonesia, in Jan 2016. The two suspects were arrested in two separate raids in December and January, on suspicion of planning to carry out acts of violence and promoting ISIS ideology. One of them, a 23-year-old Indonesian who was arrested last week on Jan 17, had allegedly scoured a busy district of the capital, Kuala Lumpur, in November, seeking Buddhist monks to kill, in retaliation for violence suffered by Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. ""The attempt failed, and police managed to confiscate a knife during the raid,"" Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi Harun, the inspector-general of police, said in a statement. The suspect had planned to attack the federal police headquarters in Bukit Aman as well as the Travers police station. He added that the suspect had also allegedly communicated with a senior ISIS leader over WhatsApp, had sought to recruit several other Indonesians and put up an ISIS flag at the building site where he worked. The other suspect, a 25-year-old Malaysian teacher at a private religious school, was detained in Dec on suspicion of planning an attack on entertainment outlets and to rob, kidnap or kill non-Muslims. The suspect, who had been previously jailed under Malaysia's anti-terror law, had also maintained contact with former members of known terror groups and promoted ISIS ideology on his Facebook account to recruit new members, police said. Separately,  the Kuala Lumpur High Court on Monday sentenced a former factory supervisor to eight years in jail for attempting to go to Syria with intent to commit terrorist acts. Mohamad Awang, 42, was arrested in Kuala Lumpur on Feb 21 last year with a flight ticket, an international passport, a handphone and several SIM cards in his possession. He had planned to go to Syria via Teheran. Malaysia has arrested hundreds of people over the past few years for suspected links to militant groups. A grenade attack on a bar on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur in June 2016 wounded eight people. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, the first such incident on Malaysian soil. Mr Fuzi also said in a statement on Monday that police will be ramping up security during the Hindu celebration of Thaipusam on Jan 31. ""Police will be increasing security measures in all locations across the country to prevent untoward incidents that could disrupt the event,"" he said."
"Choke off terror recruitment sources, deputy minister urges","PUTRAJAYA, Jan 6 — The international community must work together to eliminate recruitment source of terror groups such as Islamic State (IS) who were quick to take advantage of ethnic and religious conflicts, Datuk Nur Jazlan Mohamed said today. Speaking in a panel at the Putrajaya International Security Dialogue 2018 at the Marriott Hotel here, the deputy home minister said conflicts such as the Rohingya Crisis in Myanmar is of particular concern. “Take for example the oppression and injustice committed against the Rohingyas, we fear that this will create an opportunity for organisations like IS to infiltrate and hijack their struggle, it would be better for us to work together and find a political solution before it evolves into religious strife,” Nur Jazlan said. He said terror groups had at times effectively exploited conflicts and indeed some attacks were specifically designed to cause discord between communities. “This why we see terror organisations purposely commit acts of terror specifically designed to create discord between communities including attacks on mosques and churches to targeted assassinations of community leaders, the goal is to create friction amongst communities,” he said. Nur Jazlan also said the internet, which has proven to be a major medium of recruitment and that every effort needed to be taken to identify extremists using it and to remove propaganda and literature use to draw vulnerable individuals to their cause. He said the present reality was one where conflict in one part of the world could lead to attacks thousands of miles away in the name of groups active in the conflict zone such as the 2016 Movida Club grenade attack in Puchong, and the Battle of Marawi in the Philippines with both claimed by the IS. “The internet, which has created a borderless world and has benefitted communities across the globe, the same technology has also been abused by terrorists. “Malaysia has initiated the Counter Messaging Centre under the purview of Royal Malaysia Police to monitor the use of internet and social media by terror groups to disseminate their radical ideology as well as to counter their narrative,” he said. He added that for a war for the hearts and minds of those who were vulnerable, it is critical to present a counter narrative that would appeal to the target group. “IS continues to recruit new members across the globe, mostly targeting the disfranchised by offering a form of escapism by tainting these young minds with their twisted world view and perverse ideology coupled the promise of a higher purpose in life. “Our counter narrative should be made attractive, relatable and relevant to the younger generation. It needs to be as creative, if not better than the likes of IS in order to counter their propaganda,” he said. Nur Jazlan asserted that Malaysia had been hugely effective in the fight against terrorism but that a greater emphasis needed to be placed on rehabilitation efforts as these would be key to victory in the long run. “Between 2013 and 2017 over 369 suspected IS militants, including 87 foreigners, has been arrested and up to 19 terror plots disrupted. “As nations invests and allocate a huge part of their budget to direct operational anti-terrorism purposes, they must also invest in programmes related to rehabilitation,” he said."
"PAF receives six US drones, beefs up anti-terror assets","The United States gave the Philippine air force on Tuesday its first surveillance drone system, as the two nations step up cooperation in the battle against jihadist militants.Washington has been boosting its backing for Philippine counter-terror efforts since Islamic State supporters seized parts of the southern city of Marawi last year, sparking a deadly five-month battle. The unmanned aerial vehicle system worth $13.2 million, including six drones, turned over to Philippine troops was the latest US military assistance. “Assets like the ScanEagle will significantly improve the [Philippine military’s] ability to detect terrorist activities, piracy activities, territory encroachment,” US Ambassador to Manila Sung Kim told reporters, referring to the drones. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the system, equipped with cameras and aircraft that can fly for 24 hours, would support operations against militants in the south.  The southern region of Mindanao is home to several pro-IS groups, including those that attacked Marawi in May last year in fighting that claimed more than 1,100 lives and reduced large parts of the city to rubble. These new drones are to be used for reconnaissance missions in defense, humanitarian assistance and disaster response, Lorenzana said.  “With a number of security issues confronting our country today, there is a need to upgrade our nation’s armed forces,” Lorenzana said.President Rodrigo Duterte had sought to loosen the Philippines’ 70-year alliance with the US in favor of closer ties with China and Russia.  His anger was partly driven by American criticism of his drug war, which has seen police kill thousands of people and prompted an International Criminal Court preliminary examination. Relations have improved under US President Donald Trump, who has praised Duterte for his drug war but the Philippine leader has increasingly turned to Beijing and Moscow to boost one of Asia’s weakest armed forces.  Duterte last month canceled a deal to buy helicopters from Canada after Ottawa ordered a review over human rights concerns.  “Do not buy anymore from Canada and the US because there is always a condition attached,” Duterte said at the time.  The US embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment on whether the drones implied similar rights concerns."
 Police to be active in anti-terrorism operations," Police forces will be actively involved in addressing terrorism and insurgency problems especially in Mindanao as President Duterte stands firm on how his government will deal with communist terrorists – just like how the Maute Group was flushed out of Marawi City. Director General Ronald dela Rosa, chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP), said that no less than the President has instructed the police leadership to assist the military in running after terror groups and communist rebels. “There will be adjustments because the President wants us to be involved more aggressively in the problem of terrorism and insurgency,” said Dela Rosa. Speaking in Davao City last Friday night, Duterte said in a press conference that government forces will deal with communist fighters just the same as with Islamic State-influenced militants. “And we have this problem of terrorism – we will deal with them just like the way the Armed Forces and the police reacted during the Marawi siege. And for the communists, no quarters, no ask,” Duterte said. The Islamic State-inspired Maute Group occupied Marawi City on May 23, 2017, prompting Duterte to respond by ordering the military to bomb their positions and take them out and placing Mindanao under martial law. Although the PNP has its own elite force to run after insurgents, almost all the operations against terror and rebel groups are being carried out by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). “That is the reason why we are expediting the upgrading of our equipment and armaments to help the AFP regarding the problem,” said Dela Rosa. The communist rebel leadership earlier vowed to intensify the campaign against the government following the arrest of some of their peace talks consultants. Their founding leader, Jose Maria Sison, has said rebels should kill one soldier a day, to which the President responded by saying that he will order five terrorists killed for every life taken by the rebels. Last weekend, Duterte ordered the AFP to cancel the $233-million deal with Canada for the purchase of 16 helicopters after its government called for a review on this transaction for fear it might be used against rebels and terrorists. Duterte added if government forces could not use the helicopters against terrorists and rebels, the country must prepare for eventual collapse. He said that he cannot allow the global terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to further contaminate the country. “If I cannot use the gunship and helicopters, then I might as well surrender this government to them,” he said. “That’s the logic. I do not question your logic. Your logic is your logic. My logic is mine. It is based on the realities on the ground.” Duterte said he respects the stand of the Canada, whose government reportedly insisted it would only sell helicopters only for evacuation and emergency purposes and that it cannot be used against anti-insurgency operations. He, likewise, ordered the military not to buy even from the US. “So from here on, now, I am directing Armed Forces of the Philippines since most of the guns, bullets and whatever weapons of war, invariably could be used against the rebels and terrorists. Do not anymore get from Canada or from United States because there are always conditions attached,” he said. The President assured that he does not hate Canada, saying he still respects the values of its people. “I would assure the Canadian people – we are friends, we do not hate you, we love Canadians because there are a lot of Filipinos there,” Duterte said. “We respect the policy of the Canadian people, well and good. Do not buy anything that has something to do with arms,” Duterte said. “But if you need cosmetics, you want to be beautiful at beauty products, okay, you can buy them,” he added. Duterte said he opposes any condition that would restrict the use of helicopters in combating terrorists and communist rebels in the country. Meanwhile, only the AFP and the PNP are authorized to buy high-powered guns in the country. The President has prohibited gun stores from selling high-powered firearms even to government officials, saying such weapons must be returned to the national police headquarters. “I am ordering also the police to control the sale of – all gun stores are no longer allowed to sell high-powered guns, even to governors and mayors. Only the military and police can buy,” Duterte said. “And they should be taken off their shelf and returned to (Camp) Crame and that must be reflected there kung sinong nagbili, sinong tao, anong ranggo, saang unit [the buyer, rank, and unit],” he added. The President has sought to tighten gun purchase in the country to prevent the guns from falling into enemy hands. (With a report from Genalyn D.

"Inmate on leave kills three in Belgium, setting off terror probe","May 31, 2018 LIEGE (AP) – A knife-wielding prison inmate on a 48-hour leave stabbed two police officers on Tuesday in the Belgian city of Liege, seized their service weapons and shot them and a bystander to death before being mowed down by a group of officers, setting off a major terror investigation into the country’s most savage assault since 2016 suicide attacks. Prime Minister Charles Michel acknowledged the assailant, who had a lengthy criminal record that included theft, assault and drug offences, had appeared in three reports on radicalism but was still allowed to take a leave from prison. “Is our system working when we see that these kind of people are running free?” asked Vice Premier Alexander De Croo, echoing the thoughts of many in a nation where armed police and gun-toting soldiers still patrol the streets in the wake of the March 2016 attacks that left 32 people dead at the Brussels airport and subway system. Tuesday’s attack happened outside a cafe in the eastern city of Liege when the assailant crept up on the two female officers from behind and stabbed them repeatedly. “He then took their weapons. He used the weapons on the officers, who died,” the Liege prosecutor’s spokesman, Philippe Dulieu, told reporters. Forensic police work at the scene of a shooting in Liege, Belgium on May 29. – AP Dulieu said the attacker then shot and killed a 22-year-old teacher in a vehicle that was leaving a parking lot outside a nearby high school. He then took two women hostage inside the school before confronting police massed outside. “He came out firing at police, wounding a number of them, notably in the legs. He was shot dead,” the spokesman said, adding that the hostages escaped unharmed. Justice Minister Koen Geens described the assailant as a repeat offender who had been incarcerated since 2003 and was due for release in two years. Police Chief Christian Beaupere said “the goal of the attacker was to target the police”. He identified the slain officers as 45-year-old Lucile Garcia and 53-year-old Soraya Belkacemi. He said Belkacemi was the mother of 13-year-old twin daughters who had lost their father, also a police officer. Four other officers were wounded in the attack, one seriously with a severed femoral artery. Belgian media identified the suspect as Benjamin Herman, a Belgian national born in 1982, though in keeping with standard procedure authorities declined to confirm his identity. Interior Minister Jan Jambon said authorities were also investigating the suspected killing on Monday of an old acquaintance of the assailant and said there could be a link. “It is a serious hypothesis,” he told the VRT network. Michel said the suspect in Tuesday’s attack was indirectly mentioned in state security reports on radicalisation. But, the Prime Minister added, the reference was “in notes that did not primarily target him, but others or other situations”, and he was not on a list of suspects maintained by the main OCAD anti-terror assessment group. Belgium’s crisis centre said the country’s terror threat alert would not be raised and remained at level two out of four. It briefly stood at a maximum four shortly after the 2016 attacks. Belgium’s King Philippe, Michel and the country’s justice and interior ministers travelled to Liege to confer with local officials. “I want to offer my government’s support for the victims, for the victims’ families,” Michel said. It was not the first time Liege was hit by a violent attack. In December 2011, a man with a history of weapons and drug offences hurled hand grenades into a square filled with shoppers then opened fire on those who tried to escape. Five people were killed, including the assailant."
"Citizens urged to remain vigilant, build strong cooperation to avert terror attack","CAMP BANCASI, Butuan City – The area command of the Army’s Northeastern and Northern Mindanao Fourth Infantry (Diamond) Division (4th ID) urged citizens to remain vigilant and build strong cooperation with the authorities to avert future terror attacks. Quoting the statement of the 4th ID chief Maj. Gen. Ronald C. Villanueva, 1st Lt. Tere Ingente, chief of Public Affairs Office (PAO) of 4th ID, said “the fight against terror is not just the work of the authorities.” It is “everyone’s responsibility” to keep every citizen safe and secure, the 4th ID PAO officer said. “We must help one another,” Lt. Ingente stressed in an exclusive interview with The Manila Bulletin on Thursday. She said, “any individual must build a strong cooperation with the authorities, by way of immediately reporting to the nearest police station or army detachment of any suspicious character or even grouping.” She said the 4th ID chief has a strong message in saying, “Everybody has a vital role to play.” Ingente said all field units have been instructed to continue conduct target-hardening measures in their respective areas, for the safety of villagers. The 4th “Diamond” Division appealed for public cooperation and asked residents to report suspicious people, she said. “Dako ug ikatabang ang kooperasyon sa mga tao sa amo para mabantayan ang mga lugar sa duha ka region (The cooperation of the public is a big help to us in securing the two regions),” 1st Lt. Ingente pointed out. The area command of the 4th ID issued the statement on Thursday following the bloody terror attack on Tuesday where 3 innocent civilians were killed while more than 30 other persons were injured in Isulan, Sultan Kudarat province. The 4th ID ordered all field units spread in the Northeastern and Northern Mindanao region’s to help their police counterparts in their mobile checkpoints to guard against lawless elements carrying explosives or improvised bombs. All field units also ordered to continue their Focus Military Operations (FMO) in their respective areas of responsibility (AORs) against communist terrorists, while also ready to accept those rebels who wanted to lay down their arms and avail the government’s peace and development program, 1st Lt. Ingente said. “Actually, our field units never lowered their guards since our Commander-In-Chief President Duterte declared martial law in the whole island of Mindanao,” she added."
Three charged over alleged terror plot in Melbourne,"Melbourne?Three men who allegedly plotted “chilling” terror attacks in Melbourne were charged early Tuesday, less than two weeks after a stabbing rampage inspired by the Islamic State group left two dead in Australia’s second city, police said. The trio, all Australian nationals of Turkish descent, were detained by counter-terror police in overnight raids as they escalated preparations to attack crowded areas of Melbourne, according to police.   The three, two brothers aged 31 and 26 and 21-year-old, were later charged with planning a terrorist action, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison, officials said. Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton said the men were “certainly inspired by ISIS”, the Islamic State group, but had no known links to a specific organization. They had been under investigation since March but had become “more energized” since the IS-inspired stabbing attack in Melbourne on November 9, he said. The men had sought to purchase semi-automatic .22 caliber rifles and police were concerned they could target upcoming Christmas season events that will see huge crowds gathering in the city. “There was a view towards a crowded place, a place where maximum people would be attending, to be able to kill, we allege, as maximum an amount of people as possible,” Ashton told reporters. The group had not yet picked a specific target or time for the attack, and Ashton added that police were confident Tuesday’s arrests had “neutralized any threat to the... community from this group”.  In the November 9 attack, a Somali-born Australian, Hassan Khalif Shire Ali, stabbed and killed one man and wounded two others in a central shopping area before being shot dead by police. Coincidentally, the victim of that attack, Sisto Malaspina, 74, was honored by a state funeral in Melbourne on Tuesday. Hundreds of Melbournians and dignitaries attended a service at Melbourne’s St Patrick’s Cathedral to bid farewell to Malaspina, the beloved owner of a local Italian cafe and a well-known figure on the city’s vibrant restaurant scene.The three arrested men were identified by local media as Ertunc and Samed Eriklioglu, aged 30 and 26 respectively, and Hanifi Halis, 21. Court officials could not immediately confirm their identities. “If we had not acted early in preventing this attack, we’ll allege the consequences would have been chilling, with... a potential significant loss of human life,” said Ian Mccartney, a federal counter-terror police spokesman, in announcing the arrests. Australian police have charged 90 people in relation to 40 counter-terrorism investigations since 2014, when the country’s terror alert level was raised to “probable”.  Melbourne has been the target for a number of attacks and plots. In addition to the November 9 knife rampage, a 28-year-old man was convicted on six counts of murder last week for mowing down dozens of people in the same street in January 2017, and Shire Ali’s brother is in jail awaiting trial for a plot to cause mass casualties last New Year’s in the city’s Federation Square. Shire Ali, like the three men arrested Tuesday, had his passport canceled to keep him from joining ISIS in the Mideast, and Ashton said this may have led to their actions at home. “Unfortunately, the ISIS propaganda machine and that of al-Qaeda promotes this type of activity so when people are prevented from traveling or it’s difficult to get to the conflict zone, often the view will be to change tack and commit an act in the country in which they live,” he said. Police said the probe which led to Tuesday’s arrests had been complicated by the suspects’ use of encrypted messaging applications, prompting the government to renew calls for urgent action on controversial legislation that would allow authorities to break the encryption. Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said nine out of 10 of the high priority intelligence investigations currently underway were being undermined by suspects’ use of encrypted messaging. “That’s an unacceptable risk in this environment,” he said."
"Nobel Peace Prize 2018: Nadia Murad, a former ISIS slave turned laureate"," BAGHDAD (AFP) - Nadia Murad survived the worst cruelties ever inflicted on her people, the Yazidis of Iraq, before becoming a global champion of their cause and being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. On Friday (Oct 5), Murad and Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege were jointly awarded the prize for their ""efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war"", Nobel committee chairman Berit Reiss-Andersen said in unveiling the winners in Oslo. The 25-year-old Murad, her thin, pale face framed by her long brown hair, once lived a quiet life in her village near the mountainous Yazidi stronghold of Sinjar in northern Iraq, close to the border with Syria. But when the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group stormed across swathes of the two countries in 2014, her fate changed forever and her nightmare began. One day in August that year, pick-up trucks bearing the black flag of the militants swept into her village, Kocho. ISIS fighters set about killing the men, taking children captive to train them as fighters and condemning thousands of women to a life of forced labour and sexual slavery. Today, Murad and her friend Lamia Haji Bashar, joint recipients of the European Union's 2016 Sakharov human rights prize, continue the fight for the 3,000 Yazidis who remain missing, presumed still in captivity. ISIS fighters wanted ""to take our honour, but they lost their honour"", said Murad, now a United Nations goodwill ambassador for survivors of human trafficking. It is an evil she personally experienced during a harrowing three months. After being captured by ISIS fighters, Murad was taken by force to Mosul, the de facto ""capital"" of the militant group's self-declared caliphate. During her ordeal, she was held captive and repeatedly gang-raped, tortured and beaten. The militants organised slave markets for selling off the women and girls, and Yazidi women were forced to renounce their religion. For the militants, with their ultra-strict interpretation of Islam, the Yazidis are seen as heretics. The Kurdish-speaking community follows an ancient religion, revering a single God and the ""leader of the angels"", represented by a peacock. Like thousands of Yazidis, Murad was forcibly married to a militant, beaten and forced to wear make-up and tight clothes - an experience she later related in front of the United Nations Security Council. ""The first thing they did was they forced us to covert to Islam"", Murad told AFP in 2016. Shocked by the violence, Murad set about trying to escape, and managed to flee with the help of a Muslim family from Mosul. Armed with false identity papers, she managed to cross the few dozen kilometres to Iraqi Kurdistan, joining crowds of other displaced Yazidis in camps. There, she learnt that six of her brothers and her mother had been killed. With the help of an organisation that assists Yazidis, she joined her sister in Germany, where she lives today. She has since dedicated herself to what she calls ""our peoples' fight"", becoming a well-known spokesman even before the #MeToo movement swept the world. The Yazidis numbered around 550,000 in Iraq before 2014, but some 100,000 have since left the country. Many others have fled and remain in Iraqi Kurdistan, reluctant to return to their traditional lands. Slight and soft-spoken, Murad has now become a global voice, campaigning for justice for her people and for the acts committed by the militants to be recognised internationally as genocide. And she and the Yazidis have won a high-profile supporter - Lebanese-British lawyer and rights activist Amal Clooney, who also penned the foreword to Murad's book The Last Girl, published in 2017. The same year, the UN Security Council committed to helping Iraq gather evidence of ISIS crimes. Yet in contrast to all the tragedies that have befallen her, recent pictures on Murad's Twitter feed show happier times. In August, she announced her engagement to fellow Yazidi activist Abid Shamdeen. ""The struggle of our people brought us together & we will continue this path together,"" she wrote. Underneath, a photo showed her next to a young man in a bow tie, her face still framed by her long brown hair, but this time, bearing a broad smile."
 Duterte fears spread of terrorism outside Mindanao," President Duterte expressed hope that the threat of terrorism will not go out Mindanao as he said that the government will find it difficult to address the situation, especially if war breaks out in more than one area. Duterte made the statement days after the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and Philippine National Police (PNP) announced the recent arrests of individuals allegedly link to the Islamic State (ISIS). The President, in a speech in Tarlac City Wednesday, also again floated the idea of arming civilians in case war breaks out in many areas in the Philippines, especially outside Mindanao. “This is hypothetical, I don’t want to scare you, but if you do it in the Visayas or Mindanao in three or four places simultaneously, mahihirapan po tayo (it will be very hard for us). It’s going to be bloody, very, very bloody,” Duterte said. “If hell breaks loose, I’d have to consult the military and maybe I will allow you to own high-powered guns. That is a far-fetched idea. I hope the trouble will be contained in Mindanao only,” he added. The Philippines dealt with ISIS elements, led by the Maute Group, as they laid siege in Marawi City, Lanao del Sur from May to October, 2017. The war prompted Duterte to declare martial law in the entire island in Mindanao for 60 days initially, until Congress granted its two extensions. The martial law in Mindanao will remain effective until the end of 2018. But four months after the government was able to quell the war in Marawi City, the military reported that the Islamic State may have already delegated a new leader in Southeast Asia, following the death of their emir Isnilon Hapilon during the war. Last week, Malacañang welcomed as a positive development in its campaign against terrorism the inclusion of the Maute Group in the United States of America (USA) State Department’s list of foreign terrorist organizations. The Maute Group is now one of the seven Islamic State (ISIS)-affiliate groups listed by the State Department as a terrorist organization from the Philippines, Bangladesh, Egypt, Somalia, Tunisia, and West Africa. “Terrorism, indeed, knows no borders and the inclusion of the Maute Group in the list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists and Foreign Terrorist Organizations as an affiliate group of ISIS shows the solidarity and resolve of the international community to flush out evil forces to make the world safe and secure,” The Palace said in a statement. In a statement posted in its website, the the State Department said that it “has designated three ISIS-affiliated groups – ISIS-West Africa, ISIS-Philippines, and ISIS-Bangladesh – as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs) under Section 1(b) of Executive Order (E.O.) 13224 and as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) pursuant to Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.” “The Department has also designated four other ISIS-affiliated groups and two ISIS-affiliated leaders as SDGTs under Section 1(b) of E.O. 13224. The groups are ISIS-Somalia, Jund al-Khilafah-Tunisia, ISIS-Egypt, and the Maute Group, and the individuals are Mahad Moalim and Abu Musab al-Barnawi,” the US top diplomatic agency added. In including ISIS-Philippines and the Maute Group, the State Department noted ISIS’s video of militants in the Philippines pledging allegiance to ISIS in June, 2016. The State Department also noted of the Maute Group’s declaration of their allegiance to ISIS in 2014 and for being an integral part of ISIS-Philippines. “The Maute Group is responsible for the siege of the City of Marawi in the Philippines, which began in May 2017; the September 2016 Davao market bombing, which killed 15 people and wounded 70 others; and the attempted bomb attack in November 2016 near the US Embassy in Manila,” the US State Department said."
Palace welcomes Maute group’s inclusion list of terror groups ,"By Roy C. Mabasa and Argyll Cyrus B. Geducos The Philippines welcomed the designation on Wednesday by the US State Department of ISIS-Philippines and the Maute Group as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs) and as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO). The State Department labeled ISIS-Philippines and the Maute Group, along with two other ISIS-affiliated groups – ISIS-West Africa and ISIS-Bangladesh–as SDGTs pursuant to Executive Order (EO) 13224 and as FTO pursuant to Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. EO 13224 was issued by US President George W. Bush on September 23, 2001, as a response to the 9/11 attacks and which targets terrorists and those providing support to terrorists or acts of terrorism. It imposes strict sanctions on foreign persons determined to have committed, or pose a significant risk of committing, acts of terrorism that threaten the security of US nationals or the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the US. As a result of these designations, US persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with ISIS-Philippines and the Maute Group. The groups’ property and interests in property subject to US jurisdiction are also blocked. In addition, it is a crime to knowingly provide, or attempt or conspire to provide, material support or resources to the said organizations. The Maute Group is one of seven Islamic State (ISIS)-affiliate groups listed by the State Department as terrorist organizations from the Philippines, Bangladesh, Egypt, Somalia, Tunisia, and West Africa. According to Presidential spokesman Harry Roque, the development proves the Philippine government’s belief that the Maute Group is being aided by foreign elements. “The official designation of the Maute Group as an affiliate group of ISIS and its inclusion in the US list of foreign terrorist organizations are positive developments in the campaign against terrorism,”Roque said in a statement Wednesday afternoon. “This reaffirms our long-held belief that the Maute Group is composed of local terrorists aided by foreign extremists,” he added. The Palace official also said that the official designation recognizes the Philippine government’s actions against the Maute Group when they laid a five-month siege in Marawi City, Lanaodel Sur, from May to October, 2017. “This likewise recognizes the decisive action we have taken in liberating Marawi from these terrorists, which resulted in the success of the government in thwarting the establishment of an Islamic caliphate in the area and the containing of the rebellion from spreading to other parts of the Philippines,”Roque said. “Terrorism, indeed, knows no borders and the inclusion of the Maute Group in the list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists and Foreign Terrorist Organizations as an affiliate group of ISIS shows the solidarity and resolve of the international community to flush out evil forces to make the world safe and secure,” he added. “The Department has also designated four other ISIS-affiliated groups and two ISIS-affiliated leaders as SDGTs under Section 1(b) of E.O. 13224. The groups are ISIS-Somalia, Jund al-Khilafah-Tunisia, ISIS-Egypt, and the Maute Group, and the individuals are MahadMoalim and Abu Musab al-Barnawi,” the US top diplomatic agency added. E.O. 13224 imposes strict sanctions on foreign persons determined to have committed, or pose a significant risk of committing, acts of terrorism that threaten the security of US nationals or the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States. In including ISIS-Philippines and the Maute Group, the State Department noted ISIS’s video of militants in the Philippines pledging allegiance to ISIS in June, 2016. “In the video, militants encouraged other Muslims to join the terrorist group and support ISIS’s efforts in the region under the command of now-deceased SDGT Isnilon Hapilon – recognized by ISIS as the leader of ISIS-Philippines,” it said. The State Department also noted the Maute Group’s declaration of their allegiance to ISIS in 2014 and for being an integral part of ISIS-Philippines. “The Maute Group is responsible for the siege of the City of Marawi in the Philippines, which began in May, 2017; the September, 2016 Davao market bombing, which killed 15 people and wounded 70 others; and the attempted bomb attack in November, 2016, near the US embassy in Manila,” it added. The Maute Group, also known as the Islamic State of Lanao, is a radical Islamist group composed of former Moro Islamic Liberation Front guerrillas and foreign fighters led by Abdullah Maute, the alleged founder of a DawlahIslamiya, or Islamic state based in Lanaodel Sur. In a statement, Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Ernesto Abella said the Philippine government is “profoundly committed to preventing ISIS from gaining foothold in the Philippines and in Southeast Asia.” “Terrorism is a global and regional challenge, and cooperation with key allies is critical in averting terrorist operations,” said Abella. “While we have concluded a successful campaign in Marawi against the Maute group, countering terrorism continues to be a priority of this administration.”"
Indonesian duo in terror plot face death penalty,"A former Indonesian migrant worker who was deported from Hong Kong last year after she posted a Facebook video of her pledging allegiance to Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is now facing the death sentence along with her newly wed husband for terror-related offences at home. Both are facing charges in connection with planning terror attacks and making explosives in a rented house in Bandung. ""Anggi Indah Kusuma alias Khanza Syafiyah al-Fuqron has committed evil conspiracy, consciously tried to or assisted (others) to carry out terror acts. She has made and stored explosives with the intention to launch terror acts,"" stated court documents seen by The Straits Times. Anggi, 24, returned to Indonesia in March last year and was immediately interrogated by police. She was subsequently sent to a Social Affairs Ministry rehabilitation centre before being allowed to go home to her parents in Klaten, Central Java. But in May last year, Anggi fled home and married another migrant worker, Adilatul Rahman alias Rahman Factory, who had returned home from Malaysia. Her parents disapproved of the marriage. Anggi was introduced to Rahman on Facebook while she was in Hong Kong and, after their marriage, the couple moved to Bandung, West Java. Less than three months after their wedding, on Aug 15 last year, Anggi and Rahman were nabbed during simultaneous raids by Densus 88, the elite counter-terrorism unit, on three places in Bandung. Three of their accomplices were also picked up. All those arrested were allegedly members of a terror cell manufacturing homemade chemical bombs to be used to attack the presidential palace in Jakarta, the police mobile brigade squad headquarters outside Jakarta and state-owned weapons manufacturer PT Pindad. Court documents said that in early August, Rahman and an accomplice, Young Farmer alias Abu Nakir Shaab, went to a chemical store in Bandung to procure bomb-making materials but could not get any because the store required identification from the buyers, who also had to certify their use. The men then resorted to a popular local online marketplace, procured the materials and had them delivered on Aug 11 to the rented house in Bandung. The couple as well as their accomplices then began the process of making a bomb using a manual provided by Young Farmer, whose real name has not been established yet. The court was told that while making the bomb, everyone was shocked by thick smoke and a strong odour in a room in Rahman's house. Anggi, who was then pregnant, was nauseous. The decision was then taken to move the process to Young Farmer's house, also in Bandung. Counter-terrorism officials said Anggi was radicalised while in Hong Kong after she befriended two men, Musa Wisesa and Abu Alqosam al-Ajeneseh, who indoctrinated her on Islamic syariah law and the ISIS caliphate. The court documents did not provide further details about the two men but said that not long after Anggi befriended them, she pledged allegiance to al-Baghdadi in a Hong Kong park. A fellow Indonesian videotaped her reading a text provided by Abu Alqosam, and Anggi then uploaded the footage to her Facebook account. She also uploaded a write-up, professing her radical ideology. Anggi was a member of several radical chat groups on Telegram."
Husband and wife face death penalty on terror charges in Indonesia,"JAKARTA - A former Indonesian migrant worker, who last year was deported from Hong Kong after she posted a Facebook video of her pledging allegiance to Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is now facing the death sentence along with her newly-wed husband for planning terror attacks and making explosives in a rented house in Bandung. ""Anggi Indah Kusuma alias Khanza Syafiyah al-Fuqron has committed evil conspiracy, consciously tried to or assisted (others) to carry out terror acts. She has made and stored explosives with the intention to launch terror acts,"" said court documents seen by The Straits Times. Anggi, 24, returned to Indonesia in March 2017, and was immediately interrogated by police. She was subsequently sent to a social affairs ministry rehabilitation centre before being allowed to go home to her parents in Klaten, Central Java. But, in May last year, Anggi fled home and married another migrant worker, Rahman Factory, who had returned home from Malaysia. Her parents disapproved of the marriage. Anggi was first introduced to Rahman on Facebook while she was in Hong Kong and, after their marriage, the couple moved to Bandung,  in West Java. Less than three months after their wedding, on Aug 15, 2017, Anggi and Rahman were nabbed during simultaneous raids by Densus 88, the elite counter-terrorism unit, on three places in Bandung. Three of their alleged accomplices were also picked up. All of those arrested were allegedly members of a terror cell, who were manufacturing home-made chemical bombs to be used to attack the presidential palace in Jakarta, the police mobile brigade squad headquarters outside Jakarta and state-owned weapons manufacturer PT Pindad. Court documents said that, in early August, Rahman and an accomplice, Young Farmer alias Abu Nakir Shaab , went to a chemical store in Bandung to procure bomb-making materials but could not get hold of any because the store required identification from the buyers who also had to certify their use. The men then resorted to a popular local online marketplace, procured the materials and had them delivered on Aug 11 to the rented house in Bandung. The couple as well and their accomplices then began the process of making a bomb using a manual provided by Young Farmer, whose real name has not been established yet. The court was told that, while making the bomb, everyone was shocked by thick smoke and strong odour in the room of Rahman's house. Anggi, who was then pregnant, was nauseous. The decision was then taken to move the process to Young Farmer's house, also in Bandung. Counter-terrorism officials said Anggi was radicalised while in Hong Kong after she befriended two men, Musa Wisesa and Abu Alqosam al-Ajeneseh, who indoctrinated her on Islamic sharia law and the ISIS caliphate. The court documents did not provide further details about the two men but said that not long after Anggi befriended them she pledged allegiance to al-Baghdadi at Yuen park, in Hongkong. A fellow Indonesian videotaped her reading a text provided by Abu Alqosam and Anggi then uploaded the footage to her Facebook account. She also uploaded a write-up, professing her radical ideology. Anggi then created a chatgroup on her Telegram mobile messaging account and called it ""Redaksi Khilafah"" (Caliphate Editorial). It eventually had 86 members. Anggi was also a member in seven other radical Telegram chat groups."
 3 stabbed in Melbourne terror attack," MELBOURNE • A knife-wielding man set fire to a pickup truck laden with gas cylinders in the Australian city of Melbourne yesterday and stabbed three people, killing one, before he was shot by police. Police called the rampage an act of terrorism, while the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) claimed responsibility for the attack. The truck carrying barbecue gas cylinders burned on busy Bourke Street just before the evening rush hour as the driver stabbed bystanders and attacked police. The cylinders did not explode and the fire was put out in 10 minutes, by which point the attack was over. ""We are still trying to piece together whether the vehicle was lit, then he got out the car or whether he got out the car and then the vehicle took flame,"" said Victoria Police Commissioner Graham Ashton. Video posted on Twitter and broadcast on television showed the man swinging a knife at two police officers, while his utility truck burned in the background. One of the officers shot the man and he collapsed to the ground clutching his chest, the video showed. Other footage showed two stab victims lying on the ground. The attacker, said to be a Somali-born man aged 31, died in hospital, as did one of the victims. Mr Ashton said: ""From what we know of that individual, we are treating this as a terrorism incident."" Asked about what the attacker had been planning, Mr Ashton referred to the gas cylinders in the truck and said: ""You could make certain assumptions from that."" Victoria police declined to comment when contacted about the ISIS claim. The militant group also claimed responsibility for a deadly siege in the city in 2017 when a Somali man was killed by police after taking a woman hostage. Mr Ashton said there was no longer a threat to the public, but that security would be boosted at horse races and Remembrance Day memorials over the weekend. Police did not identify the attacker but Mr Ashton said the man was known to them and the intelligence authorities. Mr Ashton declined to release the names of the victims, all male, because police were still in the process of contacting their families. Police later said the two wounded men were aged 26 and 58. Asked if the attacker had recently travelled to Syria, he said: ""That is something we might be able to talk more about tomorrow."" A staunch US ally, Australia has been on alert for such violence after a Sydney cafe siege in 2014, and its intelligence agencies have stepped up scrutiny, though there was no warning of the latest attack. The authorities say Australia's vigilance has helped it to foil at least a dozen plots, including a plan to attack downtown Melbourne at Christmas in 2016. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement released on Twitter: ""Australia will never be intimidated by these appalling attacks."" Video on social media showed chaotic scenes as bystanders scattered while the attacker fought with police and his victims lay bleeding on the footpath. One man charged at the attacker, who was wearing a long black shirt, with a shopping trolley just before police drew their weapons. Victoria's Premier Daniel Andrews said the attack was ""an evil, terrifying thing"". A fatal but not terror-related attack took place on the same street last year, after a man drove his car at pedestrians, killing six people and wounding dozens. That prompted the city to install hundreds of security bollards. In December 2014, two hostages were killed during a 17-hour siege by a ""lone wolf"" gunman in a cafe in Sydney."
Jakarta minister cites Marawi siege to stress sharing of intelligence,"Precious lives could have been saved if government agencies and ministries within the region had shared and exchanged quality intelligence during the May 2017 siege of Marawi in the Philippines. The incident could have been prevented or even pre-empted, Indonesia's Defence Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu said yesterday in his keynote address at the opening of the 2018 South-east Asia Counter-Terrorism Symposium: A Collective Approach. ""The siege of Marawi demonstrated that our region was unprepared for the current and emerging wave of terrorism,"" said the retired general. ""It also demonstrated the need for a new security architecture for the Asean region."" Mr Ryamizard was one of four guest speakers at the event organised by the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS). The two-day symposium at the Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel was organised as part of Singapore's Asean chairmanship. The Marawi attack by Filipino militants aligned with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group was cited by the minister to highlight lapses in intelligence sharing. ""Regional governments were culpable for not exchanging intelligence sufficiently to prevent the fall of Marawi city to IS (ISIS). Even after the siege of Marawi, the flow of intelligence was absent, partial or flawed,"" he said. The siege lasted five months, resulting in more than 900 militants being captured or killed. While ISIS may have been defeated in the Middle East last year, the threat of terrorism remains a key challenge in South-east Asia. Today, 63 terror groups in Southeast Asia have pledged allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi. On May 13, there were multiple suicide attacks involving entire families - including women and children - in the Indonesian city of Surabaya. Recently uncovered plots revealed plans by terrorists to make anthrax and botulinum in Malaysia, and ricin and thorium in Indonesia. Mr Ryamizard added that the July 31 suicide bombing in Basilan in the Philippines by a Moroccan terrorist was ""the most significant recent attack"". Asean is trying to get its act together. On Jan 25, six nations from the region formally launched the Our Eyes Initiative in Bali to share intelligence among themselves. The idea for this originated when he visited RSIS in July last year, Mr Ryamizard said. ""Evil will spread when good men do nothing. We have to do something (to fight terrorism),"" he said. Mr Ryamizard added that meeting Singapore's Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam gave him confidence to build a collaborative intelligence platform. In the end, the defence ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Brunei agreed to establish a joint working group, with plans to include more nations later. The new pact would create a common database, facilitate the exchange of personnel, and share expertise, resources and experiences, including conducting joint training and operations. Still, returning ISIS fighters continue to be one of the current concerns, said Ambassador-at-Large Ong Keng Yong, executive deputy chairman of RSIS. Unlike Al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiah, ISIS has capitalised on the use of cyberspace to spread its violent message. ""ISIS operatives, sympathisers, fanboys and fangirls have benefited greatly from the use of the darker corners of the Internet,"" Mr Ong said in his opening remarks. Philippine Undersecretary of National Defence Cardozo Luna said the recent terrorist attacks in South-east Asia have shown patterns of ""radicalisation, sources of terror financing and technological and tactical sophistication"". ""Daesh (ISIS) has been able to provide occasional money transfers to the Maute group (involved in the Marawi attack) using electronic transfers,"" said Mr Luna."

Pope condemns bombing of Philippines cathedral as 'terrorist attack',"PANAMA CITY, Jan 28 — Pope Francis yesterday condemned the twin bombings that killed at least 20 people during a Catholic Church service in the Philippines as a “terrorist attack” and prayed that God would convert the hearts of those who carried it out. The attack also wounded 81 and was one of the deadliest in recent years in a region long plagued by instability. Francis, speaking at a hospice for AIDS sufferers on the last day of his trip here, expressed his ""firm condemnation of this act of violence that causes more mourning in the Christian community. I pray for the dead and the injured. May the Lord, prince of peace, convert the hearts of the violent ones."" There was no immediate claim of responsibility but police suspect the bombings were the work of Abu Sayyaf, a militant group that has pledged allegiance to Islamic State and is notorious for its bombings and brutality. The first explosion went off inside the cathedral on Jolo Island in Sulu Province, and was followed by a second blast outside, which was detonated as security forces raced to the scene, officials said. The pope visited the Philippines, the most Catholic country in Asia, in 2015."
"Philippines, Jordan unite in fight against terrorism","AMMAN — The Philippines and Jordan have vowed to unite in the fight against terrorism as they admitted that the threat posed by extremists may not be quelled anytime soon. President Rodrigo Duterte and Jordanian King Abdullah II stressed that terrorism is a ""scourge"" and an ""evil"" that is threatening their countries' security and causing suffering to people in their regions. ""I think one of the main things that bind us together is the scourge of terrorism which is a challenge for our region and your region, for your country and my country....the international cooperation and coordination...is now becoming much more apparent because this is an issue that’s going to last with us not only for the next five to ten, 15 years,"" King ABdullah said during his bilateral meeting with Duterte. ""It’s going to take us a while to overcome the...mentalities that these very horrible evil people perpetrated in your region and in mine,"" he added. Duterte, the first sitting Philippine president to visit Jordan, agreed that terrorism cannot be defeated easily but expressed hope that the next generation would be able to ""live comfortably."" He said the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the extremist group that threatens Jordan's borders, has been establishing operational hubs in Mindanao, which is till grappling with a decades-old Muslim insurgency. ""Terrorism is the scourge of mankind today and it will take us about a lot more years to stop it,"" the president said. Duterte thanked Abdullah for providing military equipment to the Philippines and promised to boost the Philippines' friendship with Jordan. Jordan has agreed to provide two used Cobra attack helicopters to the Philippines, a development that officials said would enhance the military's drive against terrorism and other security threats. The two helicopters are expected to be delivered in July next year after the nine-month training of Filipino pilots. Jordan also vowed to provide brand-new rifles, mortars, and rocket-propelled grenades. In a business forum held hours after his working lunch with King Andullah, Duterte expressed readiness to provide Jordan troops if needed. ""I'll leave you my guarantee that we will be friends and we will nurse and nurture it fully so that someday my people can really say that you paved the way for the good relationship. If you are short of your army, let me know,"" he said. ""You need one battalion? Two, three, four, five? I'll send them to you. So no problem. I will commit my government in the right side of history. The right side of history is that you are fair and that you can understand the problems of humanity and that you realize that you need as much as I need you in order to (work) this place called Earth, beautiful and working for all of us,"" he added.

Martial law not effective in combating terrorism in Mindanao — US Dept. of State official,"WASHINGTON DC— The imposition of martial law may be making places like Mindanao in the Philippines more vulnerable to terrorism and creating safe havens for extremists, a US Department of State official told visiting journalists here on Wednesday. Irfan Saeed, director of the Office of Countering Violent Extremism under the State Department’s Bureau of Counterterrorism and Countering Violent Terrorism, said a community approach, rather than a military approach, might be a better tool at a time when Islamic State fighters were turning to Southeast Asia as a refuge for their activities. Asked by the Inquirer if martial law was effective in combating terrorism in Mindanao, he said: “No. That is the short answer.” “The response to terrorism and our efforts in countering violent extremism cannot be an excuse for an overly aggressive law enforcement approach,” he said during a briefing for the 2018 East-West Center’s Seminar for Senior Journalists. “We’ve learned very clearly that this suppression of basic human rights, of civil liberties of the things that are required of countries under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, if you violate those basic human rights and liberties, you’re actually bringing a greater ability to recruit people to violent extremism,” Saeed said. “We have seen the suppression of basic human rights as a potential driver of terrorism,” he added. He said the Philippines, especially Mindanao, was at a pivotal point considering the risks it faced from ISIS recruits. “The Philippines is a very important place… as we start to look at the next iteration of ISIS and terrorist spiders,” he said. Saeed said the more appropriate approach would be to make communities more aware of their responsibility to deny terrorists safe havens, especially in areas with no military response, such as Southeast Asia, Pakistan, and the Balkans. “Because when you have a government only responsible for denying those safe havens, you have the possibility of an overly aggressive approach, and that, as we know, does not work,” he said. Mindanao has been under martial law since mid-2017 in the aftermath of the May 2017 siege of Marawi City by militants. Congress later approved two extensions of military rule and the suspension of the writ of the privilege of habeas corpus in the region. However, violent attacks still happened in Mindanao in recent months despite the declaration of martial law. In late August, terrorists set off homemade bombs that killed at least two persons and injured dozens of others in Isulan town, Sultan Kudarat. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, according to a US intelligence group. On July 31, at least 10 people were killed and several others wounded when a van exploded outside a checkpoint in the Island city of Lamitan in Basilan. Instead of returning to their home countries upon radicalization, “we’re starting to see people return to third countries where they feel like they can have safe havens,” he said. “And unfortunately, places across Southeast Asia, but in particular the Philippines— we know the attack in Marawi — this is where we are starting to have some very clear concerns about safe havens,” Saeed said. The seminar organized by the Honolulu-based East-West Center is an annual fellowship for journalists in the US and countries with substantial Muslim populations, who go on a three-week tour of US, Asia, and Africa to study the role of religion in the public sphere."
"PH, Jordan denounce terrorism"," AMMAN, Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan — President Duterte thanked Jordan King Abdullah II for the arms that the Kingdom is going to provide the Philippines in order to boost its defense capabilities. Duterte made the statement during his working lunch with the Jordanian monarch when he visited the Al Husseiniya Palace in Amman Thursday afternoon (Jordan time). Duterte told Abdullah that the arms that will be given to the Philippines will be of great help. “And of course, our concern against terrorism which brings us here the — well of course what we have discussed, the arms that would be of great help. If there’s any value, it is of value and the friendship that goes with it,” he said. Special Assistant to the President Christopher Go earlier confirmed that Jordan will be turning over to the Philippines two second-hand Cobra attack helicopters in July next year after the training of Filipino pilots. Go also said that Jordan will also be giving the Philippines mortars, rifles, and rocket-propelled grenades. Terrorism far from over Both Duterte and Abdullah also agreed that it will take a long time before terrorism would be completely purged. Abdullah told Duterte that it will take not only the next 10 to 15 years to overcome the influence of “horrible” people in the southeast and western Asia. “Over the past several months, if not the past year or two, the cooperation between our two countries to fight the evil that you have to suffer within your country as we suffer in ours, I think is a testament to the international cooperation and coordination that is now becoming much more apparent,” the King said. “This is an issue that’s going to last with us not only for the next five to 10, 15 years as you are trying very hard to be very quick, but it’s going to take us a while to overcome the mentalities that these very horrible people perpetrated in your region and in mine,” he added. Duterte agreed that it will take a long time before terrorism could be quelled, but hopes that the next generation would not be able to experience any terrorist act. “And terrorism is the scourge of mankind today and it will take us about a lot more years to stop it. I really do not know how long,” Duterte told Abdullah. “God’s will. But Insha’Allah, I hope that it will — maybe… Not so much for this generation but for the next generation for them to live comfortably,” he added. Duterte also told Abdullah that the Islamic State (ISIS) would most likely be targeting the Philippines if they are running out of territory in the Middle East. “There’s a lot of activity sponsored by the ISIS. If they’re running out of ground here in the Middle East and if they look to find ways, maybe transfer their headquarter, they would choose Southeast Asia and Mindanao, it’s a place where… where there’s a lot of our Muslim brothers and Christian sisters live there,” he said. The Philippine government was able to overcome the strength of pro-ISIS terrorists when it laid siege in Marawi City, Lanao del Sur for five months from May last year."
‘I saw everything flying’,"ISULAN, SULTAN KUDARAT—“I saw everything flying,” Francis Suerte, 26, said, describing the chaos at a used-clothing store at the time of the bomb blast that tore through a crowd at a night market in Kalawag 3 village here on Tuesday night, killing two people, including a young girl, and wounding 35 others. “The explosion was very powerful, the ground was shaking, used clothing and everything flying, people were running in different directions,” said Suerte, who sustained shrapnel injuries on both legs. Seconds before he was hit, he said, a militiaman saw a man put a bag under a parked motorbike, only 3 meters from where he stood. When the militiaman called the man’s attention, the man ran away. Other militiamen gave chase, but the man jumped on a waiting motorbike driven by an accomplice and the two sped away. Just then, an explosion ripped through the place, felling everyone within 50 meters of the blast site, Isulan Mayor Marites Pallasigue said. “Pandemonium broke loose and every one near the parked motorbike were yelling for help,” said Suerte, a resident of Sen. Ninoy Aquino town in Sultan Kudarat who considered himself lucky because his injuries were not fatal. “I dropped and crawled my way out of the pile of used clothing,” Suerte said. “I saw a girl lying in a pool of blood right after the blast, I think she died,” he said in Filipino. Lenie Ombrog, 52, of Barangay Kalawag, was killed outright, while Davy Shane Alayon, 7, who lived in Bagumbayan town, Sultan Kudarat, died in the hospital on Wednesday morning, said Supt. Aldrin Gonzales, speaking for the regional police. Among the injured were Sgt. Timjar Hambali and M/Sgt. Jo Capilitan, both of the Army’s 33rd Infantry Battalion, and Protestant pastor Raymund Malves, 60. “Most of the victims are already out of the hospital,” Pallasigue said. “Only those with serious leg injuries remain at Sultan Kudarat Provincial Hospital,” she added. She said two of those people were in critical condition. Malacañang condemned the attack and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice. “Authorities are now investigating the incident and we vow to bring the perpetrators of this brazen attack to justice. We will apply the full force of the law,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said. Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea said extending martial law in Mindanao was an option that the government was considering after the attack in Isulan. Mindanao has been under martial law since May 2017, when local terrorists who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) jihadi group in the Middle East seized Marawi City. Extended by Congress after the seige to allow the military to deal with the remnants of the Maute and Abu Sayyaf groups that held the city for five months, the declaration would lapse on December 31. Senate President Vicente Sotto III said on Wednesday that the attack might be an indication that martial law was not being enforced strictly enough in Mindanao. Still, Sotto said it was premature to discuss whether an extension was necessary, despite the violence. “For all we know, in a month or two, everything that happened there would be resolved already,” he said. Vice President Leni Robredo opposed an extension, saying martial law had failed to stop terrorist attacks in Mindanao. “What assurance do we have that an extension would prevent attacks?” Robredo said. Communist Party of the Philippines founder Jose Maria Sison also opposed an extension, saying the Duterte administration was just looking for a reason to justify the continued enforcement of martial law in Mindanao and attacks on the party’s armed wing, the New People’s Army (NPA). In an online interview from exile in Utrecht, the Netherlands, Sison said NPA fighters would defend themselves against attacks by government forces. The Philippine National Police went on full alert throughout Mindanao and heightened alert in Metropolitan Manila after the bombing. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the largest Muslim insurgency group in Mindanao that has signed a peace agreement with the government, condemned the attack in Isulan, which it said had the signature of IS. “If they look at the kind of signature as well as the way the attack was carried out, it was pointing toward [IS],” MILF chief peace negotiator Mohagher Iqbal said. “We condemn it,” Iqbal said. “It’s the handiwork of bloody minded people and it served no purpose. Those who perpetrated the bombing were peace spoilers.” The blast happened as Isulan celebrated its 61st founding anniversary and a local festival called Hamungaya. No one among the local armed groups claimed responsibility for the blast, but IS did, according to the Maryland-based SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks online activities of white supremacist and jihadi organizations. SITE said the IS East Asia Province claimed bombing Filipino soldiers in Isulan. Chief Insp. Ronnie Dardo, spokesperson for the provincial police, could not confirm that the attack was carried out by IS, but said police had intercepted information about a possible attack by the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) in nearby Maguindanao province. “We believe that the terrorist group BIFF is the primary suspect behind this atrocity,” Col. Noel Detoyato, chief of the public affairs office of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, told a news briefing at Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City. “They are the ones who have the strongest evil desire to initiate this kind of attacks that victimize innocent civilians and disrupt peace,” Detoyato said. In Isulan, Dardo said two other homemade bombs were recovered and defused at the blast site. Capt. Arvin Encinas, spokesperson for the 6th Infantry Division, also blamed the attack on the BIFF and said military operations against the group would continue. “These bomb attacks are part of the BIFF’s retaliation against the military for the losses they suffered at the hands of our troops. It is unfortunate that their retaliation did not spare innocent civilians,” Encinas said by phone. He said that since the start of the year, at least 40 BIFF fighters had been killed in clashes with government troops in Maguindanao and North Cotabato provinces, a claim that could not be independently verified in the absence of actual body counts. In June, Brig. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, 6th Infantry Division commander, said troops dismantled a BIFF bomb-making facility in Maguindanao province. Encinas said the BIFF had splintered into three factions, each with about 60 fighters. The faction led by Abu Turaife has pledged allegiance to IS and is allegedly getting financial support from the jihadi group, he said. The two other factions are led by Commander Bongos and Ustadz Karialan, he said. Abu Misry Mama, spokesperson for the IS-linked faction of the BIFF, said his group was not behind the Isulan bombing. “We have nothing to do with it. We don’t attack civilians,” Mama said by phone. Encinas said Tuesday’s attack in Isulan was believed to have been carried out by two fighters from the Bongos faction. Sultan Kudarat Gov. Pax Mangudadatu offered a P1-million reward for information that would lead to the capture of the perpetrators."
Democrats: Trump needs Congress approval for broader Syria effort," WASHINGTON (AFP) - US President Donald Trump's announcement on Friday (April 13) of air strikes in Syria triggered swift warnings from opposition Democrats that any broader military campaign there would require a well-formulated strategic vision - and authorisation from Congress. Mr Trump said US forces launched ""precision"" strikes against Syrian targets, and that the United States would ""sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents"". House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi led calls for Mr Trump to map out a detailed plan and present it to Congress if he wants to expand military action. ""One night of air strikes is no substitute for a coherent strategy,"" Ms Pelosi said in a statement. Mr Trump ""must come to Congress to obtain a new AUMF (authorisation for use of military force), present a clear set of objectives, & ultimately hold Putin accountable for the bloodshed he has enabled"", she added, referring to President Vladimir Putin of Russia, the Syrian regime's most powerful ally. US military forces have largely been operating under AUMFs passed by Congress shortly after the 9/11 attacks to conduct operations against extremist groups like the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), including in Syria. Some Democrats like Senator Tim Kaine, the party's vice-presidential nominee in 2016, said although last week's deadly apparent chemical attack was an abomination, Mr Trump's air strikes were illegal. ""The last thing Congress should be doing is giving this President a blank check to wage war against anyone, anywhere. We need to put clear limits in place before he starts another war,"" said Mr Kaine. ""Today, it's a strike on Syria - what's going to stop him from bombing Iran or North Korea next?"" Congressman Eric Swalwell reminded that Mr Trump launched missile strikes without congressional approval against a Syrian air field last year. ""What's changed? Zero. They're still using chemical weapons,"" he said. ""This is the result of a failure to have a strategy and engage Middle East countries to solve this problem."" ""The precision targeting of military targets are needed in the fight of good versus evil, a fight of the United States versus the dark edge of humanity,"" Senator Cory Gardner said. ""These offensive strikes against Syria are unconstitutional, illegal, and reckless,"" Mr Amash said, adding that the next House Speaker who succeeds the outgoing Mr Paul Ryan should ""reclaim congressional war powers""."
"Britain, France, and US have marshalled their righteous power against barbarism and brutality: Trump","WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - The following is the full text of US President Donald Trump's remarks on Friday (April 13) announcing military strikes targeting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's chemical weapons capabilities after a poison gas attack that killed at least 60 people last week. THE PRESIDENT: My fellow Americans, a short time ago, I ordered the United States Armed Forces to launch precision strikes on targets associated with the chemical weapons capabilities of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. A combined operation with the armed forces of France and the United Kingdom is now underway. We thank them both. Tonight, I want to speak with you about why we have taken this action. One year ago, Assad launched a savage chemical weapons attack against his own innocent people. The United States responded with 58 missile strikes that destroyed 20 per cent of the Syrian Air Force. Last Saturday, the Assad regime again deployed chemical weapons to slaughter innocent civilians - this time, in the town of Douma, near the Syrian capital of Damascus. This massacre was a significant escalation in a pattern of chemical weapons use by that very terrible regime. The evil and the despicable attack left mothers and fathers, infants and children, thrashing in pain and gasping for air. These are not the actions of a man; they are crimes of a monster instead. Following the horrors of World War I a century ago, civilised nations joined together to ban chemical warfare. Chemical weapons are uniquely dangerous not only because they inflict gruesome suffering, but because even small amounts can unleash widespread devastation. The purpose of our actions tonight is to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread, and use of chemical weapons. Establishing this deterrent is a vital national security interest of the United States. The combined American, British, and French response to these atrocities will integrate all instruments of our national power - military, economic, and diplomatic. We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents. I also have a message tonight for the two governments most responsible for supporting, equipping, and financing the criminal Assad regime. To Iran, and to Russia, I ask: What kind of a nation wants to be associated with the mass murder of innocent men, women, and children? The nations of the world can be judged by the friends they keep. No nation can succeed in the long run by promoting rogue states, brutal tyrants, and murderous dictators. In 2013, President Putin and his government promised the world that they would guarantee the elimination of Syria's chemical weapons. Assad's recent attack - and today's response - are the direct result of Russia's failure to keep that promise. Russia must decide if it will continue down this dark path, or if it will join with civilised nations as a force for stability and peace. Hopefully, someday we'll get along with Russia, and maybe even Iran - but maybe not. I will say this: The United States has a lot to offer, with the greatest and most powerful economy in the history of the world. In Syria, the United States - with but a small force being used to eliminate what is left of ISIS - is doing what is necessary to protect the American people. Over the last year, nearly 100 per cent of the territory once controlled by the so-called ISIS caliphate in Syria and Iraq has been liberated and eliminated. The United States has also rebuilt our friendships across the Middle East. We have asked our partners to take greater responsibility for securing their home region, including contributing large amounts of money for the resources, equipment, and all of the anti-ISIS effort. Increased engagement from our friends, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, and others can ensure that Iran does not profit from the eradication of ISIS. America does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria under no circumstances. As other nations step up their contributions, we look forward to the day when we can bring our warriors home. And great warriors they are. Looking around our very troubled world, Americans have no illusions. We cannot purge the world of evil, or act everywhere there is tyranny. No amount of American blood or treasure can produce lasting peace and security in the Middle East. It's a troubled place. We will try to make it better, but it is a troubled place. The United States will be a partner and a friend, but the fate of the region lies in the hands of its own people. In the last century, we looked straight into the darkest places of the human soul. We saw the anguish that can be unleashed and the evil that can take hold. By the end of the World War I, more than one million people had been killed or injured by chemical weapons. We never want to see that ghastly spectre return. So today, the nations of Britain, France, and the United States of America have marshalled their righteous power against barbarism and brutality. Tonight, I ask all Americans to say a prayer for our noble warriors and our allies as they carry out their missions. We pray that God will bring comfort to those suffering in Syria. We pray that God will guide the whole region toward a future of dignity and of peace. And we pray that God will continue to watch over and bless the United States of America. Thank you, and goodnight. Thank you."
"Asean, Australia sign pact to fight violent extremism","Asean and Australia signed a pact to cooperate on fighting violent extremism and terrorism financing yesterday, as Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull warned that terrorists are using digital technology in innovative ways to finance, plan and conduct their attacks. Under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), Asean and Australia will work together to develop and implement counter-terrorism legislation consistent with international standards and best practices. They will also start a workshop on using electronic evidence in the investigation and prosecution of terrorism and transnational crime. The agreement also paves the way for exchange programmes for financial intelligence analysts and regional forums for Asean and Australian law enforcement agencies. The MOU comes at a time when terrorists increasingly use non-conventional funding methods, including digital currencies, stored value cards and crowdfunding platforms, making it harder to detect terrorism financing, Mr Turnbull noted. It has also become more critical than ever for countries to work together to counter terrorism, as the front line in the battle against this scourge is - in an interconnected world - everywhere, he added. ""We have seen... very, very graphically, where detailed instructions about the preparation of a weapon were transmitted over encrypted applications from Syria to an individual here in Australia,"" he said. ""So we have to be constantly alert, constantly working with our neighbours in the region."" He was speaking at a counter-terrorism conference, where the MOU was signed by Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop and Asean Secretary-General Lim Jock Hoi. The conference took place on the sidelines of the Asean-Australia Special Summit. Mr Turnbull and Asean leaders, including Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, witnessed the signing. Speaking on behalf of Asean leaders, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak urged leaders to fight terrorism on social media. ""This is our new main battleground - to win the hearts and minds of our youth through social media so that they do not easily succumb to the warped, perverse and evil ideology of Daesh,"" he said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Earlier in the day, Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton warned the conference that the use of encrypted messaging apps to plan terror attacks is the greatest threat faced by intelligence agencies. The use of the ""dark web"" by extremists and other criminals is a spiralling problem, he said, referring to the murky back alleys of the Internet, including chat apps, where criminals sell weapons and drugs. ""It would be a mistake to approach the problem from a purely national perspective,"" he said, urging a united and cohesive response. Australian ministers announced various other plans yesterday aimed at boosting ties with Asean, including a new Asean-Australia Infrastructure Skills Dialogue to address the skills challenges both sides face. Mr Turnbull also announced at a CEO Forum a A$30 million (S$30.5 million) investment fund to support smart cities. The initiative will set up a knowledge bank of sustainable urban planning ideas to be shared between Asean and Australia. Separately, Mr Lee attended a reception for overseas Singaporeans yesterday with his wife Ho Ching and Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan. Mr Lee said the bilateral relationship is a very ""intense engagement and connection"", with exchanges on many levels. Some 300 Singaporeans living in Sydney packed the Shangri-La Hotel's Grand Ballroom to meet them. "
Asean and Australia sign deal to combat terrorism together,"SYDNEY - Asean and Australia signed an agreement to cooperate on fighting violent extremism and terrorism financing on Saturday (March 17), as Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull warned that terrorists are using digital technology in innovative ways to finance, plan and conduct their attacks.

"US tags Maute IS ally, blocks terror funding"," THE United States added the Maute group as an affiliate of the Islamic State in its list of foreign terrorist organizations, a move that Malacañang welcomed Wednesday. Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque said the US action reaffirmed the government’s long-held belief that the Maute group, which overran Marawi City last year, was composed of local terrorists aided by foreign extremists. The US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control on Tuesday included Maute group along with Abu Musab Al-Barnawi of Nigeria and Mahad Moalim of Somalia, and seven groups from Bangladesh, Egypt, Somalia, Nigeria and Tunisia to its sanction list. “This likewise recognizes the decisive action we have taken in liberating Marawi from these terrorists, which resulted in the success of the government in thwarting the establishment of an Islamic caliphate in the area and the containing of the rebellion from spreading to other parts of the Philippines,” Roque added. It took five months for the military and police to retake Marawi City, in fighting that left more than 1,100 people dead and that sparked fears that ISIS would gain a foothold in Southeast Asia. “Terrorism, indeed, knows no borders and the inclusion of the Maute group in the list of specially designated global terrorists and foreign terrorist organizations as an affiliate group of ISIS shows the solidarity and resolve of the international community to flush out evil forces to make the world safe and secure,” the statement added.A Defense department official said the inclusion of the Maute group in the list of global terrorist groups would also fortify efforts to track and freeze foreign funding from international organizations. This, said Defense spokesman Arsenio Andolong, would stop foreign groups from providing logistical support for local terrorists. “Such declaration from foreign countries will of course invariably help us in many ways in our fight against local terrorist and their foreign cohorts,” Andolong said. Armed Forces spokesman Brig. Gen. Bienvenido Datuin Jr. said the inclusion of the Maute group would make it easier to check money trails, financial sources, logistics lines and conduits of terror groups in foreign countries that may have connections with local violent extremists, he added. The US declaration comes in the wake of reports that 40 foreign fighters had slipped into Mindanao. Foreign financial aid to the Lanao-based Maute terror group will become more constricted with the United States’ official tagging of the group as a terrorist organization, officials said Wednesday."
"‘Resist all temptation; don’t let me down,’ Dela Rosa tells SAF troopers"," Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa on Wednesday urged the the newest batch of the elite Special Action Force (SAF) troopers assigned at the New Bilibid Prison (NBP) in Muntinlupa City to “resist all forms of temptation” and stop the proliferation of illegal drugs there. “You are the SAF. You are the best of the best, the cream of the crop. Don’t let me down because you are my last hope to stop the proliferation of illegal drug trade inside the Bilibid,” he said. “If you fail, I don’t have anybody else to turn to. That’s why you have to resist the temptations, the bribes because you are not facing ordinary criminals. They are geniuses with evil minds,” he added. The new battalion, headed by Chief Superintendent Christopher Mendoza who is a Marawi siege veteran, will replace at least 300 SAF commandos guarding the NBP’s maximum security compound and Building 14 where criminals who have committed the most heinous crimes are detained. Dela Rosa also belied the allegations that the outgoing SAF troops were involved in any illegal activities with the inmates. He expressed confidence that the new battalion will be just as successful in their mission since most of them are Marawi survivors. “You have seen the worst. Everyday you had to face death doon sa Marawi and I’m very proud na napagtagumpayan niyo ‘yun. Tinalo niyo yung ISIS sa Marawi ito pa kaya?” Dela Rosa stated. However, Dela Rosa noted the “new players” who have entered the illegal drug trade inside the medium security compound. The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) said that newly-convicted Chinese drug lords have become the new players of the illegal drug trade inside the NBP. He said he will be willing to deploy additional more forces if the need arises. The maximum security compound currently houses 18,000 high-profile inmates while the medium security compound has 6,000 detainees. The Building 14 has about 100 inmates. The new batch of SAF troops will be the fourth to guard the NBP. It was on July 20, 2016 when the first batch of SAF troopers were deployed to the NBP to stop the proliferation of illegal drugs there."
Death toll rises to 18 in Crimea college blast,"""It's a colossal tragedy, 18 people died, and 40 more injured, for the time being,"" Aksyonov told Rossiya 24 channel, after authorities earlier said 50 people were injured. A student carried out the attack and shot himself, according to the leader of the Russian-annexed peninsula Sergei Askyonov. Most of those killed or wounded are teenagers. Russia's Investigative Committee, which probes major incidents, said it had ""opened a criminal case into a terrorist attack"" after an ""unidentified explosive device"" went off in the polytechnical college in Kerch city. Investigators said the explosive device went off in the college's canteen and that it was ""packed with metal objects."" ""Currently we know of 13 dead and around 50 injured,"" Investigative Committee spokeswoman Svetlana Petrenko earlier said in televised comments. The ""most of the (victims) are teenagers,"" the committee said. The college's website says it accepts students in the last three grades of school, from the age of 14. An unnamed witness who worked nearby said in a video on Kerch.tv website victims ""were taken away in public transport, in minibuses and buses, with 2 or 3 people in each ambulance."" ""They are children and staff,"" the witness said. ""I saw people without legs, without arms."" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Vladimir Putin had been informed of the ""tragic news"" from Kerch and that he ""expresses deep condolences to those who lost relatives and loved ones."" Crimean leader Sergei Aksyonov said on Facebook he had gone to the scene and ""all the necessary services are working at the scene of the incident."" The emergency services ministry said that it had flown out three helicopters and a plane with rescuers. Kerch is linked to the Russian mainland by a bridge opened by Putin in May this year."
Nearly 100 killed in ambulance blast in Afghan capital Kabul," KABUL, Jan 28 — A bomb hidden in an ambulance killed at least 95 people and wounded about 158 in the Afghan capital Kabul yesterday when it blew up at a police checkpoint in a busy part of the city that was crowded with pedestrians. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the suicide blast, a week after they claimed an attack on the Intercontinental Hotel in which more than 20 people were killed. An interior ministry spokesman blamed the Haqqani network, a militant group affiliated with the Taliban which Afghan and Western officials consider to be behind many of the biggest attacks on urban targets in Afghanistan. As medical teams struggled to handle the casualties pouring in, some of the wounded were laid out in the open, with intravenous drips set up next to them in hospital gardens. “It's a massacre,” said Dejan Panic, coordinator in Afghanistan for the Italian aid group Emergency, which runs a nearby trauma hospital that treated dozens of wounded. Hours after the blast, a health ministry spokesman said the casualty toll had risen to at least 95 killed and 158 wounded. Yesterday's explosion capped a violent week in Afghanistan, with the siege at the Intercontinental Hotel and another attack on an office of the aid group Save the Children in the eastern city of Jalalabad. That attack was claimed by Islamic State. The wave of attacks has put pressure on President Ashraf Ghani and his US allies, who have expressed growing confidence that a new more aggressive military strategy has succeeded in driving Taliban insurgents back from major provincial centres. The United States has stepped up its assistance to Afghan security forces and increased its air strikes against the Taliban and other militant groups, aiming to break a stalemate and force the insurgents to the negotiating table. However, the Taliban have dismissed suggestions they have been weakened by the new strategy, and the past week has shown their capacity to mount deadly, high-profile attacks is undiminished, even in the heavily protected centre of Kabul. Washington, which has accused Pakistan of giving assistance to the Taliban and has cut off some aid to Islamabad, urged all countries to take ""decisive action"" to stop the violence. “There can be no tolerance for those who support or offer sanctuary to terrorist groups,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement. Pakistan, which denies the accusations, condemned the attack and called for ""concerted efforts and effective cooperation among the states to eradicate the scourge of terrorism."" Yesterday is a working day in Afghanistan and the streets were full when the blast went off at around lunchtime in a busy part of the city close to shops and markets and near a number of foreign embassies and government buildings. Mirwais Yasini, a member of parliament who was near the blast, said an ambulance approached the checkpoint and blew up, having passed through another checkpoint further down the road. The target was apparently an Interior Ministry building but the victims were mainly people who happened to be in the street. Buildings hundreds of metres (yards) away were shaken by the force of the blast, which left torn bodies strewn on the street amid piles of rubble, debris and wrecked cars. “Today's attack is nothing short of an atrocity,” Tadamichi Yamamoto, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, said in a statement, adding that those behind it must be brought to justice. The casualty toll is the worst since 150 people were killed in a huge truck bomb explosion last May near the German embassy. That attack prompted a major reinforcement of security aimed at preventing similar vehicle-borne assaults. Security officials said further attacks were likely and security was tightened around potential targets in the city. But with much of central Kabul already a heavily fortified zone of high concrete blast walls and police checkpoints, there were angry questions about how the bomber got through. “Officials must be held responsible,” said former deputy Interior Minister Mohammad Ayub Salangi. People helped walking-wounded away as ambulances with sirens wailed through the traffic-clogged streets of the city centre. “I was sitting in the office when the explosion went off,” said Alam, an office worker whose head was badly cut in the blast. “All the windows shattered, the building collapsed and everything came down.” The Swedish and Dutch embassies as well as the European Union mission and an Indian consular office are also nearby but there were no reports that any staff were hurt."
Cafe blast kills pro-Moscow rebel leader in east Ukraine," MOSCOW/KIEV (REUTERS) - The leader of Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine was killed on Friday (Aug 31) in a blast at a cafe in Donetsk city, the separatist administration said. Russia's foreign ministry accused Ukraine of assassinating the separatist leader, Alexander Zakharchenko, to try to unleash a renewed war in eastern Ukraine, but Kiev said it had nothing to do with the blast and blamed separatist infighting. Russian President Vladimir Putin called the killing a""dastardly"" crime aimed at destabilising a fragile regional peace, but he did not accuse Kiev of being behind it. Zakharchenko, who led the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic since 2014, ""received injuries incompatible with life as a result of an explosion in the centre of Donetsk,"" the separatist administration said in a statement. Russian-backed rebels threw off Ukrainian central rule in an armed uprising after pro-Western leaders opposed by Moscow came to power in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, in 2014. A shaky internationally-brokered ceasefire has been in force since 2015, halting large-scale fighting, though there are still frequent outbreaks of shooting on the front line between the separatist and Ukrainian forces. In a telegram of condolences released by the Kremlin, Putin praised Zakharchenko as a true popular leader and a patriot. ""The dastardly killing of Alexander Zakharchenko is further evidence: those who have chosen the path of terror, violence and spreading fear do not want to seek a peaceful political solution to the conflict,"" the telegram said. ""They are placing a dangerous bet on destabilising the situation,"" Putin said, without specifying who those people were. Russia's Foreign Ministry had every reason to believe Kiev was responsible for Zakharchenko's death, ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on the Rossiya-24 state television station. Russia's Investigative Committee, the state body that handles major crimes, said it was treating the killing as an act of international terrorism. In Kiev, a spokeswoman for the state Security Service, Yelena Gitlyanskaya, dismissed Moscow's accusations, saying the killing was a result of years-long ""internal fighting... between the terrorists and their Russian sponsors"". Zakharchenko, a 42-year-old former coalmine electrician, became leader of the Donetsk Republic in November 2014. Other rebel leaders say he was handpicked for the role by Moscow. A vote held by separatists confirmed him in office. The separatists have been dogged by infighting that has, on occasion, turned violent. Several past leaders of the separatists have fled the region, saying they feared for their lives after their comrades turned on them. Earlier this year, three sources who led the original uprising in 2014 told Reuters they expected Zakharchenko to be pushed aside, with Moscow's assistance, and that a new rebel leadership would take over. In the past, at least five other leading separatist commanders have been killed in unexplained circumstances not connected to front-line combat. Separatist officials blamed Ukraine for those deaths, while Kiev - and some separatists speaking on condition of anonymity - said in some cases the commanders were killed in internal purges. Among those killed was Arseny Pavlov, who went by the nom de guerre ""Motorola"" and was blown up in the lift of his apartment building in Donetsk in October 2016. Another prominent casualty was Alexander Bednov, nicknamed""Batman,"" a senior commander in the Luhansk People's Republic, another eastern Ukrainian breakaway region that neighbours Donetsk. He was killed in January 2015 when his convoy came under fire in a location where, at the time, there was no fighting with Ukrainian forces. A source close to the Donetsk separatist leadership, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters on Friday that Denis Pushilin, head of the rebel legislature, was likely to become caretaker leader of the region. The separatist administration, in its statement, said the blast that killed Zakharchenko also injured the deputy prime minister of the self-proclaimed republic, Alexander Timofeyev."
Terrorist attack' kills six Tunisia security forces," TUNIS, July 9 — Six members of Tunisia's security forces were killed yesterday in a “terrorist attack” near the border with Algeria, the interior ministry said, the country's deadliest such incident in over two years. The attack comes as Tunisia is hoping for its best tourist season since a spate of jihadist attacks in 2015 sent visitor numbers plunging. A national guard border patrol in the Ain Sultan area of the Jenduba border province “was hit in a landmine ambush that killed six agents” at 11.45am (1045 GMT), the ministry said in a statement. Ministry spokesman General Sufyan al-Zaq said the blast was a “terrorist attack” and that assailants had “opened fire on security forces” after the mine exploded. “Combing operations” were underway, said Zaq, who had earlier told AFP that eight guards were killed in the attack. No group has claimed the attack, which took place in a mountainous border area where the Al-Qaeda-linked Okba Ibn Nafaa Battalion and the Tunisian branch of the Islamic State group, Jund al-Khilafa (Soldiers of the Caliphate), are active. “We are aware that the war on terrorism will be long,” interim Interior Minister Ghazi Jeribi said on state TV, adding that three security forces were also wounded in the attack. “We will go into their (the terrorists) dens and we will avenge the Tunisian people,” said Jeribi, who was ordered to go to Jenduba. The attack is likely to exacerbate an ongoing political crisis in Tunisia, where Prime Minister Youssef Chahed, who recently fired the previous interior minister, is facing heat from his own allies. There are regular attacks along the Algerian border, but this was the first time in two years security forces suffered such a loss. Yesterday's assault marks the bloodiest attack in Tunisia since a March 2016 attack on security installations in the town of Ben Guerdane on the Libyan border. That attack killed 13 security forces and seven civilians. Tunisia's tourism industry is still rebounding from a string of devastating attacks in 2015, including one at the National Bardo museum in Tunis and another targeting a beach resort in Sousse that together killed 59 foreign tourists and a Tunisian guard. In May, Tourism Minister Selma Elloumi Rekik said the industry had made a “real recovery.” ""People are coming back to Tunisia because there is security ... we are at the same level (of security) as any European city,"" she said. Since the 2011 uprising that toppled dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, jihadist attacks in Tunisia have killed dozens of members of the security forces and foreign tourists. Since Ben Ali's fall, “at least 127 militants and 118 soldiers, national guardsmen, and police officers have been killed in the northwest,” according to figures compiled by analyst Matt Herbert and published in June by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “This new attack shows that there are still pockets where security problems have not been solved,” he told AFP on Sunday, while stressing “the vast majority of Tunisia remains safe.” The country has been under a state of emergency since November 2015, when an IS-claimed suicide bombing in Tunis killed 12 presidential guards."
Blast at Indian restaurant in Canada injures 15: Police,"Canadian police on Friday hunted two men after a blast at an Indian restaurant near Toronto injured 15 people, but police said there were no initial signs of terrorism. An improvised device detonated Thursday night at the eatery in Mississauga, a major suburb west of Toronto, while two parties celebrated birthdays, Peel Regional Police Chief Jennifer Evans told a news conference. ""Two men wearing hoodies were seen entering the restaurant with an IED,"" or improvised device, she said. ""The men were seen fleeing the scene immediately following the explosion."" The men did not say anything, just dropped off the device and left, authorities said earlier. ""Every police resource is being used right now to locate the people responsible for this horrendous act,"" Evans added, giving the number of injured as 15. Three of them -- a 35-year-old man and two women, aged 48 and 62 -- were taken by ambulance to hospital in critical condition, and were listed as stable on Friday morning. Other victims were treated for minor injuries after the blast at the Bombay Bhel restaurant. ""This is a heinous crime,"" Mississauga Mayor Bonnie Crombie said. So far there is ""no indication this is a terrorist act, no indication this is a hate crime,"" said police chief Evans, who added: ""We haven't ruled anything out as we start our investigation."" The Toronto metropolitan area has a sizeable population with Indian origins."
Suicide blast targeting police kills seven in Pakistan’s Lahore,"LAHORE, March 15 — A suicide bomb blast claimed by the Taliban ripped through a police checkpoint on the outskirts of the Pakistani city of Lahore yesterday, killing seven people and wounding 18, officials said. Jam Sajjad Hussain, spokesman of a state-run rescue service, told Reuters that his officials had taken seven dead bodies to hospitals. “Our rescuers are at work,” he said. “They have shifted so far seven bodies.” Deputy Inspector General of police Haider Ashraf said the bomb exploded when the police were changing guards at the checkpoint just outside an annual religious congregation in Raiwind, where nearly 80,000 people were in attendance. “A suicide bomber riding a motorcycle attacked the police,” Ashraf said. He said four of the dead were police. A Pakistani Taliban spokesman Mohammad Khurasani claimed responsibility for the suicide attack in a WhatsApp message sent to a Reuters reporter. Lahore is considered a cultural hub of the nuclear-armed nation of over 208 million people where Islamist militants have been fighting for over a decade against the state in a bid to install their own harsh brand of Islamic governance. Located in the east of the country, Lahore has largely been spared the militant violence seen in the country’s northwest which sits at the edge of a lawless mountain range along the Afghan border. That area has long been home to local and foreign Islamist militants from the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, and where Islamic State has lately made footholds. The Pakistani Taliban leadership have fled to neighbouring Afghanistan from where Islamabad alleges they plan and execute terrorist attacks inside Pakistan. Washington today offered a US$5 million (RM19.5 million) bounty for the Pakistani Taliban militant leader, Mulllah Fazlullah, a day after a suspected US drone strike on a training camp in a remote part of Afghanistan killed his son and more than 20 other militants preparing to launch suicide attacks in Pakistan. The US cooperation comes amid worsening US-Pakistan relations, and coincided with a visit to Washington by Pakistan’s foreign secretary for talks expected to focus on boosting counter-terrorism cooperation and the US strategy in Afghanistan.

"One dead, one hurt in blast outside Stockholm area metro","STOCKHOLM, Jan 8 — One person died and another was slightly hurt yesterday in a blast outside a metro station in a Stockholm suburb, which police said did not appear to be a terrorist attack. A man in his 60s died in hospital after “he picked up an object off the ground which promptly exploded,” police spokesman Sven-Erik Olsson told AFP. A woman aged 45 was also hurt, suffering facial injuries, police said. The blast occurred mid-morning at the Varby gard station in Huddinge, a southern suburb of the Swedish capital. Police cordoned off the station and the square where the blast happened as the bomb squad moved in to investigate. The Expressen and Aftonbladet newspapers said the device was a hand grenade. “It is too early to say. Technicians are still working on it. Nothing indicates that the (injured) couple were targeted,” said Olsson, adding there was nothing to suggest an act of terrorism. Local resident Milorad Jencic told AFP he was shocked as witnesses and onlookers gathered around the police cordon. “We had incidents in the 1990s and early 2000s. There were very violent gangs” at the time, he said, adding he was “surprised” by this blast because he thought those groups had since disappeared. According to a Swedish police report published last year, Sweden is the European country where criminal gangs use the most grenades, often from stocks from the former Yugoslavia. In August 2016, an eight-year-old boy was killed by a grenade thrown into a flat in a working-class area of Gothenburg."

The country has been under a state of emergency since November 2015, when an IS-claimed suicide bombing in Tunis killed 12 presidential guards."
" Deadly blast hits eastern Afghan city, targeting Sikh minority","JALALABAD, AFGHANISTAN (REUTERS) - An explosion hit the centre of the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad on Sunday (July 1), killing at least 20 people, including several members of the small Sikh minority, provincial government officials said. The blast, hours after President Ashraf Ghani had opened a hospital in Jalalabad, damaged shops and buildings around Mukhaberat square in the city, governor's spokesman Attaullah Khogyani said. A politician representing the minority Sikh community was killed in the blast. Officials said Awtar Singh Khalsa, who had planned to stand in October's parliamentary elections, was dead. Ghulam Sanayi Stanekzai, police chief of Nangarhar, said the explosion was caused by a suicide bomber who targeted a vehicle carrying members of the Sikh minority who were travelling to meet the president. Islamic State claimed the attack in a statement via its online Amaq news agency, but provided no evidence for the claim. Officials said at least 10 of the dead were Sikhs. Afghanistan is an overwhelmingly Muslim nation but a small number of Hindus and Sikhs remain in the country. One seat in the Afghan parliament is reserved for a member of the country's small Sikh and Hindu communities. But increasing numbers of Sikhs and Hindus have moved to India, their spiritual homeland, due to persecution and repeated threats. Officials at the Indian Embassy in Kabul confirmed the death of ten Sikhs and condemned ""the terrorist attack"" in Jalalabad. ""The attack underlines the need for a united global fight against international terrorism without discrimination and accountability of those who support terrorists in any manner,""the Indian Embassy said on Twitter. Inaamullah Miakhel, a spokesman for the provincial health department of Nangarhar, said 20 people were wounded. Officials said the casualty total might have been even higher had much of the city not been blocked off for Ghani's visit. He was not in the area when the blast occurred. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast, the latest in a series to have hit Jalalabad, the provincial capital of Nangarhar, where Islamic State fighters have established a strong presence in recent years. The attack underlined the fragile security situation in Afghanistan after last month's brief ceasefire between government forces and the Taliban. The three-day truce did not include Islamic State, which fights both government forces and the Taliban and which has shown no sign of letting up its campaign of violence."
 Police search for motive after 49 hurt in Zimbabwe election blast," HARARE (REUTERS) - Police said on Sunday (June 24) they were searching for a motive for an explosion at Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa's election rally that injured 49 people. Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, the general who led a de facto coup that forced long-time leader Robert Mugabe to resign in November, described Saturday's (June 23) blast as a ""terrorist act"" that would not stop the July 30 presidential, parliamentary and local elections, Zimbabwe's first post-Mugabe vote. ""The police will hunt down the criminals. They will be hunted down and they will be brought before the law,"" Chiwenga told a campaign rally of the ruling ZANU-PF party in the town of Chitungwiza, 30 km (20 miles) south of the capital Harare. Mugabe has said he felt betrayed by Mnangagwa, his former protege, and has called his presidency illegal. Mnangagwa, 75, and Nelson Chamisa, 40, the leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, are the main contenders in next month's vote. Chiwenga's wife was among those injured and police said the toll could rise as more people came forward. National police spokeswoman Charity Charamba said police were pursuing leads after the blast at a stadium in Bulawayo, the opposition heartland where ZANU-PF has lost all national elections since 2000. Mnangagwa escaped injury. Charamba told reporters a ""substantial reward"" was being offered for information. She did not give details. It was not clear who was responsible for the explosion, which Mnangagwa called a cowardly act, or how the security around the president was breached. Mnangagwa adopted most of Mugabe's security and bureaucratic system, fearing a complete overhaul, which the military had sought, could cause government instability and cost him votes. As internal security minister at independence in 1980, Mnangagwa built the system that protected Mugabe, but as tensions rose over who would succeed the 94-year-old, it broke into factions. Without mentioning names, Mnangagwa said there were some people who did not accept his presidency and his ""usual enemies""were behind the blast. Two sources close to Mnangagwa said some Mugabe loyalists in the security and government establishment were ""hurting"" over the November coup. ""You cannot say this is a terrorist act and neither can you say it was done by state actors who want to take power. These are people who are hurting, who want to harm the president and they have access,"" one of the sources told Reuters, declining to be named. South African President Cyril Rampahosa condemned the attack and said the regional Southern African Development Community would ""evaluate the incident and appropriate steps."" Among Zimbabwe's small but vibrant Twitter and Facebook communities, people posted theories, including accusations this was an inside job meant to gain sympathy votes in an opposition stronghold. Hasnain Malik, global head of equity research at Exotix Capital said Saturday's incident could have been a result of tensions within Mnangagwa's government. ""There are two long-standing tensions in Zimbabwe: First, within ZANU-PF, between Mnangagwa's Lacoste faction and Mugabe's G40 factions, with an undertone of tribal tension,"" Malik said in a note to investors."
Israeli army: Palestinian killed in Gaza border fence blast,"GAZA CITY, July 19 — A Palestinian was killed yesterday when a part of Israel’s fortifications on the Gaza border blew up as he tampered with it, the Israeli military said. The 24-year-old man’s death in northern Gaza followed a more than two-month surge in tensions along the frontier, where Israeli troops have killed at least 125 Palestinians during sometimes violent mass demonstrations. Residents said the man killed in the blast was among a group of Palestinians who approached the border fence, drawing fire from soldiers on the other side. An Israeli military statement described them as “five terrorists who tried to sabotage the (border) security infrastructure”. “The security infrastructure exploded, and as a result of that, there were casualties among the terrorists,” it said. Military spokesmen declined to elaborate on the blast or say whether Israel had employed a new counter-measure against incursions. Since its last war with Gaza’s dominant Hamas Islamists in 2014, Israel has stepped up efforts to prevent cross-border attacks, improving rocket interceptors and investing in technologies for detecting and destroying guerrilla tunnels. Faced with international censure over its use of live fire in the fence protests, Israel says troops have been holding off border breaches and responding to gunmen who tried to use civilians as cover for attacks on them. There have been no serious Israeli casualties in the confrontations since the so-called “Great March of Return” was launched on March 30 to press for what Palestinians see as their right to lands lost to Israel during the 1948 war of its founding. But incendiary materials flown in from Gaza by kites or helium balloons have destroyed swathes of farmland and forests, and killed wildlife. In what the military described as a response to the blazes, Israeli jets struck nine Hamas targets in northern Gaza yesterday. Sirens sounded in outlying Israeli areas and the military said three rockets had been launched towards Israeli territory but one fell short in Gaza. “These are terrorist acts that endanger Israeli residents living in southern Israel and damage extensive areas in Israeli territory,” a military statement said of the kites and balloons. There were no casualties in the air strikes or rocket launches. Israel has drafted in civilian drone enthusiasts as army reservists, instructing them to fly their remote-controlled aircraft into the kites, an Israeli general said, but an effective means to stop the kites has yet to be found. Around two million people live in Gaza, most of them the descendants of refugees from what is now Israel. The territory has been controlled by Hamas for more than a decade, during which it has fought three wars against Israel. Israel and Egypt maintain a blockade of the strip, citing security reasons, which has caused an economic crisis and collapse in living standards there over the past decade"
"Alleged Tangerang terrorist always neat and well behaved, say neighbors","Muhammad Choir, 32, the man the National Police’s Densus 88 counterterrorism squad arrested on Wednesday for his alleged involvement in a terror group, always looked neat and relaxed in public, a neighbor has said. The neighbor, who identified herself only as Vera, said that Muhammad often took a morning walk around their neighborhood on Jl. Gempol Raya, Tangerang, wearing a T-shirt and shorts. It was only on Friday that Muhammad, who had a thin beard, wore a loose tunic or gamis. According to the tempo.co report, Vera said she knew Muhammad as a tailor who made school uniforms, sports attire and Islamic dress. “He received a lot of orders, especially for early childhood school [PAUD] uniforms. His customers were mostly women,” Vera said on Wednesday as quoted by tempo.co. Another neighbor, Midah, 43, said Muhammad was a nice neighbor that he called “Om Choir”, or ""Uncle Choir"". “When he went back to his hometown in Medan, he bought me coffee as a gift. When he went to Sukabumi, Om Choir brought me mochi,” she said. Sukabumi is the hometown of Choir’s wife, whom he married three months ago. Choir lived in a rental house for about a year, paying annual rent of about Rp 10 million (US$710.64). Choir only had one employee, identified only as G, who was nicknamed Ujang and also arrested on Wednesday. “I don’t know their real names. I called them Om Choir, Ujang and Teteh (a common Sundanese title meaning ""elder sister"") for [Choir’s] wife,” said Midah. On Wednesday, Densus 88 personnel raided several locations on Jl. Gempol in Pinang and on Jl. Kunciran Indah, which is located about 1 kilometer from Jl. Gempol. They arrested Muhammad, G and another man identified as A who were allegedly involved in a terrorist group. Muhammad’s wife was also detained as a witness. National Police spokesperson Insp. Gen. Setyo Waseso said they suspected the group was part of the Jakarta branch of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), a local group that has pledged allegiance to Islamic State (IS)."
" Blast destroys shop and home in Leicester, five taken to hospital","LONDON, Feb 26 — An explosion destroyed a convenience store and a home in the central English city of Leicester yesterday, injuring at least five people, officials said. British police said there was no immediate indication that the explosion was linked to terrorism. Pictures and videos posted on Twitter showed flames leaping into the sky from the site which was reduced to rubble. “All emergency services are currently dealing with this,” the police force said in a statement. Later it said the blast was being investigated with the fire service. “At this stage there is no indication this is terrorist related,” Leicestershire police said. A local hospital said four patients were in a critical condition and fifth person had also been brought in for treatment by police. A photograph published by the Leicester Mercury newspaper showed a blaze and the rubble of a destroyed building which the newspaper said housed a convenience store and a flat above it. “We heard an absolutely massive explosion. It was pretty frightening,” the Mercury quoted an unidentified resident, who lives a few streets away, as saying. “We went to look out of the upstairs windows and saw loads of smoke, and then a few seconds later massive orange flames.” The city’s fire department said it sent six fire engines after the reports of a large explosion and a building collapse. The Leicester Mercury said debris had been blown across the road in front of the site. Police said a number of other buildings were damaged and homes and businesses in the area had been evacuated."
Ayob Khan: Police repatriated 30 terrorist suspects since 2014," PUTRAJAYA, Jan 5 — The Royal Malaysia Police (RMP) repatriated about 30 of the 50 suspected terrorists sent to Malaysia since 2014, said Bukit Aman Special Branch Counter Terrorism Division Principal Assistant Director Datuk Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay. He said the suspects were sent to this country following their detention in various countries which he declined to name. According to international law, suspected terrorists detained in any country should be repatriated to their last port of embarkation, instead of the country that they wanted to go to, he added. “If the suspect was detained in Dubai, for instance, then the suspect must be repatriated to Dubai and not Malaysia. If you ask him where he wants to go, of course he will say Malaysia because we are open, and they don’t need visa to come here,” he told reporters after delivering his talk at the Putrajaya International Security Dialogue (PISD) 2018 here today. Ayob Khan said most of those repatriated were Daesh terrorist suspects of various nationalities, the majority of whom were Arabs. He also said some countries should share early information with Malaysia on the movements of terrorist suspects to facilitate the Malaysian police to take action against them, including monitoring, detaining and sending them to their countries of origin. “We need intelligence sharing, if not, how can we detect any terrorist suspect?,” he asked. He said the Malaysian Government and the RMP were constantly working to enhance cooperation with other countries to address problems related to the repatriation of terrorist suspects. Previously, Reuters reported that Turkish authorities deported militant suspects to Kuala Lumpur without any prior notice after they were arrested while trying to enter Syria to join the Daesh group of militants. Ayob Khan said 105 Daesh terrorist suspects had been detained last year, slightly lower than 119 arrested in 2016. Commenting on the two-day PISD themed ‘Wisdom and Moderation in Combating Terrorism’, he said the dialogue was organised by the Home Ministry in collaboration with Rabitah Al-Alami Al-Islami (the Muslim World League), a non-governmental organisation based in Saudi Arabia."
AFP intensifies conduct of checkpoints in Isulan another blast rocked Sultan Kudarat,"The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) on Tuesday said that it has intensified the conduct of checkpoints in Isulan, Sultan Kudarat following another blast that rocked the town Sunday night. In a statement, AFP Spokesman Col. Edgard Arevalo, said military units on the ground have further intensified the conduct of checkpoints in all of the town’s entry and exit points to prevent terrorists from again placing IEDs (improvise explosive device). “We have stepped up further patrols and intelligence efforts,” Arevalo said. “We have (also) alerted our troops to augment PNP (Philippine National Police) efforts in the now ensuing police manhunt operations,” he added. Arevalo said the AFP condemns in the strongest terms possible the cowardly attack that targeted innocent civilians. He said the perpetrators’ means of assaulting hapless victims through terror, death and destruction do not justify their ideals. With this in mind, Arevalo assured that government security forces will address these vile aggressions with vehement counteractions and with the support of the community, they will get those criminals. “(Also) with the help of the local residents, we can potentially prevent any repeat (of the incident),” he said. Arevalo said the local government of Isulan led by Mayor Marites Palasigue and the PNP are leading the efforts to hunt down the perpetrators behind the incident. He added that the AFP extend its sincerest condolences to the victims of the bombing and assure their families that the AFP is one with them in their quest for justice. Two persons perished while 14 others were wounded — three of them critically — as a result of the explosion. “We continue to call on the public to help suppress this twin terrorist attacks since the targets are civilians. While government security forces were not stopping to arrest the criminals, justice will be more swiftly served to the victims if the people will be with us in this fight by discreetly reporting the whereabouts of these terrorists,” Arevalo said. Arevalo said the AFP is urging communities to unite in these attacks by terrorists targeting the lives of people, their freedom of movement, and the peace in the towns and cities. “We urge every individual—every man or woman, young or old— to be vigilant and actively involved in reporting their observation of any suspicious activities or persons in their localities,” Arevalo said. “Only with that unity of our communities; only with that degree of vigilance and participation of our people combined with the diligent and dedicated government security forces can we as a nation triumph over these terrorists,” he said. The Army’s 6th Infantry Division (6th ID) said they are looking at the possibility that the Daesh-inspired group under Esmael Abdulmalik alias Abu Toraife/Toraype, was behind the blast. In an interview, AFP 6th ID spokesman Capt. Arvin Encinas said Sunday night’s bombing in Isulan town, Sultan Kudarat was perpetrated by the faction under Abdulmalik, an influential cleric and skilled bomb expert, said to be involved in previous bombings in Maguindanao. He said their main purpose is to sow terror and create fear in the community. The group’s areas of operations are in Maguindanao and Sultan Kudarat. “Itong pagpapasabog eh part ng retaliation nila as they suffered significant losses during our FMO (focus military operations),” Encinas said With regard to criticism by some that another bombing incident happened in Sultan Kudarat despite the implementation of martial law in Mindanao, Encinas said terrorism is a global issue that even the most advance countries are having a hard time dealing with. “Terrorism is a global issue, even the most advanced and developed countries ay nagkakaroon ng (also experience the) same incident,” Encinas said. “Security is not only the sole responsibility of the security forces, that is why we are asking support and vigilance of each and every one of us,” he added. Encinas, said the explosion caused by an IED (improvised explosive device), took place in an internet cafe adjacent to Novo Department Store in Kalawag 2, Isulan, Sultan Kudarat,.at about 7:30 p.m. Sunday. Army 6th Infantry Division chief Brig. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, said the explosion that hit Kalawag 2, is about 400 to 500 meters away where another IED exploded almost a week ago which claimed the lives of three people and wounded 34 others."
"Abu Sayyaf terrorist killed, 22 soldiers wounded in Sulu encounter","An Abu Sayyaf terrorist was killed while 22 soldiers were wounded following an encounter that took place in Patikul, Sulu on Thursday. A report coming from the Armed Forces of the Philippines-Western Mindanao Command (AFP-WestMinCom), identified the killed ASG terrorist as Alpata Abdurasa. On the other hand, 17 of the 22 soldiers wounded or battle casualties (batcas) sustained slight shrapnel wounds caused by M203 grenade launcher. three sustained gunshot wounds while the two others due to a 90RR back blast. The wounded troops were taken to Camp Teodulfo Bautista Station Hospital for medical attention. It was learned that operating troops of the Army’s 41st Infantry Battalion were on a combat operation when it encountered more or less 40 Abu Sayyaf Group members under ASG Sub-leader Idang Susukan and Ben Tattoo in Barangay Langhub, Patikul, Sulu at about 9:30 a.m. Thursday. The firefight lasted for 45 minutes afterwhich the enemy scampered to different directions bringing along with them their casualties. It was reported that there could be more casualties on the enemy side due to the blood stains speckled in the area but this has yet to be determined. “I commend the troops of the Joint Task Force Sulu for their untiring dedication to their duties. Rest assured all battle casualties will be given prompt and due medical treatment,” said WestMinCom Chief Lieutenant General Arnel B. Dela Vega. “We will continuously intensify our operations to expedite the neutralization of the Abu Sayyaf Group until the peace that the people of Sulu deserve is attained,” he added. As of press time, troops are still scouring the encounter site while other units are in pursuit against the local terrorist."
Rights groups condemn Kabul school blast as outrage grows,"Rights groups Thursday condemned a suicide blast inside a school that killed dozens of students in Kabul a day earlier, as outrage over the attack grew while tearful families buried loved ones in the war-weary Afghan capital. The Islamic State-claimed blast hit an education centre in a Shiite area of western Kabul where students were studying for college entrance exams. The attack was just one of the most shocking in a blood-soaked week across Afghanistan that has left security forces and civilians reeling. Two gunmen attacked an intelligence training centre in Kabul Thursday, firing on security forces for several hours before they were killed, police spokesman Hashmat Stanikzai said, adding that there were no other casualties. Thursday’s attack was also claimed by the Islamic State via their Amaq propaganda service. In addition to the IS attacks, Taliban militants also delivered high-profile, demoralising blows in the strategic city of Ghazni — which they attacked last week, forcing security forces backed by US air power to struggle for days to push them out — and in Faryab, where they captured a northern base, killing at least 17 soldiers. Security forces in Afghanistan, beset by desertions and killings, have suffered staggering losses since US-led NATO ended its combat mission in the country in 2014. The week’s violence has raised questions about their ability to hold off the resurgent Taliban. But civilians have long taken the brunt of the violence in Afghanistan — especially in Kabul, a target of both the Taliban and IS — and Wednesday’s attack on the school was branded a “war crime” by Amnesty International. The majority of the victims were children, most aged between 16 and 18, authorities said, and were studying for their university entrance exams. Amnesty warned it proved “beyond any doubt that Afghanistan and, in particular, its capital Kabul, are not safe”, and said European countries must stop returning Afghan refugees to the war-torn country. UNICEF, meanwhile, branded the attack “deplorable” and called for parties on all sides of the conflict to protect children. Outrage was also growing on social media, where Afghans condemned the attack and angrily denounced those behind it — as well as the government for failing to protect them. Facebook user Ramazan Ali Ramazan described the victims as an “asset” to the country. “Death and hatred to this government and filthy terrorist that everyday they are killing innocent Afghans,” he added. Families of the dead held a mass funeral Thursday where mourners wept and clutched the wooden coffins. An industrial-sized digger helped soften the arid ground for the fresh graves as men removed rocks from the soil with pickaxes. Mourners decried the unrelenting bloodshed, while others dismissed murmurings of possible ceasefires and peace negotiations between the government and the Taliban, even though the attack was claimed by IS. “Death to your ceasefire and death to your ghost peace talks,” cried one of the funeral attendees. “They are killing our educated people and every day they are killing us.” The surge in violence comes just weeks after Afghans marked an unprecedented country-wide ceasefire between the Taliban and government forces in June, offering temporary relief to civilians. The brief respite sparked hopes the truce could clear the way for talks to end the nearly 17-year-old conflict. However the devastating attacks across the country in recent days have led many to question how such negotiations could move ahead. “Everyday we are witnessing deadly attacks in Kabul and other major cities. So, I believe the Taliban do not believe in peace talks,” said shopkeeper Shahenshah Shahin in Kabul. Analysts have suggested the Taliban may be trying to shore up its position before any potential negotiations by proving they can hit government installations at will. “The Taliban will try to have an upper hand during talks, so we can’t rule out more attacks until a ceasefire,” said Taliban expert Rahimullah Yusufzai. “It’s the fighting season and the Taliban will want to rack up victories before winter.” The group has been conducting blistering attacks on security forces across Afghanistan, including the massive, days-long onslaught on Ghazni during the past week. Small pockets of Ghazni began opening up to humanitarian aid Thursday, while partial mobile service returned after telecommunications infrastructure and government buildings were destroyed during the onslaught. The UN has warned of unconfirmed reports suggesting up to 150 civilians might have been killed in the fighting. Militant attacks and suicide bombings were the leading causes of civilian deaths in the first half of 2018, according to a recent UN report."
 Military says BIFF rebels behind Sultan Kudarat blast," ISULAN, SULTAN KUDARAT—The military on Monday blamed Sunday night’s bombing here that killed two people and wounded 12 others on a faction of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) that had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) jihadi group in the Middle East. Malacañang condemned the “dastardly attack,” the second in Isulan since August 28, when a bomb ripped through a row of used-clothes stores at Barangay Kalawag 3, killing three people and injuring 36 others. “We strongly denounce the latest attack in Isulan, Sultan Kudarat,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in a statement issued in Jerusalem, where President Duterte was on a four-day official visit. The August 28 bombing in Isulan was also blamed on the BIFF faction led by Abu Toraife. The police chief of Isulan, Supt. Celestino Danie, and the provincial police director, Senior Supt. Noel Kinazo, were sacked on Monday after the latest explosion. The death toll in Sunday night’s attack rose to two after the sister of the 18-year-old boy who was killed in the explosion that ripped through an internet café at Barangay Kalawag 2 died on Monday morning. Maria Lyn Luda, a cousin of Jan Mark Palencia Luda (not Lupa as earlier reported), died at the Sultan Kudarat provincial hospital, according to Supt. Aldrin Gonzales, spokesperson for the Police Regional Office 12. Isulan Mayor Marites Pallasigue called off classes at all levels in public and private schools as a security measure. Chief Supt. Eliseo Rasco, the regional police commander, announced the sacking of Danie and Kinazo on Monday morning, saying the order came from Philippine National Police Director General Oscar Albayalde, who was in Brunei attending a regional police conference. No one has claimed responsibility for Sunday night’s bombing, but Capt. Arvin John Encinas, spokesperson for the military in the region, said followers of Abu Toraife, leader of the BIFF faction that had pledged loyalty to IS, carried out the attack in retaliation against the military for air and ground operations in Maguindanao province that killed several fighters from the group. “They are losing men . . . that’s why they are resorting to bomb [attacks]. It’s part of their retaliation and to divert our concentration [from] them,” Encinas said. “Last night, we locked down the town as we hunted the perpetrators,” he added. Dave Bryan Leliza, 26, caretaker of the internet café, said on Monday that a male teenager carrying a paper bag arrived at 7:15 p.m. on Sunday and occupied cubicle No. 8. Leliza said the boy left after 10 minutes, and a man took the same cubicle. “Our [security cameras] recorded all these . . . [A camera] clearly showed the face of the [teenager who came in carrying a paper] bag,” he said, adding there were 15 customers at the time. Then, at 8:28 p.m., a blast tore through the internet café. “Our [computers] were flying, the ceiling falling, smoke billowing and everyone inside crying for help,” Leliza said. “I tried to help but realized I was hit in the legs and head,” he said. Leliza was one of the victims rushed to various hospitals. Doctors extracted fragments of floor tiles from his head and nails from his legs. Two of the victims, including Leliza, remained in critical condition at the hospital. Cardinal Orlando Quevedo, the archbishop of Cotabato, on Monday expressed outrage at the attack and called on Church followers “to pray for the victims and for their families.” Quevedo urged the military, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Moro National Liberation Front, both of which have signed peace agreements with the government, to flush out the perpetrators and bring them to justice. The United Kingdom and Australia on Monday renewed their warnings to their citizens against traveling to western and central Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago because of terrorist activities and clashes between the military and insurgent groups. The British advisory included warning of a possible terrorist attack in Manila."
CORRECTION: Communist groups may be behind Masbate blast,"Editor’s Note: The original title of this article was: “Communist groups may be behind Mindanao blasts — PNP.” However, the writer learned later that the PNP was only referring to the recent blast in Masbate. We regret the error and are correcting the article. Thank you. Communist groups may be behind the attack at a port in Masbate City, the Philippine National Police (PNP) said on Monday. PNP Spokesperson Senior Supt. Benigno Durana said the evidence found in the areas affected by explosion were similar to what communist groups used in other attacks. “Based on the post-blast investigation nakuha ng ating PNP crime laboratory office, nakuha nila yung mga orange PVC pipes and scattered parts of the speedboats,” Durana said in a press briefing. However, he did not specify what specific communist groups he was referring to. According to Durana, PVC pipes were the “preferred materials” of communist-terrorist groups used during their attacks. “I think there’s some basis on the initial findings of the regional director na ito ay kagagawan ng communists-terrorist group,” Durana said."
Arroyo backs martial rule extension in Mindanao after Sultan Kudarat blast," Speaker Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo is backing a proposal from Malacañang to extend martial law in Mindanao following the bombing in Isulan, Sultan Kudarat that killed two people and injured 36 others. “I support martial law in Mindanao,” Arroyo said in an ambush interview after the blessing of the Romana Pangan District Hospital in Floridablanca, Pampanga on Thursday. “I support what the President does because I’ve been president and I believe that he does not need a peanut gallery to tell him what to do,” she added. On Wednesday, Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea said extending martial rule in the southern region could be an option following the Sultan Kudarat blast. READ: Medialdea: Extending martial law in Mindanao is an option While Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said they are open to this option, Vice President Leni Robredo doubts that it could thwart future attacks. READ: Palace OK with possible martial law extension in Mindanao President Rodrigo Duterte first declared martial law in Mindanao on May 23, 2017 after the Islamic State-inspired Maute terrorist group attacked the Islamic City of Marawi. Congress later extended it until the end of 2018."
Mamasapano clash survivor among fatalities in Abra blast," A survivor of the bloody Mamasapano incident was one of the two policemen killed in the grenade explosion in La Paz town, Abra province before dawn Thursday. Police Officer 3 Carlos Bocaig, incidentally, was killed on the same day the ill-fated “Oplan Exodus” happened three years ago. Oplan Exodus was a delicate operation of the elite police group Special Action Force (SAF) against Malaysian terrorist and bomb expert Zulkifli Bin Hir, alias “Marwan”, in Mamasapano, Maguindanao in 2015. Another Mamasapano survivor told INQUIRER.net that Bocaig was a gunner in the 13-man assault team that attacked Marwan’s hut in Barangay (village) Pidsandawan. The survivor, who declined to be identified, described Bocaig as a “warrior.” Bocaig was a former member of the SAF’s seaborne unit. “Even after surviving the battle in Mamasapano, he still volunteered to join combat operations,” the police officer said in Filipino. Bocaig and another policeman were killed while securing VIPs at a town fiesta in Abra province. At least 10 others were wounded in the blast, among them Rep. Joseph Bernos and La Paz Mayor Menchie Bernos."
British MPs slam MI5 over Manchester Arena bombing,"LONDON, Nov 22 — MPs investigating Britain’s 2017 terror attacks said today that the MI5 security service missed key opportunities to stop the Manchester Arena bomber. Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee, a cross-party panel of lawmakers that scrutinises the work of government in these fields, slammed communications service providers (CSPs) for giving terrorists a “safe haven”. The ISC also said their recommendations on previous failings had gone ignored. Britain suffered five terrorist attacks in 2017: at Westminster, London Bridge, Finsbury Park and Parsons Green in London; and at the Manchester Arena, where 22 were killed in a suicide bombing. Thirty-six people were killed in total in the attacks. The Manchester Arena attack, as concert-goers were leaving an Ariana Grande show, was perpetrated by 22-year-old Salman Abedi, a Mancunian of Libyan descent. The ISC’s report said the MI5 domestic security agency missed chances to stop Abedi, moving too slowly after his case had been flagged for review and failing to consider him for referral to the anti-radicalisation scheme. Abedi also visited an extremist contact in prison on more than one occasion but no follow-up action was taken by either MI5 or the police. MI5 did not place travel monitoring or restrictions on Abedi, meaning he was allowed to return undetected from Libya to Britain shortly before the bombing. “There were a number of failures in the handling of Salman Abedi’s case and while it is impossible to say whether these would have prevented the devastating attack on May 22, we have concluded that, as a result of the failings, potential opportunities to prevent it were missed,” the ISC said. Responding to the report, UK counter-terrorism police said they would study the report’s findings “carefully”. “We are deeply committed to learning so that we can refine our response to the evolving threat,” he said. The committee found 12 “cross-cutting issues” which played a part in at least two attacks. On explosives, “the system for regulating and reporting purchases of the ingredients used to make explosives was hopelessly out of date in dealing with the threat posed,” it said, adding that it had facilitated the perpetrators’ actions. Meanwhile appeals to CSPs to tighten up their loopholes had fallen on deaf ears. The committee said that four years ago they concluded that CSPs were failing to stop their systems “being used as a safe haven for extremists and terrorists. “Yet we have seen that appeals to these companies’ sense of corporate and social responsibility have not resulted in them making the changes required — and again these loopholes were used by the perpetrators of the 2017 attacks.” The committee concluded that MI5 and counter-terror police wanted to learn from past mistakes and their determination was impressive. However, “we have previously made recommendations in all of these areas, yet the government failed to act on them. The lessons from last year’s tragic events must now result in real action”, the report said. The probe did not fully cover the bomb attack on a London Underground train at Parsons Green station, because the Home Office interior ministry did not provide full evidence in time for the inquiry. “From what we have seen to date, there were fundamental failings in the handling of this case,” the committee found, saying the “litany of errors” by the ministry, the police and the local authority necessitated a separate review.

 Military girds for more BIFF terror attacks," Security has been stepped up in densely populated areas in anticipation of more terrorist attacks after a bomb went off in Sultan Kudarat, killing three people and wounding 35 others. Military officials said Thursday that the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters, the group they blamed for the attack, has shifted tactics to gain prominence among international terrorist organizations, and have made urban centers their primary targets. Brig. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, commander of the 6th Infantry Division, said they raised the level of security awareness within his jurisdiction to thwart attacks on urban centers. “Urban centers are their target—crowded places because that’s their thrust to gain support from international terrorist organizations,” Sobejana said. He said this shift was a sign of weakness, as the terrorists are unable to confront ground troops in battle due to depleted armaments. “The emplacement of IEDs [improvised explosive devices] is a clear manifestation that they are becoming weak, they have no firepower to fight government forces,” he said. Since January, the BIFF suffered tremendous setbacks in a series of battles with security forces, particularly in Central Mindanao, losing hundreds of fighters to death or capture. Sobejana said in the Isulan, Sultan Kudarat attack, several leads pointed to the BIFF. To protect civilian communities, he said troop visibility would be increased, with more checkpoints being set up. On Thursday, the death toll in the Isulan blast rose to three after a 21-year-old man, Welmark John Lapides, died after remaining in critical condition in a General Santos City hospital, radio dzBB reported. The report cited Philippine National Police Region 12 spokesperson Supt. Aldrin Gonzales. Tuesday’s blast immediately killed a seven-year-old girl and a 52-year-old woman. Senator Panfilo Lacson said the recent attack suggested that neither martial law nor the Bangsamoro Organic Law could guarantee peace in Mindanao. Lacson said security forces, particularly in Mindanao, should avert the vicious cycle of talking peace with one group while alienating others. At the same time, an anti-terrorism bill he has proposed may give the government a much-needed boost in its fight against terrorists, since it enhances the Human Security Act of 2007 with provisions on foreign terrorists and additional predicate crimes. “While an anti-terror law in itself cannot solve the problem of terrorism, an intensified one can, however, give the government and the law enforcement agencies the much-needed tool in dealing with the emerging threats of terrorism,” said Lacson, who headed the Philippine National Police from 1999 to 2001.While he had a hand in drafting the earlier law, he said gaps in it prevented authorities from implementing it properly. He said the occupation of Marawi City by the Maute Group in 2017 “revealed the many loopholes of the current anti-terrorism law.” He noted the Philippines was ranked the 12th most affected by terrorism by the Global Terror Index in 2017. He added that the Moro Islamic Liberation Front came into being and became a dominant armed force in Mindanao after the government came to a peace agreement with the Moro National Liberation Front. The bill penalizes foreign terrorists, including those who travel to a state other than their state of residence for committing or organizing terrorist acts; and those residing abroad who come to the Philippines in transit to commit or take part in terrorist acts to target countries. Lacson’s bill adds three predicate crimes to the 12 in the present law. These are: RA 9208, Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003, RA 9165, Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 and RA 10175, Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012. Covered as well are other analogous acts that tend to cause death or serious bodily injury, or intend to cause risk to the health, safety or security of the public, or intend to seriously interfere with, disrupt or destroy critical infrastructure. Also covered are acts using weapons of mass destruction, proscribed under relevant treaties and conventions where the Philippines is a state party. The bill punishes those recruiting another person to serve in or with an armed force in a foreign state; publishing an ad or propaganda; and other acts with the intention of facilitating or promoting the recruitment of persons to serve in any capacity in or with such armed forces. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said that while it is too early to recommend an extension of martial law, he said that remains an option in dealing with terrorism in Mindanao. Speaker Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on Thursday said she supports the administration’s view on martial law in Mindanao. Arroyo’s statement came after Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea said Wednesday that extending martial law in Mindanao is an option after the Sultan Kudarat bomb attack. “I support what the President does because I have been president and I believe that he does not need a peanut gallery to tell him what to do,” Arroyo said. House Majority Leader and Camarines Sur Rep. Rolando Andaya Jr. said the House is ready to grant the President an extended martial law in Mindanao should the Chief Executive ask for it. “The declaration of martial law is the call of the executive. The President declares or extends, Congress concurs. If the President will ask for it, then it shall be given,” Andaya said. Andaya also urged the Palace to convene the National Security Council and Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council to discuss the progress of the Marawi rehabilitation program and the Bangsamoro Organic Law."
At least 18 reported killed in Baghdad explosion," BAGHDAD, June 7 — At least 18 people were killed and over 90 wounded in an explosion in Baghdad's Sadr City district yesterday, an Iraqi police source said. Photos from the scene showed a destroyed car and building as well as weeping relatives of victims. An interior ministry spokesman said in a brief statement the blast was the result of the detonation of an ammunitions cache and that security forces had opened an investigation. The ammunition had been stored in a mosque and the explosion happened during its transfer into a car parked nearby, the police source said. Earlier, state television cited a ministry spokesman describing the explosion as “a terrorist aggression on civilians,” which had caused “martyrs and wounded.” Authorities did not offer an explanation of the discrepancies between the two statements, neither of which gave casualty figures. Sadr City is a stronghold of nationalist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, whose political bloc won a May 12 parliamentary election. Parliament ordered a national recount of votes yesterday. In May, two homemade bombs targeted the headquarters of the Iraqi Communist Party, which is part of Sadr's bloc. "
At least 14 killed in Mogadishu car bombing,"At least 14 people were killed and several others wounded on Thursday when a car bomb blew up outside a popular hotel in the Somalia’s capital Mogadishu. The Al-Qaeda aligned Shabaab group said it was responsible for the blast in front of the Weheliye hotel in the city center, claiming it had targeted a gathering of government officials, army and intelligence officers. A government spokesman said 14 people had died but the toll could rise as rescuers search through the debris. “There was a heavy blast here and the number of casualties we have is so far 14 killed and a number of others wounded,” said Abdiazis Ali Ibrahim, a security ministry spokesman. “The toll could be higher,” he added. Witnesses described a big explosion on Makkah al-Mukarama street, one of the city’s busiest running through central Mogadishu, which was packed with people heading home from work at the time. “The blast was so huge, a vehicle containing explosives went off near a teashop in front of Weheliye hotel, leaving more than 10 people dead. I saw people being rushed to hospital and some of them were already dead,” said witness Abdulahi Moalim. “Most of the casualties are… people who were spending time to take tea, there was devastation and buildings were damaged,” said another witness Mohamednur Abdirahman. Mogadishu is regularly hit by bomb attacks carried out by the Shabaab which is fighting to overthrow Somalia’s internationally-backed government. The Weheliye hotel was previously attacked by Shabaab gunmen in 2015. In October last year, Somalia suffered its deadliest-ever terrorist attack in which more than 500 people were killed in a truck bombing in a busy part of the city. In the wake of that attack, Somalia’s government declared a fresh offensive against Shabaab. The United States has also stepped up the tempo of drone and missile strikes, and increased its support for ground attacks by US-trained Somali forces. The Shabaab was pushed out of the capital in 2011 — and subsequently other towns and cities — by soldiers from the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). But the Islamists still hold sway in large parts of the countryside and launch regular gun and bomb attacks on government, military and civilian targets in Mogadishu and ambushes on military convoys and outposts. East African leaders contributing to the AMISOM force last month called for the United Nations to reconsider plans to withdraw troops by December 2020, saying the timeline was unrealistic and could lead to a reversal of gains."
No sign Leicester ‘explosion’ linked to terror," LONDON, Feb 26 — British police said this morning there was no indication a reported explosion and building collapse that injured at least six people in Leicester, a central English city, was linked to terrorism. “The cause of the explosion will be the subject of a joint investigation by the police and Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service,” local police said in a statement. “We would ask that the media and public do not speculate about the circumstances surrounding the incident, but at this stage there is no indication this is terrorist related.” The apparent explosion occurred yesterday evening on a stretch of road containing commercial and residential properties close to the city centre. The electricity supply to a number of properties in the area was cut while emergency services deal with the incident, police said. The Fire and Rescue Service said it received calls shortly after 7pm from the public reporting an explosion and a building fire. It immediately dispatched six fire engines, a spokeswoman said. “We were en route when the police called to say a building had collapsed,” she added. Additional specialist search and rescue units were then dispatched, including a search and rescue dog, according to the spokeswoman. “We’ve got no indication of what the cause is at this moment,” the spokeswoman said. Six people were taken by ambulance to Leicester Royal Infirmary hospital following the incident, according to University Hospitals of Leicester, which runs three area medical facilities. “Two of these patients are in a critical condition, while four are walking wounded,” it said on Twitter. Officials had earlier advised people only to attend the accident and emergency department “if absolutely necessary”. The fire service spokeswoman also said representatives from gas and electric provider companies were in attendance at the scene, under routine procedures. Pictures and videos posted on social media showed a property engulfed in flames visible from a distance, with rubble and debris scattered around. Graeme Hudson told AFP he lives close to the scene and felt the blast. “It was very scary,” he said. “I live five minutes away... but my house shook. I went out and saw massive smoke and big flames. “I quickly went out to see what’s happened,” he added. “(I) didn’t stay for long there because (I felt) unsafe for my 11-year-old son.”"
Gunmen attack China’s consulate in Pakistan as violence flares across region," KARACHI (REUTERS) – Three suicide attackers stormed the Chinese consulate in the Pakistani city of Karachi amid a series of gunshots and an explosion on Friday (Nov 23), but were killed before they could force their way in with a car packed with explosives, police said. The attack, claimed by separatist insurgents from the impoverished southwestern Pakistani province of Baluchistan, killed four people, including two police, but it was far from the most deadly on a particularly violent day across the region. A suicide attacker on a motorbike set off explosives in a crowded festival and market in north-west Pakistan’s Orakzai region, killing at least 25 people at around the same time as the Karachi bloodshed. Over the border in eastern Afghanistan, a suicide blast at a mosque on an army base killed at least 26 people and wounded 50, security officials said. Earlier in the week, a suicide bomber killed 55 people in the capital, Kabul. The blood-letting comes as faint hopes for peace in Afghanistan have been stirred by two meetings between US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and the Taleban in Qatar. US President Donald Trump said on Thursday the United States was “in very strong” peace negotiations in Afghanistan but he did not know whether they would be successful. The attack on China’s consulate in Karachi was claimed by the separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) insurgent group that opposes Chinese projects linked to its Belt and Road initiative in resource-rich Baluchistan. Two policemen and two people waiting in a queue outside the consulate were killed in the attack, along with the three gunmen. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan called it “part of conspiracy” against Pakistani and Chinese economic and strategic cooperation and ordered an inquiry, his office said. Pakistan has long accused its old rival, India, of supporting the nationalist insurgents in Baluchistan, while India accused Pakistan of nurturing Islamist militants throughout the region. India denies helping the Baluchistan insurgents and was quick to condemn the violence. “The perpetrators of this heinous attack should be brought to justice expeditiously,” India’s foreign ministry said in a statement. India has for decades accused Pakistan of supporting Islamists fighting Indian security forces in the Indian part of the Himalayan region of Kashmir, where increasing violence flared again on Friday with Indian forces killing six militants in a clash. India and the United States also accuse Pakistan of supporting the Afghan Taleban. Pakistan denies that. As the Karachi attack unfolded, an explosion and gunshots rang out in its affluent Clifton neighbourhood and a plume of smoke rose over the area. City police chief Amir Shaikh said the three attackers came in a car filled with explosives but failed to get inside the heavily fortified compound. It was not clear if the car had exploded. “They tried to get inside, but the Rangers and police killed one of the terrorists,” Shaikh said. A gun battle broke out with the two other attackers trying to enter the visa section, but they were also killed, he said. A spokesman for the BLA confirmed there were three attackers. “China is exploiting our resources,” spokesman Jiand Baloch told Reuters by telephone. China has funded development of a deep-water port at Gwadar in south Baluchistan, and is also investing in other projects on a China Pakistan Economic Corridor. Baluchistan, which is on the borders of Afghanistan and Iran, has rich mineral and natural gas reserves but is Pakistan’s poorest province. Separatists have for decades campaigned against what they see as the unfair exploitation of resources, in particular natural gas and minerals. The Chinese government’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, said he was “shocked” by the attack and urged Pakistan to prevent any more such incidents. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said China would “continue unswervingly” to work with Pakistan to develop economic projects. The suicide bomb attack in the Afghan border province of Khost came as people gathered for Friday prayers at the mosque on the army base. The Taleban, who are waging a war to oust the Western-backed Afghan government and expel foreign forces, have launched a series of high-profile attacks against Afghan security forces in recent weeks. The blast in Pakistan’s Orakzai region was also at a Friday festive gathering. There was no claim of responsibility for either of those blasts."
Detoyato: If there was no martial law it could have been worse,"Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Public Affairs chief Colonel Noel Detoyato expressed belief that terrorist groups could have perpetrated more bombings if martial law was not declared in Mindanao. Detoyato made the comment following the deadly blast in Isulan, Sultan Kudarat, that left two people, including a seven-year-old boy, dead and 34 others wounded. “Baka kung walang martial law mas grabe pa (If there was no martial law it could have been worse).That is why the past few attempts nila lagi nating napipigilan (they were foiled) because of the so many checkpoints,” Detoyato said. He added that prior to the explosion that rocked Isulan, there were two previous attempts by terrorist to detonate an IED (improvise explosive device) in the area. “Actually in the town proper of Isulan this is already the ‘nth time na may nare-recover tayo na mga IED (that we recovered IED). Previous times we recovered it before it is detonated because of prior intel. So naaavert natin ang (So we avert the) situation,” Detoyato said. “This time there was also prior intel (report) that is why our security forces were in the area and even accosted the one who placed the.. who left the bag that exploded,” he added. Detoyato said that base on intelligence reports they received, the terrorists are going to conduct bombings in the general area of Isulan. “So that is why we are on the alert. That’s also the reason why a KM-450 military truck doing mobile patrol was also hit,” he said. Detoyato said if pattern and motivation will be the basis, the BIFF (Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters) are behind the explosion. He added that historically, Isulan town has been targeted by extremist because of the economic improvement in the area which is mostly populated by non-Muslim believers. “Nilalagyan nila ng anggulo ng religion that is why Isulan tinatarget nila.” he said. Meanwhile, Army 6th Infantry Division Chief Brig. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, said they are not discounting the possibility that the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) or Islaniyah Toraype Group was behind the explosion. He added that following the incident, Isulan town is currently calm and peaceful “Pero hindi mo maiwasan ‘yung mga constituents na nandun pa rin yung pangangamba kaya nag augment ako ng additional forces to build confidence among the populace ng Isulan (But we cannot avoid that our constituents get worried that’s why we augmented or sent additional forces to build confidence among the populace of Isulan),” Sobejana said."
110 arrested over Surabaya bombings,"Investigations into last month's Surabaya suicide bombings have led to the arrest of 110 suspects, as Indonesian police move to unravel the terrorist network behind the attacks. ""All 110 suspects are linked to one another,"" national police chief Tito Karnavian told reporters on Friday at the Bogor presidential palace, after attending the Eid al-Fitri open house by President Joko Widodo. He declined to reveal details regarding the connections between the suspects and the perpetrators of the triple-church bombings and the attack at the Surabaya police headquarters on May 13 and 14, as operations are still ongoing. ""It is also the peak of our security operations, and ensuring security is our religious duty,"" he added. Most of the suspects were nabbed in East Java, including the five men arrested last Wednesday with a plan to attack police stations and banks. Some were picked up in Central Java. Among the evidence seized during the arrests were a firearm with bullets as well as books on jihad and other radical doctrines, said General Tito. The attacks in Surabaya last month claimed 27 lives, including those of 13 perpetrators who are said to have been in sleeper cells with ties to the Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), a local terrorist group loyal to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The coordinated attacks and traces of military-grade explosives found at the blast sites suggest a rising level of tactical capability among Indonesian terrorists. But it was the fact that the militants were willing to use their wives and children as cover for suicide bombings that shocked the nation. The wide terrorist network uncovered by police in East Java has also raised concern over the rise of extremism in the province. The presence of Islamist militants in East Java, however, is not new. Ali Imron, Amrozi and Mukhlas - three brothers belonging to Jemaah Islamiah (JI) and involved in the 2002 Bali bombings - used to live in Lamongan, a sleepy town about 50km from Surabaya, the capital of East Java. More recently, in 2015, two sisters-in-law from Lamongan were deported from Turkey with their children after trying to enter ISIS-controlled territory in Syria. At the time, the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict said Lamongan's extremist community was shaped by the JI, with many of its attacks hatched and planned in the area. Before it was dismantled by counter-terrorism police in Indonesia, the JI, just like the JAD today, had also provided recruiters, fighters and propagandists for ISIS. Indonesian police will remain on high alert during the Eid al-Fitri holidays and in the weeks ahead, with regional polls, including one to elect the governor of East Java, set to take place on June 27. Security is also expected to be tight at the sentencing of JAD leader Aman Abdurrahman at a Jakarta court on Friday. He was charged with inciting other militants to commit various terror attacks in Indonesia, including an attack in Jakarta in 2016 that left four bystanders dead. Prosecutors are seeking the death sentence for the radical Indonesian cleric, who is also believed to have had a hand in the creation of the Surabaya sleeper cells. Aman had previously preached in Surabaya, and his teachings often describe democracy as ""syirik"", or idolatry, and argued that Muslims have a duty to free themselves from the system and attack instruments of the state such as the police."

"We forgive them', says son of Surabaya church bombing victim","The son of a Surabaya bombing victim has said that the family had forgiven those responsible, during the funeral for his mother, Lim, who was killed in the blast at Saint Mary Immaculate (SMTB) Catholic Church on Sunday. Kurnianto arrived on Monday at Bhayangkara Police Hospital along with his father and siblings to take his mother’s body home to Tangerang, Banten, reported kompas.com. His voice shaking, “On behalf of my mother, I apologize if she made any mistakes during her life, and please pray for her, she is now in heaven,” he said on Monday as quoted by kompas.com. “And as for the perpetrators, we forgive them and I believe my mother is in the House of the Lord.” Kurnianto said his mother was on a business trip to Surabaya with her friends, Siska and Susana, to take part in a batik exhibition. They were staying in a hotel that was actually closer to Surabaya Cathedral than SMTB church. “But this is perhaps God’s way. She went to the church in Ngagel instead, which people say is one of the oldest churches in Surabaya,” he said. According to the CCTV footage he had seen, Kurnianto said his mother was right next to the bomber’s motorcycle in front of the church when the bomb detonated. “When I saw the CCTV, I don’t know, perhaps it was God’s beautiful plan. When Mama arrived at the gate, she did not enter the church [and] she stayed there about five minutes,” he said. Kurnianto said he trusted the nation’s security apparatus and that they had been diligent. “My message to the public [is]: Please don’t judge any religions, because no religion asks [the believers] to do evil things. We believe the government has done their best for the nation and stated. And finally, God please help Indonesia,” Kurnianto said."
One dead in latest terror raid in East Java,"Members of the nation’s Densus 88 elite counterterrorism squad killed one terrorist suspect in Surabaya, East Java, on Tuesday afternoon, in the latest raid on members of a local terrorist network accused of being responsible for a string of bombings in the province. “The suspect resisted arrest and endangered the officer, so we took stern action,” East Java Police spokesman Frans Barung Mangera said on Tuesday. The officer refused to identify the 39-year-old suspect. He was the fourth suspected terrorist shot dead by police following bombings that killed 28 people, including 13 suicide bombers or their children. Previously on Monday night, the squad arrested four suspected terrorists in Malang regency, Pandaan and Surabaya. The police have not released the names of the newly arrested suspected terrorists but said they were connected to the perpetrators in the church bombings, including the family of Dita Oeprianto, who blew themselves up at three churches in the provincial capital on Sunday. The police have so far arrested 13 suspected terrorists after the bombings. They are believed to be members of the Jamaah Ansharud Daulah, the main supporter of the Islamic State group in Indonesia."
AFP exerting all efforts to ensure Indonesia terror attacks will not happen here," The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) today said it is exerting all efforts to ensure that the terrorist attacks in Indonesia will not happen here in the country. AFP spokesman Marine Col. Edgard Arevalo made the remark following an interview. “Syempre (Of course) we express our condolences at kalungkutan natin dun sa nangyaring yan sa Indonesia (and our sadness on what happened in Indonesia). Definitely, it’s something that civilized nations would condemn,” Arevalo said. “On our part, we are doing our own measures, our own efforts to maintain our desire that no terrorist attack or activity will happen here similar to Indonesia,” he added. Suspected militants on a motorcycle detonated explosives outside police headquarters in Indonesia’s second-largest city yesterday, a day after coordinated suicide bombings on three churches in the city killed at least eight people. A report from AP quoting Police spokesman Frans Barung Mangera said six civilians and four police officers were wounded in the explosion at the police complex in Surabaya. The blast came just hours after police said one family, including girls aged 9 and 12, had carried out the church bombings."
Indonesia jail siege ends after 36 hours," Indonesian police mounted a daring raid on a high-security detention centre yesterday morning, ending a two-night stand-off with more than 150 terrorist inmates. Crack commandos broke through a wall and used stun grenades to neutralise the inmates before taking back the facility in Kelapa Dua, some 36 hours after the siege started. The detention centre, just 25km from the city centre of Jakarta, houses a number of Islamist militants jailed on terror-related charges. The siege, started on Tuesday night by 156 inmates who support the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), resulted in the deaths of five officers from the counter-terrorism police force. Their bodies showed signs of torture before their throats were slit. Four other officers were injured. One of the inmates was also killed during the initial stage of the violence, which was posted on the Telegram messaging application by several perpetrators who had mobile phones. Police deployed reinforcements from the military and had them on standby and also negotiated with the inmates in a bid to secure the release of hostages. Before dawn yesterday, 145 inmates surrendered, Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs Wiranto told reporters. Just before 7.30am, an explosion and gunshots were heard at the facility. Speaking to reporters later in the morning, the deputy police chief, Commissioner General Syafruddin, said the explosion was meant ""to sterilise the site"" before officers stormed in. Police Mobile Brigade (Brimob) commander Rudy Sufahriadi added that the blast ""was to bring down a wall of a room where we figured they placed homemade bombs"". After the raid, the remaining 10 inmates surrendered. ""We dealt with this (stand-off) using a soft and persuasive approach, although our colleagues have fallen victimto their sadistic acts,"" said General Syafruddin. Police said the mayhem was sparked when inmate Wawan Kurniawan, alias Abu Afif, a member of the Jemaah Ansharut Daulah terrorist group, became furious that guards would not allow visiting family members to give him food on Tuesday. The police clarified that it was a misunderstanding, saying that officers required the meals to be inspected first. At around 8pm that night, Wawan incited other inmates to try to break free. A group of five to 10 inmates in a cell managed to break open the cell door. They then stormed into an interrogation room, where they snatched the weapon of a female officer and beat her up. She is among the four injured officers. The group went into a storeroom which holds confiscated items from raids and took assault rifles, pistols, ammunition and home-made bombs. They attacked other officers and held them hostage. Five of the hostages were killed, three were freed hours later on Tuesday, and the last one was freed at around 2am yesterday. The inmates had asked for food in exchange for the release of the last hostage, Kompas.com cited police spokesman Muhammad Iqbal as saying. Terrorism expert Haris Abu Ulya blamed the incident on the complacency of the police who underestimated what the terrorists were capable of doing. The terrorists' enormous hatred of the police and their wrong belief that the police are the accomplices of the infidels drove them to ""commit such anarchic acts and killings"", Mr Haris told Indonesia's largest radio station Elshinta. All the terrorist inmates have been transferred to Nusakambangan, Indonesia's Alcatraz-like island prison."
"Austin ‘serial bomber’ strikes again, motive still unknown","AUSTIN, March 20 — Hundreds of police officers and FBI agents searched yesterday for a mysterious “serial bomber” after a blast in the Texas state capital Austin — the fourth this month — left two young men seriously injured and the city on edge. Police said Sunday night’s explosion was connected to three previous bombings in Austin and the bomber used a tripwire in the latest attack, showing a “higher level of skill”. “We’re clearly dealing with what we expect to be a serial bomber at this point,” Austin police chief Brian Manley told reporters. But Manley said police have been unable to determine a motive for the bombings that have killed two people in the city of nearly one million people and injured another four. “Is this terrorism? Is it hate-related?” Manley asked. “As we said from the very beginning, we were not willing to classify this as terrorism, as hate, because we just don’t know enough.” In the earlier bombings, two African American men were killed by packages left on their doorsteps, raising the possibility of a racially motivated crime. A 75-year-old Hispanic woman was also injured in a blast. But Manley said the latest bombing seriously wounded two white men aged 22 and 23 as they walked along a sidewalk or on the road in a quiet residential neighborhood of southwest Austin. He said it appeared “random” and was triggered by a tripwire. “What we have seen now is a significant change from what appeared to be three very targeted attacks to what was last night an attack that would have hit a random victim that happened to walk by,” the police chief said. “We’ve definitely seen a change in the method that this suspect or suspects are using.” Manley said the use of a tripwire also means police are dealing with someone who “shows a higher level of sophistication, a higher level of skill” than initially believed. “With this tripwire, this changes things,” agreed FBI special agent Christopher Combs. “It’s more sophisticated, it’s not targeted towards individuals. “We’re very concerned that with tripwires a child could be walking down a sidewalk and hit something.” Manley appealed to the bomber to contact the authorities and to the public to report anything suspicious. “I will reach out to the suspect or suspects and ask that you contact us, ask that you reach out to us, communicate with us so that we can put this to an end,” Manley said. “There are innocent people getting hurt in this community and it needs to come to a stop.” The authorities said they were increasing the reward offered for information leading to an arrest, bringing the total city and state bounty money to US$115,000 (RM450,512). “We need every tip, every piece of information, however inconsequential you may think it is,” Manley said. A 17-year-old African American teenager, Draylen Mason, was killed on March 12 and the Hispanic woman was critically injured the same day. All of the cardboard packages were hand-delivered, not sent through the mail, and the bombs were built with household items available at hardware stores. Three Democratic members of Congress called for the bombings to be classified as “terrorist attacks” and “investigated as such.” “Also, we need to understand if these attacks are ideologically or racially motivated,” Representatives Bennie Thompson, Cedric Richmond and Sheila Jackson Lee said in a statement. “The community impacted is now under virtual house arrest and the entire city is posed to be in a state of fear -– which can easily transition into panic.” A task force of hundreds of members of law enforcement are working the case, including criminal profilers and experts from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF). Austin Mayor Steve Adler said the manhunt was the “highest priority.” “There’s an army of federal agents,” Adler said on ABC’s Good Morning America. “We’re going to find out who is responsible for this and we’re going to stop it,” he said.

Palestinian PM attacked in Gaza: What does it mean?," RAMALLAH, March 15 — Palestinian prime minister Rami Hamdallah survived an apparent assassination attempt in Hamas-ruled Gaza this week when a roadside bomb blew up near his convoy. The blast came as an October reconciliation agreement aimed at ending a decade-long split between Islamist movement Hamas and Fatah, which dominates Hamdallah’s government, edged towards collapse. Here is what is known about the incident so far and the potential impact it could have: On Tuesday, Hamdallah was beginning a rare visit to the Gaza Strip when an explosion rocked his convoy, leaving him uninjured but lightly wounding six security guards. The roadside bomb, believed to have weighed around 15 kilogrammes (33 pounds), exploded a few hundred metres from the border with Israel, shortly after Hamdallah’s convoy entered the territory. A second bomb failed to explode, officials said. Who was behind it? The short answer is that it’s not clear — there has been no claim of responsibility. Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas immediately said Hamas was responsible, since it is in charge of security in Gaza, but stopped short of accusing the group of directly carrying it out. Hamas in turn blamed Israel, which has assassinated multiple Palestinian leaders over the decades. Other suspects include smaller, more radical Islamist groups that operate in Gaza but are opposed to Hamas. A senior Hamas official narrowly survived an assassination attempt in October, believed to be the work of jihadists. The attack could also have been the work of hardline Hamas factions opposed to negotiations with the Palestinian Authority. Hamas said it had launched an investigation into the attack, detaining a number of suspects. Why was it a rare visit? Gaza, with its two million residents, forms a large part of the Palestinian territories. But since Hamas seized control in 2007, the internationally-recognised government headed by Hamdallah has had only nominal power in the Strip. Hamas controls the police, security and other government services, while Abbas’s administration is based in the West Bank. Its ministers visit only sporadically. In October, Hamas agreed to hand Gaza back to Abbas’s Palestinian Authority in an Egyptian-brokered reconciliation deal which has since faltered. Key sticking points include the fate of Hamas’s vast armed wing, which has fought three wars with Israel since 2008, and the future of tens of thousands of civil servants. Little progress has been made in recent months. Hamdallah’s attempted assassination could prove a fatal blow for any remaining hope of a negotiated handover of power. After the attack, Hamdallah said he still wanted reconciliation. But a senior Palestinian official told AFP that Abbas has suspended all official visits to Gaza for fear of further attacks. That could further complicate aid programmes in the desperately poor enclave. Israel has blockaded Gaza for a decade, its economy has slumped and residents currently receive only a few hours of electricity a day. Western governments for the most part do not communicate with Hamas, so those who want to support Gaza do so through Hamdallah’s government. His visit Tuesday was to open a wastewater treatment facility paid for by international donors. Does it increase the risk of violence? Gaza’s neighbours Egypt and Israel have expressed concern about the situation in Gaza in recent months, as fears grow that the deteriorating situation could lead to another round of conflict. Neither has opened its border, however. This week the US government held a meeting in Washington to discuss the future of Gaza — without any Palestinian representatives. It did not invite Hamas, which it considers a terrorist organisation, while Abbas and his officials are boycotting Trump’s administration over his controversial recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Global powers are meeting in Rome Thursday to try to raise money for the UN’s agency for Palestinians refugees, which faces a desperate shortage after the US froze tens of millions of dollars in funds. US President Donald Trump is expected to launch a proposal for Israeli-Palestinian peace in the coming weeks. The contents have been kept secret but Hamas has already rejected it, accusing his administration of pro-Israel bias. Any peace plan would likely be stillborn if it does not find a solution to the issues of Gaza and Hamas. "
Financier prepared Rp 200 million for Thamrin suicide bomber," man acting as a financier prepared Rp 200 million (US$14,531) along with firearms for a suicide bomber involved in the terrorist attack on Jl. MH Thamrin in Central Jakarta on Jan. 14, 2016, a witness told the South Jakarta District Court on Tuesday. Saiful Munthohir was a witness in the trial of Aman Abdurrahman, the alleged mastermind of the gun and bomb attack that killed eight people, including five terrorists. Some 20 others, police officers and civilians, were injured. Saiful said suicide bomber Muhammad Ali was given Rp 200 million from someone named Rohis. “For amaliyah [a religious practice] a total of Rp 200 million was needed,” said Saiful as quoted by kompas.com. Along with the Rp 200 million, Rohis also provided several firearms to be used by the attackers. Two of the firearms were shown in court and confirmed by Saiful as the weapons provided. According to Saiful, only Rp 75 million of the money was used in the attack and he did not know where the rest of the money went. Muhammad Ali and four of his fellow bombers were killed in the attack, namely Sugito, Dian Juni, Sunakim alias Afif, and Ahmad Muhazan. Sugito and Dian Juni died on Jl. Thamrin in a bomb blast at a traffic police post located in the middle of the road. Afif and Muhammad Ali were shot by the police in the parking lot of Starbucks café, while Ahmad Muhazan blew himself up inside Starbucks. "
Five officers testify in court over Kampung Melayu suicide bombings,"Five police officers have testified in the South Jakarta District Court on Friday on the 2017 Kampung Melayu twin suicide bombings in East Jakarta, allegedly masterminded by terrorist convict Aman Abdurrahman. Imprisoned radical cleric Aman, who is also a supporter of the Islamic State (IS), is  also facing another trial on the 2016 suicide bombing on Jl. MH Thamrin in Central Jakarta. The South Jakarta court’s presiding judge, Akhmad Jaini, asked the five officers, M. Ersyad Alfart, M. Novriansyah, Purwoko, M. Rizki and Kandinan Malin, about the state of the Kampung Melayu bus terminal moments before the blast occurred on May 24, 2017. Three of their colleagues, who were escorting a traditional parade to welcome the Islamic fasting month of Ramadhan, were killed in the blast. Ersyad explained that he and several police officers were waiting for the parade, which had been scheduled to pass the terminal in the evening. Nothing peculiar had happened at that time, but at around 8:50 p.m., the police officers heard two explosions from a nearby Transjakarta bus stop. “After the explosions, I saw the bodies of my friends, Taufan, Gilang and Ridho, lying on the street,” Ersyad recalled, adding that shortly after, another explosion occurred. Witness Purwoko said the three victims were at a parking area near the bus stop, when the blast took place. “Around 25 minutes before the incident happened, I talked with Taufan, while I was repositioning my motorcycle,” Purwoko said as reported by kompas.com. The cleric has been serving his sentence in Nusakambangan maximum security prison in Central Java since 2010 for raising funds for a militant training camp in Aceh province. "
Burkina Faso hit by multiple terror attacks,"OUAGADOUGOU - Armed assailants attacked several targets in Burkina Faso's capital yesterday, including the army headquarters and the French embassy, in a coordinated assault that France's ambassador to the West African region called a terrorist attack. It was the third major attack in Ouagadougou in just over two years. There was no immediate claim of responsibility but previous attacks were conducted by allies of Al-Qaeda in reprisal for Burkina Faso's participation in a regional fight against Islamist militants. A Burkina Faso government statement said four gunmen were ""neutralised"" at the French embassy, adding that operations were continuing and there was no immediate information on civilian casualties. The defence minister said three assailants were killed at the army headquarters. Witnesses said masked gunmen attacked the downtown army headquarters at about 10am. ""I saw people with sacks on their backs attack the guard. Then I heard the explosion. I saw soldiers flee the army headquarters building running,"" witness Kader Sanou told Reuters. The explosion rocked the compound, setting the building on fire and sending up a thick column of black smoke. Panicked residents fled the city centre on foot or motorbikes as dozens of Burkina Faso special forces and armoured vehicles took up positions in the area. ""Burkinabe security forces are mobilised against the attackers with the support of security forces at our embassy,"" said French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian in a statement. The French targets attacked, including the cultural centre, are symbolic given that French President Emmanuel Macron chose to outline his Africa strategy, including the fight against militants, in November in Ouagadougou. France's ambassador to Burkina Faso Xavier Lapeyre de Cabanes confirmed to Reuters that the embassy compound, around 2km from the army headquarters, also came under attack but gave no further details. France's embassy and cultural institute in Ouagadougou are no longer in danger, an aide to Mr le Drian said. Police took up position near the offices of the prime minister where gunfire was also reported. Mr Macron was being kept up to date with events in Ouagadougou, the Elysee Palace said in a statement. A Reuters reporter said gunfire had largely ceased by noon. Islamist militants have stepped up attacks in major cities in West Africa in the last few years, including deadly assaults in Mali, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast and Niger. Suspected militants killed at least 18 people last August during a raid on a restaurant in Ouagadougou, and militants have targeted Burkinabe security forces along its remote northern border region with Mali."
Gunmen attack French embassy and army headquarters in Burkina Faso," Gunmen attacked the army’s headquarters in the capital of Burkina Faso on Friday as well as the downtown area and France’s embassy, and the French ambassador said an explosion in the city was a terrorist attack. It was not clear who was behind the violence but Burkina Faso and other West African countries have been targeted by jihadist groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State in the past few years. A local news station showed pictures of black smoke coming from a building in central Ouagadougou and a Reuters correspondent found that most people had fled the streets. “Attack under way at the French Embassy and French Institute. Stay hidden where you are,” the embassy said in a statement posted on its Facebook site. A French official in Paris confirmed that an assault against the embassy was under way, as well as against the Burkina Faso army headquarters. An explosion rocked the army headquarters and then gunfire rang out in the vicinity. A witness said masked gunmen with backpacks had attacked the army headquarters shortly before the explosion. Islamist militants have gained a stronger foothold in Africa’s vast Sahel region in the last few years, launching attacks in Mali, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast and Niger. Suspected jihadists killed at least 18 people last August during a raid on a restaurant in Ouagadougou, and militants have targeted Burkinabe security forces along its remote northern border region with Mali. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) claimed responsibility for an attack on a restaurant and hotel in Ouagadougou in January 2016 in which 30 people were killed. Five countries launched a new task force last year to tackle Islamist militants in the region, to which international donors have committed half a billion dollars. Jean-Marc Châtaigner, France’s ambassador to West Africa’s Sahel region, tweeted:“Terrorist attack this morning in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso: solidarity with colleagues and Burkinabe friends.” He urged people to avoid the city center. After the first big blast, the sound of a series of smaller explosions and exchanges of gunfire came from the direction of the headquarters. It ceased by around noon."
 Jokowi allows Abu Bakar Baasyir to receive treatment at hospital," President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has granted convicted terrorist Abu Bakar Baasyir permission to be temporarily relocated to a hospital for medical treatment over his declining health. The ailing radical cleric, who is currently serving his sentence at Gunung Sindur prison in Bogor, West Java, is reported to have been admitted to Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital in Jakarta because of swelling in his legs, possibly due to clogged blood vessels. “This is about humanity, which I think also applies to all. If there are [prisoners] who suffer from an illness, it’s our job to admit [them] to a hospital to get treatment,” Jokowi told journalists on Thursday. Baasyir, the spiritual leader of radical group Jamaah Ansharut Tauhid, has been in prison for nearly seven years after the Jakarta District Court sentenced him to 15 years' imprisonment in 2011. He was found guilty of funding a military training camp for a terrorist group in Aceh. The 79-year-old cleric was initially locked up in a high-security prison in Nusakambangan in Cilacap, Central Java. Due to his declining health, authorities relocated him to Gunung Sindur prison in 2016. Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) chairman Maaruf Amin previously called on the President to grant clemency or consider a sentence reduction because of concerns over Baasyir's health. However, when asked about whether the President would grant a sentence reduction, Jokowi said, “I have yet to receive any [sentence reduction] letter.” "
MUI chief calls on Jokowi to grant clemency to Abu Bakar Baasyir,"The chairman of Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), Maruf Amin, has called on President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo to grant clemency or a sentence reduction to radical cleric and terrorist convict Abu Bakar Baasyir due to his failing health. “If possible, the President can grant him a clemency. But it’s up to him,” Maruf told reporters on Wednesday, as reported by tempo.co. Baasyir has been in prison for nearly seven years after being sentenced to 15 years by the South Jakarta District Court in 2011. The court found him guilty of funding a military training camp for a terrorist group in Aceh. The 79-year-old spiritual leader of Jamaah Ansharut Tauhid was initially locked up in a high security prison in Nusakambangan in Cilacap, Central Java. However, due to his declining health, authorities relocated him to Gunung Sindur prison in Bogor, West Java, in 2016. Maruf also asked Jokowi to allow Baasyir to be admitted to hospital. “I have expressed that to the President and his response was good,” he said without giving further details. Meanwhile, presidential spokesman Johan Budi Saptopribowo refused to comment on the proposal, saying that he needed to confirm with the President first. The Law and Human Rights Ministry granted Baasyir a third three-month sentence cut on Independence Day on August 17 last year. The ailing radical cleric was admitted to Harapan Kita Hospital last year after developing swollen feet due to clogged blood vessels."
Nigerian troops foil Boko Haram attack on base: Army,"KANO, Nigeria (AFP) – Nigerian troops foiled an attempt by Boko Haram fighters to overrun a military base in the restive northeast leaving six soldiers wounded, the army said on Saturday. Troops “successfully repelled a Boko Haram terrorist attack” on a base in the town of Arge in Borno state on Friday, army spokesman Texas Chukwu said in a statement. “Several members of the Boko Haram terrorists were neutralised while others fled with gunshot wounds during the encounter,” he said. “Unfortunately, six soldiers sustained various degrees of injuries and are currently receiving medical attention at the military facility.” Chukwu said three Boko Haram trucks were destroyed and one other vehicle recovered in the latest attack in the area. On August 29, Islamic State (IS)-affiliated Boko Haram extremists claimed to have killed “several” Nigerian soldiers in mortar strikes on the Arge military base. The claim could not be independently verified. Boko Haram’s IS extremist group-backed faction – known as the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) – operates in the Lake Chad region and has in recent months intensified attacks on military bases in Borno and nearby Yobe state. The attacks are seen as a sign of a hardline takeover in ISWAP by more radical lieutenants who executed the group’s de facto leader because of his opposition to indiscriminate killings and willingness to hold peace talks with the government. Scores of soldiers have been killed, injured or missing in attacks but the military have repeatedly denied or played down losses to the extremists."
Duterte is ISIS target in India says report; Palace remains unfazed,"President Rodrigo Duterte remained unfazed with the latest report that he was a target of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) while he is in an official trip in India. “[Duterte] will not cower to threats from ISIS nor any other terrorist groups,” Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said in a statement reacting to story by “The Print” of India. The Print published a report saying Duterte “is on the radar of the Islamic State… is giving security agencies sleepless nights” as he attends a regional summit with Indian and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) leaders. Duterte, along with 10 other Asean leaders is also set to attend the Republic Day in New Delhi on Friday. The Print, quoting a security agency source, said the ISIS terrorists “has mobilized its people and is planning to strike.” But Roque said Duterte was “unmoved by this latest threat and will be unrelenting in his fight against violent extremism.” “All precautions though are being taken by the PSG [Presidential Security Group] and Indian authorities,” he said. “Security arrangements by both PSG and Indian police are in place. We will all be there for and with him,” he added. Duterte, Roque said, “has pledged to serve the Filipino people and has left the issue of his mortality to the Creator.”"
Afghan president names team for Taliban peace talks,"Afghanistan’s President Ashraf Ghani on Wednesday announced a 12-person team for prospective peace talks with the Taliban, as his government pledged unwavering commitment to resolve the conflict despite persistent bloodshed. The Afghan government, Western diplomats and United Nations officials have in recent weeks raised hopes of finally reaching a deal to end the Taliban’s 17-year insurgency. Such optimism has been tempered by continuing attacks, including a massive blast outside a British security company’s compound in Kabul late Wednesday — claimed by the Taliban — which killed at least 10 people. The latest violence came just hours after Ghani told an international conference in Geneva that his government had formed a 12-person negotiating team, comprised of both men and women, to talk peace with the Taliban. It will be led Ghani’s chief of staff, Abdul Salam Rahimi, a former humanitarian worker and ex-deputy Afghan finance minister who is considered one of the president’s closest aides. US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who met with the Taliban in Qatar earlier this month, had been pushing Ghani to announce a negotiating team. The president also laid out what he termed a “roadmap” for the talks and four principles that he said must form the backbone of any agreement. They include respecting Afghanistan’s constitution and the total rejection of interference in domestic affairs by foreign “terrorist” and criminal groups. “We seek a peace agreement in which the Afghan Taliban would be included in a democratic and inclusive society,” Ghani said. ‘Stars lining up’ Addressing reporters at the end of the conference that saw major donors pledge sustained commitment to the Kabul government, Afghanistan’s national security advisor Hamdullah Mohib said Wednesday’s bomb blast would not deter from the peace push. “Events like this bolster our resolve for peace,” he said. “We have put our step forward,” he added. “The ball is now in the court of the Taliban.” Kabul has offered to meet face-to-face with the Taliban without preconditions, but the insurgents have not yet committed to direct negotiations. Asked why he was confident negotiations were possible despite the violence and the Taliban’s lack of public commitment, Mohib claimed the militants were facing renewed pressure to talk, including from foreign backers. “We see the stars lining up for peace at this point.” Civil society activists in Geneva for the conference voiced concern that in pursuing a deal the Kabul government might give ground on women’s rights to the Taliban, a group notorious for its oppressive treatment of women. Ghani’s government has won praise for trying to redress extreme gender gaps in Afghanistan and the president assured diplomats that he would not compromise on women’s rights to strike a deal. Rare opportunity In a message read to the conference from UN chief Antonio Guterres, deputy under-secretary general Rosemary A. DiCarlo said: “We may have a rare opportunity to move to direct peace talks between the Afghan Government and the Taliban.” European Union foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini told the conference the bloc believed “it is time for concrete talks about peace to begin”. The EU was prepared to act as the “guarantor” of the negotiations, she added. Ghani said earlier this month it was “not a question of if, but when” an agreement would be reached with the Taliban. Khalilzad has said he is “cautiously optimistic” for an end to the conflict."
"Task force eyed to quell violence, terror acts","The Department of Justice is consideringthat will investigate individuals who may be linked to “lawless or terrorist acts” in areas where the government recently sent troops to quell violence, Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said Saturday. The justice chief made the statement a day after Presidentto Bicol, Samar and Negros provinces to suppress “lawless violence.” According to Guevarra, his department is called upon to probe and prosecute those who might be arrested for criminal acts. In a related development, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said more troops might be deployed to areas controlled by communist to suppress “lawless violence” in the runup to the 2019 midterm elections . Lorenzana’s statement followed President Duterte’s order for more soldiers to be stationed in Bicol, Samar and the Negros provinces citing a “number of [recent] sporadic acts of violence” there. Lorenzana said these areas were considered “critical” during elections since the guerrillas stop candidates from campaigning unless they paid the rebels an undisclosed amount of money. Under Memorandum Order 32, signed by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, the executive sent more government forces to Bicol, Samar, and Negros provinces where a “number of sporadic acts of violence” recently occurred. The order “merely reiterates and reinforces” a similar directive Duterte issued in 2016, Guevarra said.Duterte issued his third Memo in September 2016 when he declared a “state of national emergency on account of lawless violence in Mindanao” after a blast in Davao City killed at least 12 people and injured several others. Officials said the military was still assessing the pre-election scenarios in other areas. The government earlier canceled peace negotiations with the communist movement following continued attacks on government troops despite current talks. According to Lorenzana, the suppression of lawless violence might lead to the extension of military rule in Mindanao, Lorenzana said, but added this would not lead to a declaration of a nationwide martial law. Martial law has been in place in Mindanao since May 2017, at the start of firefights between soldiers and terrorists in Marawi City. It was extended despite the end of the siege in October last year, with government citing remaining threats in the area. Its extension is set to lapse by the end of the year."
Prosecutors demand life for Dortmund bus bomber,"FRANKFURT, Nov 19 — German prosecutors asked a court today to sentence a man accused of an April 2017 bomb attack on Borussia Dortmund’s team bus to life in prison. Defendant Sergej Wenergold committed almost 30 attempted murders by attacking the bus with three improvised bombs as it left the team’s hotel, lead prosecutor Carsten Dombert said. He also faces charges of causing an explosion and two counts of causing serious injury, with judges expected to deliver their verdict next week. The Russian-born German citizen has admitted to placing the bombs, but claims he did not aim to kill anyone—each contained up to a kilogramme (2.2 pounds) of a hydrogen peroxide mixture and dozens of metal bolts. Prosecutors say he in fact aimed to kill as many players as possible, hoping to profit financially after buying so-called put options—essentially a bet on the club’s share price falling. Wenergold left letters supposed to hint at an Islamist terrorist background at the scene, as well as  far left or far right extremist groups. But police eventually joined the dots after realising that the trained electrician had stayed in the same hotel as the Dortmund players on the eve of their Champions’ League match against Monaco. Hidden in a hedge, the explosives were badly positioned and in the end succeeded only in breaking Spanish defender Marc Bartra’s wrist and damaging a police officer’s hearing. Several Dortmund players including Bartra gave emotional testimony during the trial about the trauma they suffered during the attack."
Bahrain sentences four to death for killing policeman,"DUBAI, Nov 12 — Bahrain’s top criminal court today sentenced four Shiite Muslims to death for a 2017 bombing that killed a policeman in the Sunni-ruled kingdom, a judicial official and the public prosecutor said. A statement by the prosecutor’s office said the four were found guilty on charges of premeditated murder and possession of unlicensed arms “with terrorist aims” over the June 18, 2017 bombing. A police officer was killed in the blast in Diraz, a flashpoint village outside the capital Manama. A judicial source involved in the case, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said all four of those sentenced were Shiite Muslims. Only one of them is in custody, according to the London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, which said the three others were tried in absentia. Bahrain, a tiny Gulf state located between regional rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran, has been hit by waves of unrest since 2011, when security forces crushed protests led by majority Shiites demanding an elected prime minister. Authorities have since jailed hundreds of dissidents and stripped many of citizenship, banning all opposition groups under court orders. Diraz in particular has been rocked by protests, police raids, riots and sporadic bombings. The village is home to Bahrain’s top Shiite cleric, Sheikh Isa Qassim, who was stripped of citizenship in 2016 and is under house arrest. Bahraini authorities accuse Shiite Iran of provoking unrest in the kingdom, which Tehran denies. Rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have criticised many of the trials as politically motivated and said they fail to meet basic standards of due process. Monday’s verdict comes ahead of controversial parliamentary elections that Bahrain’s King Hamad has called for November 24 in the key US ally, which is home to the US Fifth Fleet and a permanent British military base. Dissolved opposition parties, including the Shiite Al-Wefaq and secular Al-Waad, do not have the right to put forward their own candidates in the vote. "
US jury convicts New York subway bomber,"A US jury convicted a Brooklyn immigrant from Bangladesh of terrorism on Tuesday for detonating a bomb in a crowded New York subway passage near Times Square in the name of the Islamic State group. Akayed Ullah, 28, who migrated to the United States in 2011, was found guilty by a unanimous jury as Americans went to the polls in the midterm elections. His trial in Manhattan lasted a week. The December 11, 2017 blast wounded Ullah and three other people in a tunnel below the Port Authority bus terminal, not far from iconic Times Square. The bomb, which he strapped to his body with zip wires, failed to detonate as planned, and Ullah was left with burns to his torso and hands. His victims suffered minor complaints such as ringing in their ears and headaches. But the explosion sowed panic and disrupted the morning commute during the busy Christmas tourism season, six weeks after another a truck driver, also reportedly inspired by the IS group, killed eight people on a bike path. Ullah, a driver, was convicted on all six counts and faces a maximum sentence of life behind bars when he is sentenced on April 5, 2019. His convictions include supporting a foreign terrorist organization, using a weapon of mass destruction and bombing a public place. He was caught on CCTV walking through the subway terminal and detonating the bomb strapped to his body. After his arrest, he allegedly told authorities: ""I did it for the Islamic State."" ""Today, Ullah stands convicted, he faces a potential life sentence, and his purpose failed. New York City remains a shining symbol of freedom and hope,"" said Geoffrey Berman, the top US federal prosecutor in Manhattan. Ullah built the bomb in his apartment, packing the device with metal screws and Christmas tree lights, having planned the attack for several weeks. On the morning of the bombing, Ullah posted a statement on Facebook referring to the US president saying: ""Trump you failed to protect your nation."" A chilling handwritten note saying ""O America die in your rage"" was found, along with metal pipes, wires and screws in his home, prosecutors said. Ullah began to radicalize in 2014, three years after moving to the United States, by watching IS propaganda online before starting to research how to make bombs a year ago, officials said. Prosecutors say he opposed US government policies in the Middle East and wanted to terrorize as many people as possible, deliberately choosing a week day when the area would be most crowded."
"Netherlands foils 'major terrorist attack', 7 arrested","WRITER: AFP THE HAGUE - Dutch police arrested seven men Thursday suspected of plotting to carry out a ""major terrorist attack"" at a public event using explosive belts and an AK-47 assault rifle, the public prosecutor's office said. Police officers conduct an investigation at the residence of an alleged jihadist in Rotterdam on September 27, 2018 ""Police arrested seven men on Thursday... suspected of being at a very advanced stage of preparation for a major terrorist attack in the Netherlands,"" it said in a statement, adding one of the suspects had wanted to kill ""many victims"". Prosecutors and investigators were ""convinced that a terrorist attack was prevented"" as a result of the arrests in the cities of Arnhem and Weert which followed a months-long police operation. Officers had placed a group of people under surveillance, a central figure being a 34-year-old man of Iraqi origin convicted in 2017 of attempting to reach territory controlled by the jihadist Islamic State group, the statement added. Those arrested by elite special anti-terrorist police teams with helicopter support ranged in age from 21 to 34. The suspects came from Arnhem, the port city of Rotterdam and villages close to those two cities. Two others in the group also had convictions related to attempts to travel to Iraq or Syria. ""One of the men from Arnhem wanted to commit an attack with a group at a major event in the Netherlands and kill many victims, according to the Dutch Intelligence Service (AIVD),"" the prosecutor's office said. Police had yet to identify the target of the planned attack which the prosecutor's office said was to have included a separate car bombing. The suspects, who investigators said said were in possession of small arms when they were detained, are expected to appear in court in Rotterdam on Friday. ""They were seeking AK-47 assault rifles, grenades, explosive belts and raw materials with which to make other bombs,"" investigators said. - Dutch on alert - The arrests came three months after two men were arrested in Rotterdam on suspicion of preparing attacks in France and in the Netherlands. Prosecutors said earlier this month they were ""close"" to launching their attack. There has been no mention of what the target in France might have been. In the Netherlands the pair are said to have staked out and ""identified several possible targets"" in Rotterdam, including ""a police station and the Erasmus Bridge"", the country's second largest. On August 31, an Afghan aged 19 and with a German residence permit stabbed and injured two American tourists at Amsterdam's busy Central Station before being shot. The prosecutor's office said he had chosen the Netherlands for the attack believing Islam to be ""frequently insulted"" there. The Amsterdam incident came following a Taliban call for attacks on Dutch troops after far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders organised a Prophet Muhammed cartoon competition. Many Muslims consider images of the prophet to be blasphemous. The likelihood of a terror attack in the Netherlands ""remained substantial"", the Dutch anti-terror agency NCTV said last week, with terror threat levels remaining at level four out of five."
Military to continue Operation vs Reds,"DESPITE the Norwegian government’s earlier commitment to support peace negotiations with the communist rebels, the military will continue to launch anti-insurgency campaign to wipe them out for threatening to kill a soldier a day, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said. “While we all want peace, we cannot see the sincerity of the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army of the Philippines [CCP-NPA] to have a genuine peace talks,’ Roque said over a radio interview. “”, (For now, there’s no peace talks as fighting continues. They (rebels) are talking with gun fires and targeting Filipinos”, Roque said. ‘So why would the government insist on the peace dialogue when the rebels don’t want peace,” he said, adding, “so war against the CPP-NPA will continue.” Roque said CPP founder Jose Maria “Joma” Sison has threatened the Duterte administration of killing a soldier every day. But President Rodrigo Duterte answered back at the communist leader’s threat and said that he would order the military to kill five NPA rebels for every soldier killed by the rebels. “The message is, ‘You don’t threaten us, Joma Sison. We are the state. If we haven’t eradicated you, it’s because we opted not to eradicate you as Filipinos. But if you want war, we’re ready to go to war,’” Roque said.In fact, Duterte has raised the P20,000 bounty to P25,000 for each communist rebel killed by government forces to save on anti-insurgency costs. “You kill an NPA today and I’ll pay you P25,000,” Duterte said in a speech at an air base in Cebu City, referring to NPA guerrillas. In November last year, Duterte issued a proclamation formally ending peace negotiations with communist rebels. The President signed proclamation 360 declaring the termination of peace negotiations with the NDF-CPP-NPA. The President considered the communist group as terrorist. However, the government official clarified that the military is only going after the NPA, the armed unit of the CPP which has waged a 50-year-old insurgency. The government will use all available assets of the Armed Forces to wipe out the communist rebels, Roque said."
 Several dead in operation to arrest pilot,"CARACAS?Several people, including two police officers, were killed in an operation to capture a helicopter pilot who bombed Venezuela’s Supreme Court during anti-government protests last year, the interior ministry said Monday. A ministry statement said members of a “terrorist cell” were killed in a fierce gun battle, and five were captured, but did not say whether the pilot, Oscar Perez, was among the dead or detained. Six police were wounded, President Nicolas Maduro told lawmakers. The cell had planned to set off a car bomb outside the embassy of “a beloved and prestigious country,” Maduro said. Reports said Perez and associates were holed up for hours in a house 25 kilometers northwest of Caracas during the raid. Perez released videos on Instagram in which he said authorities were trying to kill him and his people even though they wanted to surrender.  Press reports said Perez did in fact die in the raid. At the height of street protests against Maduro last June, Perez and unidentified accomplices flew over Caracas in a police helicopter and dropped four grenades on the Supreme Court before opening fire on the interior ministry. There were no casualties. Perez has been on the run since Venezuelan authorities issued an arrest warrant through Interpol after accusing him of a “terrorist attack.” The 36-year-old former elite police officer and actor has regularly taunted the government during his time in hiding, saying he was fighting against Maduro’s “tyranny” and the “narco-dictatorship.”  He urged Venezuelans “not to lose heart. Fight, take to the streets, it is time we are free.” Two weeks after the attack on the Supreme Court, Perez -- at the time Venezuela’s most-wanted man -- turned up at a Caracas ceremony to commemorate those who had died in the wave of anti-government protests. In all, 125 people were killed between April and July as authorities used force to put down protests to unseat Maduro. Eventually, the protests fizzled out and the socialist president prevailed, despite a staggering crisis caused by falling oil prices, spiraling inflation and corruption. “These terrorists, who were heavily armed with high-caliber weapons, opened fire on the officials responsible for their capture,” the interior ministry statement said. It said those who resisted had been killed.The police were “attacked violently” when they were negotiating the surrender of Perez’s group, it said, adding that they had “tried to detonate a vehicle loaded with explosives.” AFP journalists trying to reach the area saw an army tank, special forces and ambulances rush to the scene.  Perez said in a video released on Twitter earlier Monday that he and his companions were surrounded and pinned down by police marksmen at El Junquito on the outskirts of Caracas. “They are firing at us with grenade launchers. We said we are going to surrender but they do not want to let us surrender. They want to kill us,” a bloody-faced Perez said in one of the videos posted online. Perez, a former elite police officer, is seen with other men in one of the videos, some of them armed. He said they were being besieged by snipers. “We will die standing up defending our land, never kneeling before the tyrants,” another of Perez’s messages said. The vice president of the ruling Socialist party, Diosdado Cabello, said on Twitter the Police Special Action Force (FAES) had launched the operation to arrest Perez. He said the security forces had “responded with fire” when two officers were wounded in the operation. Iris Varela, Venezuela’s minister with responsibility for prisons, rejoiced at the news that police had finally cornered Perez “like a rat.” “What a coward now that he has been caught like a rat. Where is the courage he had to attack military units, kill and injure officers and steal weapons?” she wrote on Twitter. In December, Perez claimed responsibility for an attack on a military base in the country’s north, in which weapons were seized. Perez said in a message to his children that his fight against the government was dedicated to them and to the children of Venezuela, suffering the worst of the food and medicine shortages caused by the economic crisis. Perez, blond and blue-eyed, was well known to Venezuelans even before his attack on the Supreme Court?as an actor. He starred in the film “Muerte Suspendida” (Suspended Death), an action movie based on the true story of the kidnapping of a Portuguese businessman in Caracas."
Colombian army: 16 Farc dissidents killed in border operation,"BOGOTA, June 14 ? Sixteen dissident members of Colombian former guerrilla group Farc were killed in a military operation on the border with Venezuela, the army said yesterday. “We will not lower our guard against these criminals,” President Juan Manuel Santos wrote on Twitter. The operation was carried out in the municipality of Fortul, in the South American country's department of Arauca, the army statement said. The statement gave few details of the military action, but Defense Minister Luis Carlos Villegas told reporters that a prominent rebel commander, Alex Rendon, could be among the dead. The army said the group was responsible for attacks on a local hospital, oil infrastructure and security forces in the area. It said the group had combined with local leaders of the National Liberation Army, or ELN by its Spanish acronym, to try to control drug trafficking in the departments of Arauca, Boyaca and Casanare, as well as coordinate “extortion activities, arms trafficking and the articulation of terrorist plans.” The ELN is currently in peace talks with Santos' government. Santos signed a 2016 peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), the country's largest rebel group, which has since transformed into a political party. But around 1,200 dissident combatants refused to lay down their arms and continue to operate in various parts of Colombia. This was the biggest operation yet against the rebel holdouts. "
Fall of wife of Malaysian terrorist Marwan weakens Jemaah Islamiah: Philippine police,"CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY (PHILIPPINE DAILY INQUIRER/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - The arrest on Sunday (Feb 25) of the wife of slain Malaysian terrorist Zulkifli Hir, or Marwan, has weakened the South-east Asian terror group Jemaah Islamiah (JI), according to the Northern Mindanao police. Police, however, were still on high alert for retaliatory attacks by JI and other terror groups, according to Superintendent Lemuel Gonda, spokesman for the Northern Mindanao police. Gonda said police were not taking any chances since remnants of JI in the Philippines, who have also pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terror group, appeared to be regrouping after the loss of key leaders and the arrest of Juromee Dongon, wife of Marwan. Marwan was killed in a police operation in 2015 that also resulted in the massacre of 44 elite police officers in Mamasapano town, Maguindanao province. Dongon and four other terror suspects were arrested in separate raids in Tubod and Baroy towns in Lanao del Norte province on Sunday. The arrests, plus the death of Marwan, dealt a severe blow to JI, Gonda said. He described Dongon, who was also formerly married to Abu Sayyaf leader Khadaffy Janjalani, as a ""high-profile"" JI member who played a key role in the terror group's operations even after Marwan's death. Dongon, according to Gonda, gave JI ""all forms of support, from access to financial sources to networking with associates and other terror groups"". JI was still a major concern of police, Gonda said, adding that the terror group was ""evolving"". ""They are getting in touch with other groups,"" Gonda added. Captain Jo-ann Petinglay, spokesman for the Western Mindanao Command based in Zamboanga City, said the military had monitored several trips by Dongon to Marawi City shortly before ISIS followers tried to set up a base there. Dongon, according to Petinglay, was familiar with Marawi because she studied at Mindanao State University. Dongon was also ""verified"" to be the secretary-general and finance officer of ""a local JI group"", Petinglay said."
Egyptian army says 16 militants killed in Sinai operation,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Sixteen militants were killed and four arrested in a major security operation launched by Egypt on Friday, the Egyptian military said on Sunday (Feb 11), the first casualties in a campaign aimed at crushing insurgents behind a string of attacks. The military also said in a statement carried by state television that 66 targets, arms depots and SUVs and motor-bikes used by militants were destroyed in raids focused mainly in Sinai, but also including parts of the Nile Delta and the western desert. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who is seeking re-election in March, ordered the armed forces in November to defeat militants within three months after an attack on a mosque killed more than 300 people, the deadliest such incident in the Arab world's most populous country. Islamist insurgents have been targeting security forces since 2013 when the army, then led by Sisi as army chief, ousted President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood following mass protests against his rule. The operation involves troops from the Egyptian air force, navy and ground forces as well as the police and border guards. ""The air force targeted and destroyed 66 targets used by terrorist elements to hide from air and artillery attacks, and to escape from their bases during raids,"" the statement said. A total of 16 militants were killed, it said. The statement also said forces involved in the operation found a media centre with computers, communication equipment and books and documents related to extremist ideology. Security forces also uncovered and destroyed six farms used to grow banned narcotics, the statement said."
France’s Macron warns Turkey over Syrian operation,"PARIS, Jan 31 — French President Emmanuel Macron warned Turkey that its operation against Kurdish militias in northern Syria should not become an excuse to invade the country and said he wanted Ankara to coordinate its action with its allies. “If it turns out that this operation takes a turn other than to fight a potential terrorist threat to the Turkish border and becomes an invasion operation, (then) this becomes a real problem for us,” Macon said in an interview with Le Figaro newspaper published today."
"Suspected terrorist, Pinay girlfriend arrested in Malate"," A suspected leader of an international terrorist group and his Filipina companion were arrested in a joint counter-terrorism operation conducted by the Philippine National Police (PNP) and Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) in Manila over the weekend. Assorted firearms, ammunition, components for improvised explosive device (IED), and a black ISIS flag were seized from the two suspects. The PNP identified the suspects as Fehmi Lassqued alias John Rasheed Lassqued, 33,said to be an Egyptian national; and AnabelMonceraSalipada, 32, of Upi, Maguindanao. Both were presented Monday by PNP Chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa and Brigadier General BienvenidoDatuinJr, commander of AFP-Civil Relations Service (CRS), at the PNP headquarters in Camp Crame, Quezon City. According to Dela Rosa, Lassqued had served as a negotiator between the ISIS leadership and local government officials in Syria and Turkey, and a former ISIS commander in the Syrian-Turkish border. He now serves as an active ISIS recruiter of Filipino terrorist fighters, Dela Rosa said. Lassqued had entered the country in mid July 2016 via Iran,using a fake Tunisian passport. He has denied being an Egyptian, saying he is half Tunisian and half Libyan. He has admitted using a fake Tunisian passport. “Ever since, he’s been in and out of Manila,”Dela Rosa told reporters. Dela Rosa said Lassqued and Salipada were arrested at Room 409 of Casa Blanca Apartment on M. Adriatico St., Malate, Manila, late Friday by virtue of a search warrant issued by a local court. Assorted firearms, ammunition, components for improvised explosive device (IED), and a black ISIS flag were seized from the two suspects. Dela Rosa told reporters that they had “received information from our foreign counterparts about Lassqued.” “Then we did a case buildup and it turned out the information was positive. We applied the search warrant.” The possibility that Lassqued has already made contact with interested Filipino terrorists was considered by Dela Rosa. “If he can recruit via the Internet, how much more if he is already here. He has physical contact with possible recruits,” he added. The two suspects are now detained at the PNP Camp Crame in Quezon City It was learned that Lassqued made five foreign outings since he arrived in the country – three trips to and from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and two trips to and from Istanbul, Turkey – from July 26, 2016 to November 9, 2017. Aside from foreign trips, authorities are now searching for the places the suspect visited in the Philippines. He said Lassqued might have recruited via social media networks and personal visits in conflict-afflicted areas in the country. Meanwhile, National Capital Region Police Office Director Oscar Albayalde said that Lassqued might have been offering financial assistance to prospected recruits to entice them to join the ISIS. “One factor is finance. Apparently, he can sneak in money into the country. We have yet to determine how much money is involved,” he said. Albayalde also said there were indications that Lassqued was planning a terror attack because of the drawings of maps of unidentifiable places confiscated from him. “There are indications (of possible terror plot) because we found some drawings, maps. We will conduct our final tactical interrogation and only then will we know other details,” Albayalde said. According to authorities, Salipada denied any involvement in the alleged terrorist activities of Lassqued. Albayalde said Salipada might have been used as a cover for the terrorist acts of Lassqued. “For cover, not necessarily she knew what she was doing but usually, if you want to remain in a specific place for a long time, you will look for a partner, or wife to make your stay legal,” he explained. Dela Rosa assured that the public is still safe and security remains on high alert. “We are continuously conducting close coordination with airport authorities. It is a good thing that this terrorist was arrested, that means we’re still safe,”Dela Rosa said. Meanwhile, Datuin said that the excellent collaboration and cooperation between the military and the PNP should be credited for the arrest of the suspected terrorist and his Filipina companion. “Napakaganda nitong success ng joint operations of the AFP and PNP (The successful joint operations of the AFP and PNP is beautiful). Makikitanatinang (We can see the) collaboration and cooperation with the two sectors, two important forces in the security sector and I just hope natuloytuloynaito (that this will continue),”Datuin said. AFP Spokesman Marine Col. Edgard Arevalo said the inspiring result of the joint AFP-PNP operation “is also a proof of what a robust intelligence sharing and collaboration can do to keep our nation and its people safe.” The Department of Justice (DOJ) is set to conduct a preliminary investigation over the criminal raps filed against Lassqued and Moncera. Senior Assistant State Prosecutor Peter Ong said the foreigner and his Filipina girlfriend yesterday met their lawyer from the Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) and decided to execute a waiver to their arbitrary detention and proceed with the preliminary investigation. “They decided to execute a waiver and to submit their counter-affidavit next week Wednesday, February 28,” Ong said. Lassqued and Monsera were subjected to inquest proceedings before Ong on Sunday in Fort Bonifacio in Taguig City over the criminal raps filed by the National Capital Region Police Office-Regional Intelligence Division (NCRPO-RPIOU) for illegal possession of firearms and ammunition under Republic Act (RA) 10591, the Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunition Regulation Act of 2013); and illegal possession of explosives under RA 9516, the Act amending Presidential Decree 1866. Ong noted that during Sunday’s proceedings the two had no lawyer and he suggested that they go to the DOJ Monday to meet with PAO lawyers who can represent them. Lassqued claimed that the weapon and IEDs have been planted by police. “They want to make a case and make themselves as heroes. They catch big terrorist, international like that,” he told reporters as he denied being a member of ISIS and has been involved in planning terrorist attacks. Lassqued said he participated in the 2011 revolution which unseated slain Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. “I joined the revolution against Gaddafi. The NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) helped us to remove Gaddafi,” he said.He said that after that, he was forced to leave the country using a fake passport."
"Suspected terrorist, Filipina girlfriend arrested in Malate, Manila by AFP","A suspected foreign ISIS (Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) leader and his alleged Filipina girlfriend were arrested in a joint counter-terrorism operation conducted by the Philippine National Police (PNP) and Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) in Manila over the weekend.

 Police start security operation a month ahead of British royal wedding,"LONDON (REUTERS) - Police in Windsor, where Prince Harry marries American actress Meghan Markle next month, said on Thursday (April 19) they had begun one of the biggest security operations in their history to ensure the event passes off safely. Harry, 33, and Markle, 36, will tie the knot on May 19 at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, the home of the prince's grandmother which dominates the town about 30km west of London. More than 100,000 visitors are expected to descend on Windsor to celebrate the wedding and police have said that barriers to stop vehicle attacks, armed patrols, and airport-style security would be deployed to prevent any incident. Specialist explosive detection dogs from Thames Valley Police searched the town on Thursday, examining mail boxes, phone booths and drains for signs of potential explosive devices. ""This is a large operation for any police force and one of the biggest I have worked on,"" said police search coordinator Andy Turner. ""We of course want it to all go smoothly."" Britain is on its second-highest threat level - severe - meaning an attack is considered highly likely. Last year, there were five incidents classified as terrorism, in which 36 people were killed. Police said shops and buildings would be searched in the days leading up to the wedding. British Transport Police also said they would have both covert and highly visible officers across London and southeast England on the day, with firearms units at key stations. ""We've worked closely with our partners at other police forces, local authorities and train companies to ensure that we can respond quickly and decisively to any incident - whatever it may be,"" said Chief Superintendent John Conaghan. Bob Broadhurst, the officer who was in charge of policing the 2011 wedding of Harry's elder brother William to wife Kate, has said there several issues police would have to be prepared for. ""It is impossible to search tens of thousands of people who want to come and line the streets, any one of which could be a potential terrorist; someone who's besotted with the royal family - and there are a number of those; or just an attention-seeker,"" he told Reuters earlier this month. He said officers had dealt with 18 protests on the day of the 2011 wedding, which passed off without incident, but there were complaints from campaigners that police had been heavy-handed. The anti-monarchist Republic group said it had written to the local police chief asking for assurances peaceful protests would not be stopped this time. ""The monarchy is a contested institution and, while this is a private wedding, all major royal events such as this are used as PR for the monarchy,"" wrote Graham Smith, Republic's chief executive."
Turkey detains students after Erdogan's 'terrorist' rebuke,"ISTANBUL (AFP) - Turkish police on Sunday (March 25) were holding seven students from a prestigious Istanbul university after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused them of behaving like ""terrorists"" for staging an action opposing his military campaign in Syria. Police stormed a students' dormitory and a house at Bogazici University around dawn Sunday (March 25) and detained three students - two men and one woman, lawyer Inayet Aksu told AFP. With the latest detentions, the number of students being held by the police rose to seven, he added. Erdogan on Saturday had slammed anti-war students at Bogazici University as ""terrorists"" as tensions rose on the campus over divided views of Turkey's cross-border military campaign in Syria. A group of students this week opened a stand handing out sweets or Turkish delight they had dubbed ""Afrin delight"" in memory of the fallen soldiers in the army's almost two-month operation to capture the city from a Syrian Kurdish militia force. In a show of protest, another group of students unfurled anti-war banners. Aksu told AFP the detentions began on Thursday (March 22), based on the video recordings. ""An (anti-war) expression could disturb certain quarters but it cannot be considered a crime under the Turkish penal code,"" he said. In his blistering attack, Erdogan labelled the anti-war students as ""communists"" and ""terrorists"" and the other group as ""believers"". ""While this youth was distributing sweets there, that communist, traitor youths dared to storm their stand,"" Erdogan said to his Justice and Development Party (AKP) at a provincial congress in Samsun on the Black Sea. Erdogan said an investigation was being launched and vowed to identify the anti-war students. Ankara in January launched an offensive in the enclave of Afrin in Syria to root out the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) militia, which Turkey brands a terrorist group. On March 18, Turkish forces and their rebel allies took full control of Afrin, with the YPG largely withdrawing without a fight. In Turkey, police have detained over 500 people for social media posts and protests speaking out against the military offensive in Syria. The crackdown - which has also targeted the national medical association - has raised alarm bells over the state of freedom of expression under Erdogan who has blasted opponents of the Syria campaign as ""traitors."" Kati Piri, the European Parliament's Turkey rapporteur, took on Twitter to protest Erdogan's latest salvo targeting anti-war students. ""Anti-war protesters labelled 'terrorists' by President Erdogan. Critical thinking dangerous endeavour in 'new Turkey'"", she wrote."
Communications stop order necessary for security operations against terrorist incidents,"We refer to the Forum letters published last Friday on the Public Order and Safety (Special Powers) Bill (Bystander photos, videos could deter more attacks, by Mr Ivan Teo; Balance communications ban during attacks with need to stay informed, by Mr Sean Lim; and More police powers welcome but allow media to report facts, by Mr Rajasegaran Ramasamy). A Communications Stop Order (CSO) is necessary to ensure that security operations undertaken by police officers are not compromised by unauthorised communications, and to avoid jeopardising the safety of officers and members of the public involved in the operations. If the Commissioner of Police assesses that it is necessary to activate the CSO for these reasons, it will be in force in the specific location where the operation is ongoing, for the duration of the operation. We have seen from overseas terror attacks that such powers are necessary to effectively deal with present-day terror attacks. Leakage of information to the terrorists in, for example, the Mumbai attacks in 2008 and Paris Hyper Cacher supermarket attack in 2015, endangered both the lives of security officers responding to the attacks, and members of the public caught in it. During last year's Las Vegas shooting incident, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department had to urge the public not to livestream or share tactical positions of officers on the scene, to avoid putting emergency responders in danger. The police will communicate the activation of the CSO to the public through various platforms (including print, broadcast and social media), and also on the ground if need be. When the CSO is in force, the making or communicating of videos or pictures of the specified location, and the communicating of text or audio messages about the ongoing security operations in the incident area, are prohibited. However, the public can still submit information to the police via the 999 hotline, or through the iWitness and SGSecure mobile applications. The police will also not take action against those caught up in the incident who made such communications, for example, people trapped in the incident location trying to get messages out."
Malaysian Al Qaeda scientist who tried to produce WMD to be released from jail next year,"KUALA LUMPUR: A Malaysian scientist who once led Al Qaeda’s quest to produce weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in Afghanistan will be released from prison next year, according to Malaysian police, who warn that he remains a security risk. Yazid Sufaat, 54, an Al Qaeda operative who helped set up a laboratory in Kandahar, Afghanistan where he tried to cultivate anthrax, has been jailed three times by Malaysian authorities for terror-related offences in the past 16 years. “He (Yazid) will be released in the middle of next year,” Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay, head of Malaysian police's Special Branch counterterrorism division, told the International Association for Counterterrorism and Security Professionals (IACSP) on Monday (Aug 27). The Special Branch is the intelligence arm of the Royal Malaysian Police and the leading agency in counter-terrorism operations in the country. Yazid, a former army captain, was detained for eight years under the Internal Security Act (ISA) between 2002 and 2010. The ISA was replaced by the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act (SOSMA) in 2012. After Yazid's release, he started recruiting new members for Islamic State in Syria. In 2013, he was re-arrested again under SOSMA and was imprisoned for four years in a Tapah prison in Perak state. Then in 2017, he was re-arrested and detained for two years, after it was found that he had been recruiting fellow inmates for Al Qaeda during his incarceration in Perak. “The fact that he indulged in terrorism-related activities after his release from the ISA and embarked on a recruitment drive among prisoners at the Tapah prison clearly show that he is unrepentant,” Ayob told Channel NewsAsia on Wednesday (Aug 29). But counterterrorism expert Ahmad El-Muhammady, who interviewed Yazid in prison in November 2016, believes he would not take up arms again. “I sense exhaustion, loneliness in him (Yazid) due to the long (prison) sentence. He just wants to return home,” Ahmad, a lecturer from International Islamic University Malaysia, told Channel News Asia. “I don’t deny his radical ideas remain to a certain extent. Behaviour-wise, I believe he would abandon terrorism.” But asked whether terror groups will look for Yazid after his release given his skills as a bio-chemistry scientist, he said “they might”. “The question is, does he want to sacrifice his freedom after such a long absence from his beloved family? From what I observe he will not,” said Ahmad. Yazid is married with three daughters. While in prison, Yazid commanded the respect of his fellow inmates as a senior Al Qaeda operative, making it easy for him to recruit members for the terror group in the Tapah prison, Ahmad said. “Inmates respected him due to his stature in Al Qaeda, experience, seniority and knowledge. None of the other detainees matched the breadth of his experience,” said Ahmad. Yazid, a former army captain, is a graduate of biological science and chemistry from California State University, US. According to Professor Zachary Abuza of the National War College in Washington DC, Yazid came close to producing mass biological weapons together with Hambali, Al Qaeda’s Southeast Asia leader. “At the time of 9/11, he (Yazid) and Hambali, Al Qaeda's chief of operations in Southeast Asia, were in Kandahar, where they were hoping to take a virulent strain of anthrax into possession,” said Prof Abuza who specialises in terrorism and insurgencies in Southeast Asia. “They had all the facilities and know-how to mass produce the biological weapon. What they did not have was the Ames stain of anthrax, the most lethal strain that is used in anthrax weapons.” Yazid also bought 21 tonnes of ammonium nitrate to be used in terror attacks in Singapore. “At the time of his arrest, he had already dispatched four tonnes of ammonium nitrate,” said Prof Abuza, adding that the rest of the material was eventually found."
Clashes leave 27 dead as Yemen troops target Al-Qaeda,"Eight soldiers and 19 suspected members of Al-Qaeda were killed in Yemen on Sunday, as the army launched an offensive against key outposts of the extremists, a military official said. General Faraj al-Bahsani, governor of Hadramawt province, told AFP the army had taken control of the Mesini Valley west of Mukalla, a central site for Al-Qaeda in southeast of the country. Mukalla was the most populated Yemeni city under direct Al-Qaeda control from 2015 to 2016, when the army and its regional military allies seized control of the port city. Special forces trained by the United Arab Emirates -- a key member of a Saudi-led alliance fighting alongside Yemen's government forces -- over the weekend launched the offensive, codenamed ""Al-Faisal"", against Al-Qaeda cells in oil-rich Hadramawt province. Two soldiers were killed on Saturday in the offensive, which targets the Mesini and Amed Valleys -- both in the vast province of Hadramawt and home to Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). The two valleys are critical to control over Yemen's southeastern coastline. More than 9,200 people have been killed in the Yemen war since 2015, when the Saudi-led coalition joined the government's fight against Iran-backed Huthi rebels. Radical groups, including AQAP and the Islamic State group, have flourished in the chaos of the war, regularly launching attacks on government and military targets. The United States, the only force known to operate armed drones over Yemen, has ramped up a long-running campaign against AQAP since President Donald Trump took office in 2017."
Turkey designates Syria's Tahrir al-Sham as terrorist group," ISTANBUL: Turkey has designated the insurgent group Tahrir al-Sham as a terrorist organisation, according to a presidential decision published on Friday, as Damascus prepares for a military assault in northwest Syria where the group holds sway. The notice in the Official Gazette matches a decision by the United Nations in June to add Tahrir al-Sham to the list of people and organisations whose assets are to be frozen because of links to militant groups al Qaeda and Islamic State. It comes before an expected attack by the Syrian army, backed by Russia, on the northwestern Syrian region of Idlib which is home to nearly 3 million people on the border with Turkey. Tahrir al-Sham, which includes the al Qaeda-linked group formerly known as Nusra Front, is the most powerful jihadist alliance in Idlib, the last major rebel-controlled enclave outside Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's control. Russia said on Friday the Syrian government had every right to chase terrorists out of Idlib, adding that talks were underway to set up humanitarian corridors there. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said last week it would be disastrous to seek a military solution in Idlib, even though there were militants there. Ankara, which has a small military presence in Idlib, has warned an assault could unleash a fresh wave of refugees. ""It is important for all of us to neutralise these radical groups,"" he said. ""But we have to distinguish the civilians from the terrorist groups."" U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said on Thursday there was a high concentration of foreign fighters in Idlib, including an estimated 10,000 who he said belonged to Nusra Front and al Qaeda. But he said there should be no rush to military action and called for more time for Russia, Turkey and Iran to discuss the situation in Idlib. The decision to add Tahrir al-Sham to the list of designated groups was taken by President Tayyip Erdogan. Ankara had already listed Nusra Front as a terrorist group. Erdogan is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at a three-way summit in Iran on Sept. 7."
"France clamps down on radical Islam in prisons, schools","PARIS, Feb 23 ? The French government said today it would seal off extremists within prisons and open new centres to reintegrate returning jihadists into society as part of a plan to halt the spread of radical Islam. France is experimenting with various ways of ending the drift towards extremism of young people growing up on the margins of society, in predominantly immigrant suburbs where organisations like the Islamic State group or Al-Qaeda recruit. The plan unveiled today is the third in four years and aims to draw lessons from past failures, after three years marked by a series of attacks that left over 240 people dead. “No one has a magic formula for ‘deradicalisation’ as if you might de-install dangerous software,” Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said in the northern city of Lille where he presented his strategy, flanked by a dozen ministers. “But in France and elsewhere there are good approaches to prevention and disengagement.” France is particularly keen to stop extremism flourishing in its prisons, where some of the jihadists behind attacks in recent years first came under the spell of hardliners. A total of 512 people are currently serving time for terrorism offences in France and a further 1,139 prisoners have been flagged up as being radicalised. To prevent extremism spreading further, Philippe said he would create 1,500 places in separate prison wings “especially for radicalised inmates”. He also announced plans for three new centres that will attempt to reintegrate radicals referred by French courts, including jihadists returning from fallen IS strongholds in the Middle East. A first de-radicalisation trial ended in failure last July, with a centre in western France that operated on a voluntary basis shutting after less than a year with no improvements to show. ? Investments in psychological care for returning children of jihadists. So far 68 children have been repatriated, most of them under 13. ? Tighter controls on private Islamic schools which have grown rapidly in number in recent years. ? More training for teachers to help them detect early signs of radicalisation and to debunk conspiracy theories. ? More investment in teaching students to separate fact from rumour on the internet. ? Making it easier to reassign public servants that show signs of radicalisation to jobs that do not involve contact with the public."
Pakistan takes radical Sunni leader off terrorist watchlist ahead of election," ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has removed the leader of one of the country's largest Islamist extremist groups from its terrorist watchlist while the Election Commission considers whether his group can field candidates in a general election next month, an official said on Thursday. Muhammad Ahmed Ludhianvi is head of Ahl-e-Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ), a radical Sunni group that has incited violence against Pakistan's minority Shi'ite Muslims. ASWJ shares roots with the more violent Lashkar-e-Jhangvi militant group based in central Punjab province, which had strong ties to al Qaeda and has waged a deadly campaign against Shi'ites for more than two decades. Who authorised the removal of Ludhianvi from the terrorist list is unclear, as a caretaker government is running Pakistan during the two months of campaigning ahead of the July 25 general election. The ASWJ has registered dozens of candidates to stand in poll, using another name for their party, but their candidacy has been challenged because of the group's inclusion on the terrorist watchlist. Hasan Askari Rizvi, the caretaker chief minister of Punjab province, confirmed the removal of the ban on Ludhianvi and said his assets would be unfrozen and he would be free to travel. ""Punjab Government is implementing decisions of Election Commission and the federal government in this regard,"" Rizvi told Reuters. ""The election commission will decide today in a meeting whether his group can contest the election."" The election pits the former ruling party of ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif - who was disqualified from office last year by the Supreme Court - against opposition figure Imran Khan's party as well as the Pakistan People's Party led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardar, the son of assassinated leader Benazir Bhutto. Islamist parties have seldom had a major impact at elections, though they have created a high profile and possess a solid vote bank and have at times, according to analysts, enjoyed covert support from Pakistan's intelligence agencies. Ludhianvi has made forays into politics before. The Sunni cleric is best known for fomenting hatred against the country's minority Shi'ites, but he has recently shown signs of seeking to rehabilitate his group's image. Earlier this year, he was one of more than 1,800 Pakistani Muslim clerics who signed an Islamic directive, or fatwa, forbidding suicide bombings, in a book unveiled by the government. He was a leader of Sipah-e-Sahaba (SSP), a sectarian Sunni group which emerged in the southern Punjab area of Jhang in the mid-1980s with the support of Pakistani intelligence and which was later linked to hundreds of killings of Shi’ites. A splinter group of SSP, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ), evolved into one of Pakistan’s most feared militant groups and has claimed responsibility for many attacks on Shi’ites, including a series of bombings that killed almost 200 people in the southwestern city of Quetta in 2013."
Easy for them to blend in': Foreign terror suspects pose security challenges for Malaysian authorities,"KUALA LUMPUR: When Malaysian police announced the arrest of eight terror suspects last Friday (Nov 16), it highlighted a particular problem authorities here face. That of foreigners entering Malaysia legally but who then go on to pursue militant activities. Seven of the eight suspects arrested last week were Filipinos, with some of them working in the country as labourers or construction workers in the eastern state of Sabah. The police said they were suspected of various activities, including recruiting children in the Philippines to be used as human shields and kidnap-for-ransom activities. The latest raids brought the total number of terror suspects arrested in Malaysia since 2013 to 445. More than a quarter of them - 128 - were foreigners. Some of these foreigners were directly involved in a number of attacks that were being planned by extremists, according to authorities. “We have foiled 23 terror attacks since 2013 - out of which three of those plots involved foreigners,” Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay, head of Malaysia's Special Branch counter-terrorism division, told Channel NewsAsia. The three plots, involving two Filipinos and two Indonesians, were disrupted in 2015, 2017 and 2018, said Ayob, who declined to elaborate further. Last year, Malaysian police said they had foiled a plan by the Abu Sayyaf Group to attack the closing ceremony of the Southeast Asian Games in Kuala Lumpur. The foreign suspects who have been arrested over the years have either been members or had ties with Islamic State (IS), Al-Qaeda, Pakistan’s Lashkar e-Taiba - the group behind the 2008 Mumbai attack - Abu Sayyaf, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and others. Filipinos comprised the largest group of foreign militants with 46 suspects detained, most of whom were alleged to be from the Abu Sayyaf, Ayob said. Indonesians represent the second largest group with 35 people arrested. Of the 445 terror suspects arrested since 2013, 189 suspects were charged in court with 161 of those convicted and jailed. Another 114 were freed, while 50 foreign terror suspects were deported, said the Special Branch. With police constantly on the trail of suspected foreign terror suspects, experts suggest that there are a number of factors which make Malaysia a popular destination for extremists looking to pursue activities outside their own countries. ""Malaysia is regarded as a Muslim-friendly country; also, visas are not needed for some Middle Easterners. This is exploited by foreign terrorist fighters,"" said counter-terrorism expert Ahmad el-Muhammady. ""And it's easy for them to blend in given the fact that many Middle Eastern communities are in Malaysia."" He added: ""There should also be better vetting of arrivals from Arab countries with well-trained (immigration) officers (who can speak) Arabic."" A former intelligence official, who investigated the 9/11 operatives who came to  Malaysia in 1999, told Channel NewsAsia it was not surprising that Al-Qaeda members were still coming to Malaysia. ""It shouldn't surprise us anymore,"" he said, requesting anonymity. ""It's easy to enter this country and lie low for a period of time. It could also suggest they have a support network here."" Foreign terrorists come to Malaysia for myriad reasons: Some are on the run from authorities in their own countries, some are seeking to raise funds. “Terror groups like Al-Qaeda have their own funds while JI and IS exploit the issue of oppression against Muslims to collect funds in Malaysia,” said Ayob. Adding to the challenge for the intelligence forces is the suspicion that Malaysia’s borders are more porous than they should be because of corrupt officials who do not conduct the proper security checks. ""It is imperative for the government to look into corruption at the entry and exit points of the country,"" said counter-terrorism expert Ahmad. In March 2017, police arrested an immigration officer in Sandakan, Sabah who allegedly helped arrange for IS militants from Indonesia and Malaysia to enter the eastern state before heading on to southern Philippines. And in September this year, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission arrested six immigration officers who allegedly assisted about 15 human smuggling syndicates to enable blacklisted locals and foreigners, including hardcore criminals, to enter and exit via Kuala Lumpur International Airport and other international airports in the country. On Nov 15, Malaysian police said that shortcomings in the immigration department's e-visa system had resulted in some people being allowed to enter the country despite being blacklisted or having criminal records. Deputy inspector-general of police Noor Rashid Ibrahim was quoted by Bernama as saying the weaknesses could pose a major threat to the country. ""So far, we are still collecting information and making analysis,"" he said. ""When the information is enough, we will conduct a special operation."" Recent arrests have shown that some terror suspects have managed to live and work undetected for years before being caught by police. Some of them set up their own companies either to hide their activities or to eke out a living while on the run from authorities back home. Others have worked as security guards, construction workers or petty traders. At least seven Abu Sayyaf members were working as security guards when they were arrested, according to police. The Philippines-based Abu Sayyaf is an IS-linked kidnap-for-ransom group known for beheading its victims when they fail to pay ransoms. Some foreign militants have worked as teachers spreading radical Salafi jihadi teachings, which underpin global terrorist groups like IS and Al-Qaeda. On Sep 24, police arrested seven foreigners and one Malaysian for spreading Salafi jihadi teachings in the northern state of Perlis. The foreigners comprised five Europeans, one American and a Middle Easterner. The threat from foreign extremists who are Al-Qaeda members or those who have links with the organisation is a growing concern for Malaysian authorities. Last October, the Special Branch arrested a 50-year-old former Al-Qaeda member in Selangor. The detained Egyptian suspect was an executive manager in an advertising company that he had set up. His firm promotes a property company from a Gulf state. “At this point, we only know that he set up his own company here. Investigations are still ongoing,” said counter-terrorism chief Ayob. Inspector-General of Police Mohd Fuzi Harun also said that the suspect had previously been jailed in Canada and Egypt for his involvement in terror activities and for using fake travel documents. “We need to conduct operations to disrupt Al-Qaeda because they have tried to use Malaysia as a base to plot their terror attacks,” said Ayob. ""Previously, the operatives of the 9/11 attacks quietly entered Malaysia in December 1999 to discuss the plot and then left and made their way to the US to carry out the attack in 2001."" In 1995, a senior Al-Qaeda member, Wali Khan Amin Shah, a co-conspirator in the plot to blow up 12 US-registered airliners in Asia, was also arrested in Malaysia. “Wali Khan had set up a company in Malaysia named Konsojaya Sendirian Berhad as a cover for his terror activities in Malaysia,” said Ayob, who investigated the case. Ayob warned of an Al-Qaeda resurgence as he called for vigilance. ""We have intel that shows that Al-Qaeda is strengthening its forces and their strategy is to be active again after the fall of IS.”"
Jihadists pull heavy weapons from Syria buffer zone as deadline nears,"Jihadist factions including Syria’s former Al-Qaeda branch have withdrawn heavy weapons from parts of a planned buffer zone in Idlib province, a monitor said Monday, two days ahead of a deadline. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham “and other less influential jihadist groups have withdrawn their heavy weapons from large areas of the demilitarised zone” ringing Idlib province, said Rami Abdel Rahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The development comes ahead of Wednesday’s cut-off date for all rebels to withdraw heavy arms from a 15 to 20-kilometre (9-12 mile) demilitarised area ringing the Idlib region. The creation of a buffer zone is central to an agreement reached last month by regime ally Russia and rebel backer Turkey, which is aimed at staving off a massive assault on Idlib by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces. The deal also foresees radical groups leaving the area by October 15. HTS, which is led by former Al-Qaeda fighters, has yet to comment on its reported withdrawal or announce its stance on the buffer zone deal. According to the Britain-based Observatory, the pullout quietly began two days ago. “Until now, heavy weapons have been removed from northern Hama and eastern Idlib” located in the proposed zone, Abdel Rahman said. The Idlib region includes most of the province of the same name, as well as adjacent parts of the Hama and Aleppo provinces. In recent weeks, Turkey has deployed troops at “observation posts” it set up in rebel-held areas of Idlib and neighboring Aleppo. A local source close to HTS said Ankara’s actions demonstrated that neither Turkey, Russia, nor fellow regime ally Iran plan to break the deal. “The presence of Turkish forces and their posts will prevent any military action,” the source said. “So (HTS), like other factions, is moving heavy weapons and reinforcing its positions according to the agreement.” The source confirmed each faction “will remain in its position”, indicating that HTS and the other groups were “ready and prepared” to rebel any attack by the regime. HTS and other hardliners hold a large part of Idlib province and the proposed demilitarised zone, while the National Liberation Front is the main Turkey-backed rebel alliance in the area. On Monday, the NLF completed withdrawing heavy arms from the zone, according to Turkish state media. The start of the NLF pullout was confirmed to AFP by its spokesman Naji Mustafa. Despite progress in implementing the terms of the deal, Assad on Sunday said the arrangement would not become permanent. “The agreement is a temporary measure through which the state has realized many achievements on the ground starting with stemming the bloodshed,” he was quoted as saying by state news agency SANA. “This province and other Syrian territories still under terrorist control will return to the Syrian state,” the president said, referring to both rebels and jihadists. Forces loyal to Assad have retaken swathes of territory in Syria since Russia entered the war in September 2015. Air strikes attributed to Russia have killed more than 18,000 people since its intervention, according to the Observatory. The Syrian civil war has killed more than 360,000 people since it started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests."
" Russia-Turkey alliance surviving Idlib test, for now"," ISTANBUL, Aug 28 — Russia and Turkey are in intense negotiations to ensure the rebel-held province of Idlib does not become a breaking point in their alliance on Syria, but the long term fate of the area still risks provoking a rupture, analysts say. President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan have spearheaded an unlikely but so far sustained partnership to bring peace to Syria since late 2016, despite being in theory on opposite sides of the civil war. The cooperation now faces its biggest test over Syria’s northwestern province of Idlib, bordering Turkey, which Syrian President Bashar al-Assad wants to recapture to complete a string of military successes. Idlib has over the last years become an increasingly densely-populated region where problems in resolving the seven-year Syrian civil war were effectively dumped to be resolved at a later date. That moment is now drawing closer with expectations of a government offensive and fears over the combustible mix in the province of displaced people from other Syrian regions, moderate rebels and Islamist radicals. Erdogan has been a champion of the anti-Assad rebels and bitterly denounced Putin in the crisis that followed the shooting down of a Russian war plane by Turkey in November 2015. But the burgeoning alliance with Moscow, which also includes cooperation in trade, energy and defence, is now of critical importance to Ankara at a time when a crisis in relations with the US has caused the Turkish lira to bleed value. “There is still a hope in Moscow to find an agreement with Ankara that could allow the Syrian regime to take control of Idlib without a new rupture with Turkey,” Kerim Has, a Moscow-based analyst on Turkish-Russian relations, told AFP. He said Moscow was carefully watching Turkey-US ties and could launch a full operation at the “moment when the Turkish leadership is in most desperate need of the Kremlin’s encouragement during a deepening Turkey-US crisis.” Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu on Friday led a delegation including Defence Minister Hulusi Akar and spy chief Hakan Fidan to Moscow to discuss the Idlib situation and also Moscow’s planned delivery of S-400 missile systems to Turkey. Cavusoglu warned that a “military solution” in Idlib, which he said is now home to 3.5 million people, would be a “catastrophe” and provoke a new refugee influx into Turkey where three million Syrians already live. But he also said “radical groups and terrorists” in Idlib should be “neutralised”, in comments seen as indicating Ankara could support a limited intervention. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said a differentiation should be made between moderate rebels and extremists, like the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group (HTS) who control much of Idlib. In a sign of the importance of the visit, Cavusoglu was received by President Putin, who praised the “deep cooperation” over Syria. Cavusoglu told Putin “your dear friend Mr Erdogan” expected him in Istanbul soon for dinner at a fish restaurant. “Russia and Turkey are trying to find agreement with suitable terms for both sides,” Timur Akhmetov, Ankara-based researcher at the Russian International Affairs Council, told AFP. He predicted Russia and the Syrian regime would launch a “limited offensive” against groups linked to former al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front — especially on factions that have irritated Moscow by launching swarm attacks with drones against its Hmeimim base, the heart of Russian operations in Syria. “Russia is trying to encourage Turkey to have the opposition contribute to the offensive and in return, these groups will be spared from air attacks,” Akhmetov added. Yet, as has been the case repeatedly for Idlib, a limited offensive will only temporarily sidestep the key issue, namely who will control the province long-term and eventually postwar. And even if Russia can agree a compromise, it is not always the case that Assad automatically follows Moscow’s line or that his other main ally Iran backs the Kremlin. “The Russians and the Turks will be hard pressed to reach a sustainable, long-term agreement acceptable to the regime in northwestern Syria,” Elizabeth Teoman, Turkey analyst for the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), told AFP. Turkey has set up 12 so-called observation points in Idlib staffed by its military, ostensibly aimed at monitoring a de-escalation zone but which also serve to protect Ankara’s interests. Teoman said Erdogan could contemplate a possible limited offensive — with Russian and Turkish interests overlapping for now on limiting a refugee influx and promoting reconstruction in Idlib. She said the current discussions likely did not represent an “imminent breaking point” between Moscow and Ankara but warned: “Turkey’s aspirations are in direct opposition to Assad’s goals to crush the remnants of the Syrian rebellion.”"
Deadline passes for Syria’s Idlib buffer without jihadists leaving," IDLIB, Oct 15 — A deadline passed this morning without jihadists leaving a planned buffer zone around Syria’s last major rebel bastion of Idlib as set out under a Russian-Turkish deal. The radical fighters were supposed to withdraw from the buffer as a final condition to implementing a Russian-Turkish deal to stave off a regime offensive on the northwestern region of Idlib. The accord hung in the balance on the early hours of this morning, seven years into a grinding civil war that has killed more than 360,000 people and displaced millions. Just hours before the cut-off time, Idlib’s dominant jihadist group vowed to continue to fight but did not give a clear position on the deal reached in the Russia resort of Sochi. “We have not abandoned our choice of jihad and fighting towards implementing our blessed revolution,” said Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an alliance led by the jihadists of Al-Qaeda’s former Syrian affiliate. “We appreciate the efforts of all those who strive inside and abroad to protect the liberated area,” it said in an apparent reference to Turkey. “But at the same time, we warn of the deceitfulness of the Russian occupier,” it said of the regime’s ally. Under the accord, heavy weapons were meant to have been withdrawn from the horseshoe-shaped buffer by October 10 and radical fighters were meant to have left by this morning. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it had not observed any jihadists leaving the outlined demilitarised area by the time midnight struck. And deadly mortar rounds fired late Saturday from the planned buffer, according to the Britain-based monitor, appeared to indicate the first part of the deal was not fully implemented either. “The jihadists not withdrawing gives the regime and Russia an excuse to carry out a military operation at least within the demilitarised zone,” Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said. HTS had likely “tried to gain time by neither explicitly refusing nor accepting the deal” between Russia and Turkey, he said. Sam Heller, an analyst at the International Crisis Group, on Twitter said the HTS announcement appeared to be a “tacit agreement of the Sochi deal”. “HTS emphasizes its responsibility and flexibility (within limits), which seemingly adds up to a tacit acceptance of the Sochi deal,” he wrote. Late Saturday, “heavy mortar shells” were fired from the planned buffer area into regime territory, killing two soldiers, the Observatory said. Rebels and jihadists had reportedly fulfilled the first part of the deal, with Turkish officials, armed factions and the Observatory reporting that the area was free of heavy-duty weaponry. But the shells which Saturday hit an army position in Hama province appear to have violated the accord. But it was unclear which groups fired the mortars late Saturday, it said, as both the Turkish-backed National Liberation Front and rival jihadist factions were present in the area. The NLF — which holds just under half of the Idlib region and has welcomed the accord — did not immediately respond to AFP’s request for comment on the shelling. The lion’s share of Idlib is held by HTS, as well as more hardline jihadists like Hurras al-Deen and Ansar al-Islam. Those fighters also control more than two-thirds of the planned buffer zone and are supposed to withdraw by this morning. Hurras al-Deen has publicly rejected the agreement, although it apparently withdrew its heavy arms from the area last week. HTS, widely considered the most powerful force in Idlib, had quietly abided by the deal’s first deadline and re-stationed heavy arms elsewhere. But getting them to agree to the second part of the deal has proven more difficult. In a recent report for the Turkey-based Omran Center, expert Nawar Oliver described HTS’s approval as the deal’s ultimate “test”. “If HTS acts as a spoiler to the agreement on the ground, this will probably lead to one of two scenarios: either Turkey and the NLF launch military action against HTS, or Russia will seize the opportunity with the support of the regime and its allies to enter Idlib,” he said. “The ramifications of that move could be vast,” he added. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and other top government officials have warned that the Idlib deal was only a “temporary” measure. On Friday, residents around Idlib received warning messages on their mobile phones from the Syrian army. “Get away from the fighters. Their fate is sealed and near,” one said."
"Jihadist group rejects deal for Syria’s Idlib, main faction yet to declare stance","BEIRUT (Reuters) – A jihadist faction in the Idlib region of northwestern Syria has rejected a Turkish-Russian deal that requires “radical” insurgents to withdraw from a demilitarized zone, and urged rebels to launch new military operations. While the Huras al-Din faction is not the main Islamist militant group in Idlib, its statement points to objections that may complicate the implementation of the agreement clinched last week by Russia and Turkey. The most powerful jihadist group in the northwest, Tahrir al-Sham, has yet to declare its stance on the deal, under which insurgents must vacate the demilitarized zone by Oct. 15. Tahrir al-Sham is a coalition of Islamist groups dominated by the faction formerly known as the Nusra Front, which was an official wing of the al Qaeda network until 2016. Tahrir al-Sham’s position will be critical. An alliance of Turkey-allied rebel groups, the National Front for Liberation, has declared its “complete cooperation” with the Turkish effort, but has also ruled out disarming or yielding territory. The Huras al-Din group was formed earlier this year by combatants who split from Tahrir al-Sham and the Nusra Front when it cut its ties with al Qaeda. It includes foreign militants. The group declared the agreement part of a plan “to eliminate the jihadist project” in the Levant. “We advise our mujahideen brothers in this decisive and dangerous phase … (to) begin military operations against the enemies of religion to thwart their plans,” it said in a statement released on Saturday. The demilitarized zone agreed by Turkey and Russia will be 15 to 20 km (10 to 12 miles) deep and run along the contact line between rebel and government fighters. It will be patrolled by Turkish and Russian forces. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that all opposition heavy weapons, mortars, tanks and rocket systems are to be removed from the zone by Oct. 10. Close to 3 million people live in Idlib, around half of them Syrians displaced by the war from other parts of Syria, and the United Nations has warned that an offensive would cause a humanitarian catastrophe."
"Syrian rebels see Idlib deal as victory, Damascus as test for Turkey"," AMMAN/BEIRUT (Reuters) – Syrian opposition officials praised a deal between Russia and Turkey over Idlib province on Tuesday, saying it had spared the rebel-held region a bloody government offensive and would thwart President Bashar al-Assad’s aim of recovering all Syria. Damascus, while welcoming the agreement unveiled on Monday, vowed to press on with its campaign to recover “every inch” of the country. Its ambassador to Lebanon said the deal would test Turkey’s ability to deliver on promises to disarm rebels. Russian President Vladimir Putin, Assad’s most powerful ally, and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan agreed at a summit on Monday to create a demilitarized zone in Idlib from which “radical” rebels must withdraw by the middle of next month. The agreement has diminished the prospects of a Syrian government offensive which the United Nations warned would create a humanitarian catastrophe in the Idlib region, home to about three million people. The Idlib region and adjoining territory north of Aleppo represents the Syrian opposition’s last big foothold in Syria, where Iranian and Russian military support has helped Assad recover most of the areas once held by the insurgency. But strong Turkish opposition to an Idlib attack has obstructed government plans for an offensive, and the agreement announced on Monday appears to preserve a role for Turkey in the northwest – something seen as anathema to Assad. “The Idlib deal preserves lives of civilians and their direct targeting by the regime. It buries Assad’s dreams of imposing his full control over Syria,” Mustafa Sejari, a Free Syria Army (FSA) official, told Reuters. “This area will remain in the hands of the Free Syrian Army and will force the regime and its supporters to start a serious political process that leads to a real transition that ends Assad’s rule,” Sejari said. The spokesman for the opposition Syrian Negotiations Commission said the deal had halted an offensive for which government forces had been mobilizing in recent weeks, calling it a “victory for the will for life over the will for death”. The “scenario of attack is practically excluded, at least for a period of time that is not small, and we hope that it will be permanent,” Yahya al-Aridi told Reuters by telephone. Syria’s ambassador to Lebanon, in an interview with Lebanon’s al-Jadeed TV, reiterated his government’s distrust of Turkey, a major backer of the Syrian rebellion which has deployed troops across the opposition-held northwest. “I see it as a test of the extent of Turkey’s ability to commit to implementing this decision. They are under pressure now and I believe they will try,” Ali Abdul Karim said. “We do not trust Turkey … but it’s useful for Turkey to be able to carry out this fight to rid these groups from their weapons…Turkey could deal with this responsibility and this would be useful,” he said. The demilitarized zone will be monitored by Russian and Turkish forces, the leaders said on Monday. Neither Putin not Erdogan explained how they planned to differentiate “radically-minded” rebels from other anti-Assad groups. It was also not immediately clear how much of the city of Idlib fell within the zone. Putin said the decision was to establish by Oct. 15 a demilitarized area 15–20 km (10-12 miles) deep along the contact line between rebel and government fighters, with radical militants to be withdrawn from the area, including members of the Nusra Front, a jihadist group that now part of the Tahrir al-Sham organization. Al-Watan, a pro-Syrian government newspaper, said on Tuesday the zone would stretch for 15 km around Idlib city. It also said Syrian state institutions would return to Idlib by the end of the year in the final phase of the deal after insurgents hand over all of their heavy weapons and move away from civilian areas. Citing unidentified diplomatic sources in Moscow, it said any factions rejecting the agreement would be considered enemies “even of the Turkish army and will be classed as terrorists that must be fought”. Erdogan, who had feared another cross-border exodus of Syrian refugees to join the 3.5 million already in Turkey, said the deal would allow opposition supporters to stay where they were and avert a humanitarian crisis. Putin said that by Oct. 10, all opposition heavy weapons, mortars, tanks, rocket systems would be removed from the demilitarized zone, and said this was Erdogan’s suggestion. Earlier this month, Putin publicly rebuffed a proposal from Erdogan for a ceasefire when the two met along with Iran’s president for a summit in Tehran. Idlib is held by an array of rebels. The most powerful is Tahrir al-Sham, an amalgamation of Islamist groups dominated by the former Nusra Front – an al Qaeda affiliate until 2016. Other Islamists, and groups fighting as the Free Syrian Army banner, are now gathered with Turkish backing under the banner of the “National Front for Liberation”."
Germany holds suspected former bin Laden bodyguard pending deportation,"BERLIN: A Tunisian man suspected of being an Islamist radical who once served as Osama bin Laden's bodyguard is in detention in Germany pending deportation to Tunisia, a spokesman for the city of Bochum said on Tuesday. The case of Sami A. sparked outrage in April after German media reported he was receiving welfare benefits even though intelligence agencies had classified him as a potential threat. Police said on Monday that they had arrested Sami A. after being asked to do so by authorities in the western city of Bochum and he had offered no resistance. Peter van Dyk, a spokesman for the city of Bochum, said on Tuesday that Sami A. had appeared before a judge on Monday who had decided the suspect should be placed in detention pending deportation. Van Dyk said the city of Bochum had on Monday received a notification from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) saying that they no longer considered there to be obstacles to his deportation. German authorities have been trying to deport the man, who has lived in the northwestern city of Bochum since 1997, since 2006 but the threat of torture in his home country had prevented this, according to a previous report in Bild. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has ordered immigration authorities to expedite proceedings that would allow Germany to deport Sami A. Bin Laden was a founder and leader of the militant Islamist movement al-Qaeda which carried out many attacks on U.S. and other Western targets including the September 11 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York. He was shot dead in May 2011 in Pakistan in an operation by U.S. special forces."
"Indonesia church attacker wanted to join IS in Syria, cops say"," JAKARTA, Feb 12 — The Indonesian who attacked a church congregation with a sword during Sunday Mass is a radical Islamist who had wanted to fight with the Islamic State group in Syria, police said today. Around 100 people were attending the service at a Catholic church in Yogyakarta province on Java island when Suliyono, 23, barged in wielding a one-metre-long sword and began attacking terror-stricken people, seemingly indiscriminately. Four people, including 81-year-old German-born priest Edmund Prier who was standing at the altar, were seriously injured. The extremist, who was later shot in the leg after ignoring a police warning shot, also decapitated a Virgin Mary statue with his sword. “Suliyono had made a passport application as he attempted to go to Syria, but the application failed. He ended up launching the attack here,” said national police chief Tito Karnavian. He said police are still investigating whether Suliyono was a “lone wolf terrorist” or part of a group. Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-populated country, is also home to significant numbers of Christians, Hindus and Buddhists but there are concerns over rising intolerance. Extremists have mounted a series of attacks against Christians and other minorities. In 2016 several children were injured after a man threw Molotov cocktails at a church during a Sunday service. On 2000 Christmas Eve, the al-Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah group staged coordinated bombings of churches in Jakarta and eight other cities which killed 18 people and injured many more. "

On 2000 Christmas Eve, the Al-Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah group staged coordinated bombings of churches in Jakarta and eight other cities which killed 18 people and injured many more."
The root causes of terrorism — Paneir Selvam,"Recently IGP Tan Sri Mohamed Fuzi Harun stated that seven terrorists were arrested in Sabah and all of them are members of the Abu Sayyaf group (ASG) which vigorously involved in kidnapping for ransom. One of the terrorists is known to have decapitation the hostages. In addition, Sabah CPO Datuk Omar Mammah also pointed out that the members of ASG trying to hide in Sabah and in meantime other terrorist groups also pose security threat by using Sabah as a hiding place. The statements made by both the IGP and CPO indicated that terrorist groups like ASG, Al Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and ISIS already have support base in this country. Additionally, a research firm has identified that an emergent number of Malaysians are supporting and be tolerance for terrorist activities in the name of religion. How these terrorist groups are able to penetrate and influence the locals in this country? Do the supporters and sympathisers of these groups are willing to risk their safety and freedom by providing safe houses for these terrorists? What had motivated them to support these terrorists whose intention to destroy this nation? Who has instigated them to act against Malaysia? What are the root causes which have influenced them to act in such a manner? A few days ago, shortly after the Asean-US Summit, US Vice President Mike Pence agreed with Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s narrative on terrorism that the root causes of terrorism need to be identified and resolved which will eliminate the threats posed by the terrorist groups globally. Last September at the 73rd UN general Assembly, Dr Mahathir had stressed that terrorism could be resolved if the international community especially the West recognise Palestine as a sovereign state and preventing the Israel regime from murdering Palestinians. By recognising Jerusalem as a capital of Israel by US President Donald Trump and its allies worsen the current efforts done by the international community to resolve this issue amiably. Apart from that the fulfillments of the key agreements according to the Oslo Accords by the Israel and Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) will be a paramount solution by recognising an independent state of Palestine and right of the Palestinians to self-determination which were in accordance with the UN’s Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. Most of the Salafi Jihadism based terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda, ISIS, JI, Boko Haram, Hizbul Mujahideen, Al-Ashtar Brigades (AAB), Jama’at Nusrat al_Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) and other similar groups are depicting the issue of Palestine as their main propaganda tool to recruit the potential terrorists. These so-called terrorists are sympathising with the suffering of Palestinians initially and later with the indoctrination of hate preachers they become hardcore terrorists. An Australian newspaper, Herald Sun recently reported that Amir Milson, a model once voted as the Malaysia’s Bachelor of the year was killed in Syria after he joined ISIS. As a young ordinary man who has world at his feet, Amir has died as a jihadist. Where was he radicalised? Who were his acquaintances before he was radicalised? Did he attend a particular madrassah/surau/mosque? What has make him to transform himself as a jihadist? Did he attend any hate preaches’ sermons or talks? I suspect Amir was brainwashed in the name of religion by his handlers who are posed as genuine religious teachers and preachers. These handlers/terrorists are disguised themselves as teachers and preachers. But actually they are hate preachers who willing destroy a nation to espouse their ideology. They can be a serious threat to our national security if we as Malaysians are unwilling to recognise and ignore them because of the sensitivity. For hate preachers the rule of law is dubious and extraneous. They are indoctrinated with false ideology which was misinterpreted from religious text. The current security dilemma confront by Malaysia is very much similar with the situation in United Kingdom now. Before the London bombing in 2005, the UK security forces through their network of intelligence received some information regarding with terrorist threats but failed to take the warning seriously. The perception is changed utterly after the bombings in London. Later the investigation reports have indicated that the terrorists who are involved with such attacks have been indoctrinated the ideology of Salafism by the hate preachers. These hate preachers who are wanted by Jordan and Egypt were given political asylum by UK and later they become the ideological masters for the present and future home grown terrorists in UK. The contemporary paradigm of global terrorist attacks is well linked with the hate preachers. The recent London and Manchester attacks are connected with the hate preachers in UK. The role of the hate preachers is to instigate their supporters and followers especially the young people and the converts to get involved with terrorist related activities. Generally, these hate preachers disguised themselves as the innocent or genuine preachers but their motives will be unknown to their acquaintances. These preachers will filter and choose the listeners or followers by picking up the people who have committed a lot of “sins.” They will not always have involved with attacks directly but rather as the inspirational figures to motivate and urge terrorists to commit the act. The current UK security debacle is started many years ago. The influx of foreign radical hate preachers who are allowed to stay and continue their “noble” activities in UK is the primary cause of the current problem. The people who sanctioned these hate preachers to be in UK probably never anticipated such atrocities which took placed in London or in Manchester. Most of them are policymakers who have no knowledge on security matters. In addition, they decide such delicate matters on the basis of human rights which is wrong approach to take on. These radical hate preachers can destroy a nation with help of people within. Omar Bakri Muhammad and Mustafa Kamel Mustafa also known as Abu Hamza had been convicted for radicalising British born young persons and the new converts. Further, they play a crucial role to groom another local radical hate preacher, Anjem Choudary who is a former solicitor to continue their cause in UK. Further, with the help of Omar, Anjem founded al-Muhajiroun. This organization was banned under the UK Terrorism Act 2000 because of its terrorist related activities. The Woolwich attacker Michael Adebolajo and Khuram Butt, the London Bridge terrorist, are associated with al-Muhajiroun. All the current attacks that happened in UK directly or indirectly are connected to these hate preachers. Therefore, another such attack is imminent in UK. In addition, they have created sleeper cells throughout UK and these cells will be operated as a factory which will produce British born terrorists. Even though in past, the UK security forces arrested and prosecuted successfully these terrorists but the attacks still occurred because of the influence of people like Omar, Abu Hamza and Anjem in UK. Malaysia is not far from the UK’s security situation. The Malaysia security and intelligence forces have captured the suspected terrorists of ISIS, Al Qaeda and JI. But in my opinion, the real threat pose by hate preachers and their supporters/sympathisers will be noxious. That’s because their appearance and conduct will encourage ordinary people to donate and much easier for them to recruit the potential terrorists. Further the self-radicalised terrorists who are influenced by the hate radical preachers in Malaysia can create an austere security threat in near future. The present security dilemma in Malaysia is very much similar to the current situation in UK. Even though this possibility is discounted now but the potential is still there. In addition, the change of government can be used by these hate preachers to instigate Malaysians in the name of religion by creating a hostile environment to conduct future terrorist attacks. Since 1960s many radical groups like the Tentera Sabilullah (Holy War Army), the Golongan Rohaniah (Spiritual Group), the Koperasi Angkatan Revolusi Islam Malaysia (Malaysian Islamic Revolutionary Front-KARIM), the Kumpulan Crypto (Crypto Group), the Kumpulan Mohd Nasir Ismail (Mohd Nasir Ismail Group), the Kumpulan Revolusi Islam Ibrahim Libya (Ibrahim Libya Islamic Revolution Group), the Kumpulan Jundullah (Jundullah Group), the Kumpulan Mujahidin Kedah (Kedah Mujahidin Group), the Kumpulan Perjuangan Islam Perak (Perak Islamic Movement Group-KPIP), the Kumpulan Persaudaraan Ilmu dalam Al-Maunah (Brotherhood of AlMa’unah Inner Power), the Kumpulan Militan Malaysia (KMM) and the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) were activated in Malaysia. Most of these groups were successfully crippled by the PDRM. Except for JI, the other groups lost their influence and support in Malaysia. All of these groups either started or inspired by the teaching of radical religious teachers and hate preachers. The general goal of these militant groups is to create pure Islamic state and overthrow the government at the time. JI is the most important terrorist organization in South-east Asia. This group is originated from Indonesia and started by two radical religious clerics, i.e. Abdullah Sungkar and Abu Bakar Ba’asyir. In 1980s both of them migrated to Malaysia because of the harsh treatment of Suharto regime. They started off in Banting and later expanded their set-up to Kuala Pilah and Ulu Tiram. They conducted religious classes based on Salafi Jihadism ideology to establish Daulah Islamiyyah comprising of Malaysia, Indonesia, Southern Philippines, Singapore and Brunei. The most infamous Malaysians from this group are Yazid Sufaat, Dr Azhari Hussin and Nordin Mohd Top. The first two terrorists are graduated from USA universities. Their transformation from western educated graduates to hardcore terrorists had perplexed many Malaysians. Dr Azhari and Nordin Mohd Top heavily involved with terrorist activities in Indonesia like Bali Bombing in 2002. At one point of time both of them become the most wanted terrorists in South-east Asia. After JI was incapacitated, ISIS become the most dangerous terrorist group in Malaysia. Zid Saharani Mohd, Lothfi Ariffin, Mohd Rafi Udin, Zainuri Kamaruddin and Muhammad Wanndy Mohamed Jedi were the important members of ISIS from Malaysia. All of them are believed to be killed in Syria and Iraq while they are engaging with terrorist activities. Many of these terrorists are from KMM then to JI and finally ended up as the members of ISIS. Therefore, the role played by radical religious teachers and hate preachers to transform them as the hardcore terrorists need to take a serious notice by the intelligence and security forces in Malaysia. The hate preachers are the source of inspiration to the terrorists globally because they are charismatic. They also have the capability to influence, manipulate and instigate the potential terrorists to launch the attacks by using false interpretations of the religion verses for their own benefit. To eliminate the threat of these hate preachers, the root causes of terrorism need to be resolved. The Palestine issue need be settled perpetually. That’s because all the hate preachers are using this issue to get support from the general public and some members of public later become supporters/sympathisers/terrorists. In conclusion, terrorism is not limited only to Muslims. In other faith believers’ terrorism do exist. It is not the fault of the religion or its believers. It is culpability of a small group of people who had misinterpreted the religious texts to gain power and fame. They called themselves as teachers, clerics and preachers. They are egocentric people. They don’t believe in peace and harmony. They subscribed false ideology based on the misguided interpretations of the religious texts and brainwashed others to commit terrorist acts in the name of the religion. In most cases, they themselves will not sacrificed for the cause but rather encourage others especially their students and supporters to do so. Therefore, the security and intelligence agencies in Malaysia have a huge task ahead. They need to work relentlessly to counter any terrorist attacks in Malaysia. Further they also have to identify, monitor and deter these hate preachers from any gains or any stimulus within the Malaysian society. In addition, the government through its religious agencies need to monitor the activities of these preachers and if they pose any threat to the national unity and security then they need to be reprimanded. * R.

Financier of Islamic State paid money to rebel group in eastern Congo,"KINSHASA: An Islamist rebel group in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo received money from a financier linked to Islamic State, suggesting tentative ties between the Congo insurgents and other jihadists in Africa and beyond, a report said on Thursday. Islamist ""financial facilitator"" Waleed Ahmed Zein paid the Allied Democratic Forces at least once, said the report from New York University's Congo Research Group and the Bridgeway Foundation that cited U.S. sources and an ADF defector. Zein is on a U.S. government sanctions list and was arrested in his home country of Kenya in July for links to Islamic State. The payments were made in recent years but it was not clear when, how much was paid or how the money was used. The Congolese government blames the ADF for a series of massacres in the last two years in the east of the country where violence around the city of Beni has hobbled efforts to contain an Ebola outbreak. The ADF was set up by Ugandan Muslims in the 1990s purporting to fight for the rights of the Tablighi Jamaat sect, although it turned to banditry after crossing Uganda's western border with Congo. The Congolese and Ugandan governments accuse the ADF of links with jihadists like al Qaeda but has offered little evidence to back up these claims. The payment was made as the ADF seeks to align itself with Islamic State, Nigeria-based Boko Haram and al Qaeda and other groups. ""The ADF appear to be ... becoming more interested in broadcasting their messages to a wider ... audience and are attempting to present themselves within a broader setting of radical jihadi groups,"" the report said. Links between the ADF and other groups are not yet strong, it said. Reuters was unable to independently verify the findings of the report. To reach a wider audience, the ADF has made propaganda videos which feature a flag similar to Islamic State's and broadcast in Luganda, Arabic, French, Kinyarwanda and Swahili, the region's most widely spoken language. They call for martyrdom and violence against infidels, the report said. Rival militia groups control parts of eastern Congo, long after the official end of a 1998-2003 war in which millions of people died, mostly from hunger and disease. Rights groups say the army is responsible for at least some of the recent killings in eastern Congo."
Jordanian court sentences nine militants in Karak shooting,"A court in Jordan on Tuesday sentenced nine militants to prison terms ranging from three years to life for a shooting rampage two years ago in an ancient castle in the southern city of Karak that killed 10 people, including a Canadian tourist. AMMAN: A court in Jordan on Tuesday sentenced nine militants to prison terms ranging from three years to life for a shooting rampage two years ago in an ancient castle in the southern city of Karak that killed 10 people, including a Canadian tourist. The court said the group of nine were involved in helping Islamist militants in attacks on the area surrounding an ancient crusader castle. The gunfights also left four militants dead. The state security court found them guilty of ""abetting terrorist acts that led to the death of human beings"" and committing ""terrorist acts using automatic weapons"". Militants from al Qaeda and other radical jihadist groups have long targeted the U.S.-allied kingdom and dozens of militants are currently serving long prison terms. King Abdullah, an ally of the Western powers against Islamist militancy and a defender of Jordan’s peace treaty with Israel, has been among the most vocal leaders in the region in warning of threats posed by radical groups. Jordan plays a prominent role in the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, providing military, logistical and intelligence support, according to Western diplomats and regional intelligence sources. Jordan has been relatively unscathed by the uprisings, civil wars and Islamist militancy that have swept the Middle East since 2011, but it maintains a high level of vigilance."
"9/11 co-organiser released from German jail, to be deported to Morocco","HAMBURG, GERMANY (REUTERS) - Mounir El Motassadeq, a friend of the September 11 hijackers who was sentenced to 15 years in a German prison in 2007 for being an accessory to mass murder, was deported to his native Morocco on Monday (Oct 15). One of only two men ever convicted in relation to the militant attacks of Sept 11, 2001 is being deported from his German prison, but it's unclear if this means freedom for him. El Motassadeq has served most of a 15-year sentence, the maximum sentence for being an accessory to mass murder. But German authorities have declined to say what happens to him next. It's thought he'll be taken to his native Morocco. But again, what would happen after hasn't been revealed. El Motassadeq was a member of a group radical Islamists in Hamburg who helped orchestrate the al Qaeda attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center. During his trial in 2007 his lawyers argued that he knew nothing of the plot. But prosecutors said at the time that he played a central role by handling the finances of several members."
"Jihadists fail to quit Syria buffer, throwing deal into doubt","Jihadists in Syria’s Idlib failed to meet a Monday deadline to leave a planned buffer zone ringing the country’s last rebel bastion, casting fresh doubt over a deal to avert bloodshed. A Russian-Turkish truce agreement reached nearly a month ago for the northwestern region gave “radical fighters” until October 15 to leave a proposed demilitarised area between government and opposition forces. The accord was a last-ditch effort to stave off a regime onslaught on Idlib, the largest rebel stronghold left in war-ravaged Syria and home to around three million people. But the target date for the withdrawal came and went without any hardliners leaving. “We did not document the withdrawal of any jihadist fighters from the entire demilitarised zone,” Rami Abdel Rahman, the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor, said on Monday morning. Jihadists had until midnight Sunday to Monday to pull out, according to Abdel Rahman and two rebel commanders in Idlib. Syria’s government said it would take “time” to judge if the deal had failed. “We have to wait for the Russian reaction. Russia is monitoring and following the situation,” Foreign Minister Walid Muallem told reporters in Damascus. He said he hoped Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan would still be able to “fulfil the agreement from his part”. Hours before the cut-off time, Idlib’s jihadist heavyweight Hayat Tahrir al-Sham vowed to continue fighting. “We have not abandoned our choice of jihad and fighting towards implementing our blessed revolution,” said HTS, an alliance led by Al-Qaeda’s one-time Syria branch. HTS and other, more extreme jihadists hold over two-thirds of the planned buffer area, and over half of the rest of Idlib. Their withdrawal was seen as the real test of the accord reached on September 17 between rebel backer Ankara and regime supporter Moscow in the Russian resort town of Sochi. The deal provides for a 15-20 kilometre buffer zone semi-circling opposition-held areas in Idlib and the neighbouring provinces of Latakia, Hama, and Aleppo. It set a first deadline of October 10 for all rebels and jihadists to pull heavy weapons from the zone, a task which Turkey, the Observatory, and rebels said was done on time. But late Saturday, mortar rounds fired from the buffer hit regime positions and killed two soldiers, the Observatory said, indicating heavy arms may still be in the zone. The apparent violation came just ahead of the deal’s second and more consequential deadline: a full jihadist withdrawal of the zone by Monday, paving the way for Russia and Turkey to monitor the area. HTS has yet to take a formal stance on the Sochi accord and its most recent statement made no mention of the deadline. But it and other jihadists appeared to have quietly pulled out their heavy arms in line with the first deadline on October 10. That, observers said, could indicate that hope was not yet lost for the buffer. “Even if the agreement is not fully implemented today, it doesn’t mean that it’s not holding,” said Haid Haid, research fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation. HTS would seek the “best possible scenario” for its own survival, but that may include “a partial withdrawal”. Better late than never? Sam Heller, an International Crisis Group analyst, said the ambiguity in HTS’s statement “could be seen as a sort of implicit acceptance of the Sochi deal and its implementation”. The onus was now on Ankara and Moscow — the deal’s two sponsors and the chief powerbrokers of the Syrian war — to overcome the missed deadline. “October 15 is a test of Turkey’s ability to implement the deal, but at the same time it’s a test of Russia’s intentions and how serious it is about continuing the agreement,” Heller told AFP. It would show whether Moscow was committed to keeping the deal alive or “implementing it to the letter,” he said. Last week, Russia hinted that it could accept a brief delay if it meant the spirit of the deal was still upheld. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the buffer should be fully operational by October 15, but that a delay of one or two days would “make no difference.” Syria’s top diplomat Muallem said earlier this month that the deal may take until December to execute. But he hinted on Monday that the military option was not off the table, saying jihadists should be removed from Idlib. “We have to wait, but at the same time, our troops are still ready around Idlib,” he said. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has said the Idlib is only “temporary,” and that the area would eventually fall back to government hands."
Rebels fire shells from Syria buffer despite heavy arms pullout,"BEIRUT (AFP) - Opposition fighters have fired mortar shells from a planned buffer zone in northwest Syria, in a deadly attack that threatens a deal to protect the last major rebel bastion from a regime offensive. The Russian-Turkish accord also provides for militants to withdraw by Monday (Oct 15) from the demilitarised zone ringing rebel-held areas in and around Idlib province. But a monitor and Agence France-Presse (AFP) correspondent said on Sunday no hardliners had been seen leaving the region yet. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor reported ""heavy mortar shells"" were fired late on Saturday from the planned buffer area into regime territory, killing two soldiers. The deal agreed last month is only the latest in a string of truces throughout Syria's seven-year war, which has killed more than 360,000 people and displaced millions. It calls for setting up a horseshoe-shaped buffer zone around the Idlib region that would be free of heavy arms by Oct 10 and of ""radical fighters"" by Oct 15. Rebels and militants had reportedly met the first deadline, with Turkish officials, armed factions and the Britain-based Observatory reporting that the area was free of heavy-duty weaponry. But the shells which on Saturday hit an army position in Hama province appear to have violated the accord. ""This is the first clear violation of the deal since the heavy weapons were withdrawn. This area is supposed to be clear of heavy weapons, including mortar shells,"" said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. He said intermittent regime shelling had been hitting the planned buffer for days, but the deal does not require government forces to withdraw any of their weapons. Syrian pro-regime daily Al-Watan also reported rebel shelling, saying on Sunday that western parts of Aleppo province were being hit with ""rocket fire and shelling with heavy weapons, which were supposed to be pulled out from the area"". And an AFP correspondent in western Aleppo reported mortar fire in the area after several days of quiet. The Observatory said it was not clear which groups fired the mortars, as both the Turkish-backed National Liberation Front (NLF) and rival militant factions were present in the area. The NLF - which holds just under half of the Idlib region and has welcomed the accord - did not immediately respond to AFP's request for comment on the shelling. The lion's share of Idlib is held by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an alliance led by former Al-Qaeda members, as well as more hardline militants like Hurras al-Deen and Ansar al-Islam. Those fighters also control more than two-thirds of the planned buffer zone and are supposed to withdraw by Monday. But that deadline appeared increasingly precarious on Sunday, with no hardliners visibly leaving the zone as the clock winds down. The Observatory said it had not monitored any withdrawals, and an AFP correspondent in Idlib also said no militant factions had moved any of their units in recent days. Hurras al-Deen has publicly rejected the agreement, although it apparently withdrew its heavy arms from the area last week. HTS, widely considered the most powerful force in Idlib, has not publicly commented on the accord but also quietly abided by its first deadline and re-stationed heavy arms elsewhere. Persuading these factions to implement the deal's second half would be much more challenging, observers say. In a recent report for the Turkey-based Omran Center, expert Nawar Oliver described HTS's approval as the deal's ultimate ""test"". ""If HTS acts as a spoiler to the agreement on the ground, this will probably lead to one of two scenarios: either Turkey and the NLF launch military action against HTS, or Russia will seize the opportunity with the support of the regime and its allies to enter Idlib,"" he said. ""The ramifications of that move could be vast,"" he added. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and other top government officials have warned that the Idlib deal was only a ""temporary"" measure. On Friday, residents around Idlib received warning messages on their mobile phones from the Syrian army. ""Get away from the fighters. Their fate is sealed and near,"" one said."
 Alleged Abu Sayyaf member nabbed in Zamboanga City,A suspected member of the Abu Sayyaf Group was arrested Thursday afternoon in Zamboanga City. Police said an informant tipped them on the presence of the suspect who went to the Hall of Justice to get a clearance. Daud is facing charges of kidnapping and serious illegal detention with ransom. A warrant for his arrest was issued by the Zamboanga City Regional Trial Court Branch 16 in June 2004. He is one of the suspects in the kidnapping of a businessman in Barangay Pasonanca in January 2004. Daud was brought to Zamboanga City Police Station 11 for proper documentation.
"Abu Sayyaf bandit dead, 20 soldiers wounded in Sulu clash","An Abu Sayyaf bandit was killed while 20 soldiers were wounded in a clash in Patikul town, Sulu, Thursday morning. According to the Western Mindanao Command, troops from the Philippine Army's 41st Infantry Battalion encountered more than 40 armed members of the Abu Sayyaf group in the village of Langhub. The gun battle lasted for a few minutes leaving one bandit, identified as Alpata Abdurasa, dead. Some 20 soldiers were wounded, mostly sustaining shrapnel wounds from an M203 grenade launcher and two sustaining gunshot wounds. The military said it believes there could be more casualties on the side of the terrorist group, as blood stains were spotted in the encounter site. The wounded soldiers were immediately brought to the Camp Teodulfo Bautista Station Hospital for medical attention."
 3 Abu Sayyaf members slain in Sulu clash," MANILA - Three members of the bandit Abu Sayyaf Group were killed in an encounter with government troops in Indanan town, Sulu, military officials said Thursday.

Report: Residents of Cheras flats unaware Abu Sayyaf leader was their neighbour," KUALA LUMPUR, July 8 — Residents of Desa Baiduri flats in Cheras had no knowledge that a leader from the Abu Sayyaf group was quietly living among them for two years, up until his arrest in August last year. Hajar Abdul Mubin, also known as Abu Asrie, had apparently been living in Kuala Lumpur with other relatives and friends from the same Yakan ethnic group, mainly found in Basilan, Philippines. In an exclusive Sunday Star report, neighbours testified that they did not think much of the Yakans residing in the flats, including Hajar who is the nephew of another Abu Sayyaf leader called Furuji Indama. Housewife Nurul Shuhada, 26, who lived in the unit opposite Hajar’s, remembered seeing many people regularly going in and out of the flat, adding that she merely thought they were unemployed. “They liked to chat. When I made kerepek (crisps) outside, they liked to talk with me and asked me where my kuih (cakes) were going and things like that. “I was surprised when I heard that those people were with the Abu Sayyaf because they were friendly to their neighbours,” she told the Sunday edition of the English daily. A retired air force man Zulkifli Abu Talib, 57, said the Yakan community in the Desa Baiduri flats tended to stick together. “We just thought they were Sabahan. Their language isn’t Bahasa Malaysia; they spoke their own language among themselves,” he said. Before Hajar’s arrest, Zulkifli’s son had been involved in a scuffle with a group of Yakan, which later turned violent enough to prompt police intervention but it was settled with no report lodged. “Just two weeks later, the police came. Then I found out that they were with the Abu Sayyaf. All of us here were scared. We were shocked,” Zulkifli said On Tuesday, the High Court sentenced Abu Asrie to six years’ jail for supporting the Abu Sayyaf by becoming a member of the group at a house in Lorong Pangsa Baiduri 2, Taman Desa Baiduri in Cheras from 2010 to August 30 last year. Hajar’s brother-in-law Abdul Syamir Dabilin, 25, was also sentenced to three years for intentionally omitting information on a terrorist act at the same time and place. Meanwhile, Hajar’s sister, who wished to be known as Rosmawati, told Sunday Star that her brother wanted to turn over a new leaf and build a new life for himself in Kuala Lumpur. “If you leave the Abu Sayyaf group, they will kill you,” she said. “So he made the choice. If he stayed in the Philippines and they found him, they would kill him. So he escaped here.” According to the 22-year-old, Hajar was married two years ago and now has a five-month-old daughter. She added Hajar was a quiet man who rarely went out with friends and preferred to stay at home, reading the Quran and praying. During his time with the Abu Sayyaf in Basilan, Hajar is believed to have been involved in the kidnapping of six Philippine nationals and may have even taken part in beheading one of them."
2 more Abu Sayyaf surrender in Basilan,"ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines — Two more members of the Abu Sayyaf surrendered to the government Sunday in a remote village of Basilan after learning how their former comrades are being reintegrated into society, authorities said Monday. Superintendent Rufino Inot, Basilan police director, said Abu Sayyaf members Jamad Habil Habing, 22, and his younger brother Jem, 20, also surrendered their weapon, including an M16 rifle with an M203 grenade launcher, four magazines loaded with ammunition, four rounds of M203 ammunition and a bandolier. Inot said the Habing siblings, who were followers of notorious Abu Sayyaf leader Furuji Indama, surrendered to the Basilan police Sunday at Barangay Baguindan, Tipo-Tipo town. The police said the two Abu Sayyaf members told them they no longer believe their leaders' warnings that the authorities would kill them if they surrender. The two surrenderees also reportedly told police that they had heard about how the lives of other Abu Sayyaf who surrendered earlier had already improved. Habing said other Abu Sayyaf are considering surrendering because they are tired from hiding and starving in the mountains. The surrender of the Habings brings to 180 the number of Abu Sayyaf group members — including Nurhassan Jamiri, a senior leader — who have surrendered to the government. Police and military estimated about less than 40 Abu Sayyaf members are still hiding with Indama in the Sampinit, a mountain complex in the center of Basilan Island. Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao Regional Governor Mujiv Hataman said positive developments continue for Abu Sayyaf members who surrendered ahead. ""Some of those are just trying to find the timing to escape from the tyranny of their leaders, because they see that the improvements in the lives of those who surrendered ahead of them,"" he said. He said the Basilan provincial government and security forces are helping implement assistance and livelihood training, as well as community integration, for the surrenderees. ""These efforts really enticed more Abu Sayyaf members to stream down into the community,"" Hataman said. He said the efforts are part of the Program Against Violent Extremism to assist those who were misled into terrorism or who were forced to join the Abu Sayyaf group. "
Abu Sayyaf member wanted for mass abduction nabbed in Zambo,"ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines — Police and its intelligence unit arrested an Abu Sayyaf member, who went into hiding for his involvement in a mass abduction and siege in Lamitan City, during a law enforcement operation Thursday in a coastal village east of this city, official said. The captured suspect was identified as Wahab Sahirin Salapuddin, alias Abu Damdam, said to be a member of the Abu Sayyaf group based in Basilan, said Chief Superintendent Billy Beltran, director of Police Regional Office 9 (PRO). Beltran said the local police from Station 3 backed by the intelligence unit nabbed Salapuddin about 5:45 p.m. after being tracked in the vicinity of Barangay Sangali. The police official said Salapuddin has a standing warrant of arrest for seven counts of kidnapping and serious illegal detention which stemmed from the mass abduction of plantation workers of Golden Harvest Plantation at Barangay Tairan, Lantawan town, Basilan on June 11, 2001. The police and military were also looking at Salapuddin’s participation in the siege of Lamitan City church and hospital on June 2 on the same year. Beltran said the arrested militant was detained at the police station in Sangali while waiting for proper disposition to the court. The arrest of Salapuddin brought the number of arrested Abu Sayyaf member to 25, Beltran added. "
Sulu mayor's 2 relatives rescued from Abu Sayyaf - military,"MANILA - Authorities have rescued the half-sister and stepmother of Talipao, Sulu Mayor Nivocadnezar Tulawie from their suspected Abu Sayyaf abductors, the military said Thursday. Liutenant Colonel Gerry Besana, spokesperson of Western Mindanao, confirmed to ABS-CBN News that Tulawie's relatives were rescued late Wednesday, but did not provide additional details on the incident. An ABS-CBN source, however, claimed the bandits released the victims in the boundary of Patikul and Talipao towns. A village chief supposedly fetched the victims there before handing them over to another barangay chairman of Talipao, the source said.

Senior Abu Sayyaf member arrested in Jolo for kidnapping,"COTABATO CITY, Philippines — Agents arrested on Saturday night in Jolo, Sulu a senior member of the Islamic State-inspired Abu Sayyaf wanted for kidnapping and other heinous offenses. Chief Superintendent Graciano Mijares of the Police Regional Office-Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao said Sunday Hashim Abtain, most known in Sulu province as Abu Imam, is now detained, awaiting prosecution. Mijares said police units in Sulu were assisted by the Police Regional Office-9 in Zamboanga City in the operation that led to Abtain's arrest. Abtain reportedly enjoyed the protection of certain powerful politicians in Sulu, enabling him to move around in the island province freely. Sulu, a component area of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, is said to be the most dangerous province in the country and a bastion of the Abu Sayyaf. ""God-fearing vigilant people in the local communities helped the police locate him in Jolo on Saturday night,"" Mijares said. Abtain did not resist arrest when personnel of the Sulu provincial police and PRO-9, backed by soldiers, cornered and immediately cuffed him while inside a house along Serrantes Street in Jolo, capital town of Sulu.

"One soldier killed, 10 others wounded in encounter with 60 Abu Sayyaf terrorists in Sulu","A government soldier was killed while 10 others were wounded following an encounter with some 60 members of the terrorist Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) in Patikul, Sulu, on Tuesday, the military disclosed on Thursday. Brigadier General Divino Rey Pabayo, commander of the Joint Task Force Sulu, said operating troops of the Army’s 32nd Infantry Battalion led by Lieutenant Colonel Ronaldo Mateo encountered 60 Abu Sayyaf Group members at Sitio Kan Apo Aluk, Barangay Panglayahan, Patikul, Sulu at 1:55 p.m..

It was learned that the troops were scouring the area when they engaged the Abu Sayyaf in a firefight that lasted for two hours. This resulted in the death of a soldier and wounding of 10 others. Casualties on the enemy side is yet to be determined. “We believe that a number of bandits were wounded and probably could have died due to loss of blood after Tuesday’s encounter,” Pabayo said. “Reinforcements were deployed to block the possible withdrawal of the enemy. Troops continue to scour the area,” he added. Lieutenant General Dela Vega, commander of the Western Mindanao Command, said the encounter against the Abu Sayyaf gives them more resolve to further intensify their operations against the bandits."

Abu Sayyaf bombs DPWH officials’ residences in Basilan,"Isabela City – Suspected members of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) detonated an Improvise Explosive Device (IED) outside the residence of the district engineer of the Department of Public Works and Highways-Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (DPWH-ARMM) in Basilan late Thursday night. Another IED  was recovered by  police and military authorities outside  the perimeter fence of DPWH-ARMM Basilan assistant district engineer. Police  and military authorities here said the explosion occurred at around 9:50 p.m. Thursday  at the perimeter fence of DPWH-ARMM District Engineer  Soler Undug’s house located at Calle Bisaya in this city, while the Undug family was  preparing to go to bed. The authorities here said another  IED, which failed to explode, was  also found by the police and military authorities outside the residence  of DPWH-ARMM Basilan assistant  district engineer Salonga ‘Bong’ Lasatan,  located in the village of Aguada, which is just a few meters away from the residence of  Undug. No one was hurt because of the twin explosions, but these caused mild panic among residents in the area. “(The police and military) know these people who are involved in extortion  and insurgency activities here. But still they cannot arrest them with the implementation of martial law in Mindanao,”  some residents living near the blast site said. A  government official in this province, who declined to be named, challenge police and military authorities here to go after these rogue elements. The police said a cellular phone was used as triggering device for the IEDs. Undug said footage from a close circuit television (CCTV) camera installed outside his residence showed four persons planting the IED. He said that a copy of the footage is now with the police and military. Undug said he has been receiving extortion text messages from the ASG, threatening him and his family with harm if they do not give in to their demand for protection money. Alarmed local residents said the police and military authorities should strengthen their security and intelligence network in order to avoid a similar incident from happening again. They called on the  police officials and Task Force Basilan commander  Col. Juvimax Uy to be more earnest in implementing martial law in Basilan Province."
Police arrest eight terror suspects," KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 16 — The police have arrested seven Filipinos and a Malaysian suspected to be involved in terrorism, including a Filipino who has beheaded captives of the Abu Sayyaf Group, it was disclosed today. Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi Harun said the suspects were arrested in raids conducted between October 30 and November 12 in Sabah and Putrajaya by the Special Branch Counter Terrorism Division. The Malaysian was the first to be arrested, in Putrajaya on October 30, he said in a statement, adding that the 38-year-old man had been an agent selling gold bullion. “The suspect was involved in channelling funds to Akel Zainal (a Malaysian who had joined the Daesh terrorists in Syria) in 2017 to finance terrorist activities,” he said. The second raid, on November 1 in Tenom, Sabah, resulted in the arrest of three Filipino suspects aged 27, 34 and 51 who worked as labourers, he said. “They are members of the Abu Sayyaf Group involved in kidnapping for ransom in the southern Philippines and Sabah,” Mohamad Fuzi said, adding that the 34-year-old suspect had the skills to produce firearms for the group’s use. On November 8, two more Filipinos, aged 35 and 46, were arrested in Ranau, Sabah, he said. One was a labourer and the other a technician. “The 35-year-old suspect had recruited children into the Abu Sayyaf Group and used them as human shields during the battles with the Philippine military in Basilan, southern Philippines. “He was also involved in beheading captives of the group. The two were caught before their planned escape to the southern Philippines to evade arrest by the Malaysian authorities,” he said. Mohamad Fuzi said the fourth raid, on November 10 in Kinarut, Sabah, resulted in the arrest of a 30-year-old Filipino blacksmith who is an Abu Sayyaf Group commander and right-hand man of Furuji Indama, a senior leader of the group."
"Abu Sayyaf terror group regrouping, looking to get back into business of kidnap-for-ransom","KOTA KINABALU (THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - The resurrection of a kidnap-for-ransom group in the southern Philippines after a 21-month hiatus is posing fresh threats to Sabah's east coast. Abu Sayyaf sub-commanders are regrouping after nearly two years on the run. One ""resurrected"" sub-commander is Indang Susukan, who was widely reported to have died when his wife and children were killed during a security forces' attack on his home base in Talipao, on Jolo island. He previously held several hostages who were abducted from the east coast of Sabah, including the Tung cousins from Negri Sembilan kidnapped in 2012, Taiwanese Chang An Wei (snatched from Pom Pom island in 2013) and Bernard Then, the first and only Malaysian to be beheaded by Abu Sayyaf. Indang is back on the radar of Philippine security forces as he is believed to be plotting a cross-border kidnapping. The sub-commander has recovered from gunshot injuries during the security forces' attack and kept a low profile. He has changed his looks by dyeing his long black hair blonde. He, however, continues to organise localised kidnappings in Jolo town with the Lucky 9 group. Indang, according to a regional intelligence source, is working with another Abu Sayyaf sub-commander, Hatib Sawadjan, who managed to stay out of sight during the crackdown on the Abu Sayyaf. The source said Indang and Hatib received financing from southern Philippine political warlords growing edgy over the newly introduced Bangsamoro Organic Law (also known as Bangsamoro Basic Law). The BOL creates a Muslim-majority sub-state in the Philippines that will replace the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao. The source explained that the warlords were setting their sights on ""high value"" victims. According to the source, the warlords - through Abu Sayyaf sub-commanders - have so far financed up to 1.7 million pesos (S$122,868.48) for two kidnap-for-ransom groups to carry out kidnappings in waters off the east coast of Sabah. The source said one of the groups, with at least eight gunmen led by Amah Ullah, aka Suraka, tried to target an oil palm-laden tugboat in Tambisan waters off Lahad Datu on Aug 10. But the group failed after Malaysian forces sped to the scene when they were alerted by the crew, who hid in the tugboat. The source said Suraka was backed by another group of seven under Salip Murah, who was waiting at the sea border. After the failed attempt, Philippine authorities tracked down Suraka to the Tawi-Tawi chain of islands in the southern Philippines and killed him a few days later, while several members of his eight-man gang were caught, the source added. Subsequently, Salip and his group fled towards the Philippines' Palawan island (north of Kudat), where they picked up two Filipino hostages and returned to Jolo. The source said Indang paid two other groups one million pesos to seek high-value targets in Sabah waters. On Sept 11, a group led by an Abu Sayyaf gunman named Titing used pump boats to sneak from Siluag island in the southern Philippines into Sabah waters by navigating through shallow shoals. Pump boats, often likened to sea scooters, are powered by water pumps and used as a cheaper mode of transport to move around shallow waters without any hassle, rather than using outboard engines. The source said for kidnap-for-ransom groups, travelling on a pump boat was much cheaper as it cost them about RM200 in fuel for a round trip from Jolo to Semporna. With speedboat engines, the fuel could cost over RM1,000. ""These pump boats are very agile, they can move through shallow waters and also seaweed farms without getting stuck like those with outboard engines,"" he said. In the latest case, the abductors snatched two Indonesian fishermen at gunpoint from a trawler anchored near Pulau Gaya, which is about a 30- to 40-minute boat ride from Semporna town. Mr Samsul Sagunim, 40, and Mr Usman Yunus, 35, were taken on a pump boat to Jolo, where they are said to be held by Indang in Patikul. ""The kidnappers thought that the hostages were Malaysians as the fishing trawler flew the Malaysian flag,"" said the source, adding that a Malaysian hostage could be worth a ransom of about RM1 million (S$329,893.87), whereas it was only about RM50,000 for an Indonesian boatman. Sabah Police Commissioner Datuk Omar Mammah told reporters on Tuesday that the captors were demanding RM4 million for the release of the fishermen. ""That's not surprising, because usually the initial ransom demand is outrageous as it is part of such groups' bargaining process,"" said the source. Before this, the last abduction in Sabah waters was on Dec 8, 2016, when the notorious Abraham @ Ibrahim went on a kidnapping spree. In his third bid that night, Abraham and two accomplices were killed by police in a gunfight off Pulau Gaya, in Semporna. Police rescued a victim, but two other kidnappers and a second victim are still missing at sea. According to the source, the second kidnap-for-ransom group, led by one self-styled ""Commander Black"", is lurking in the waters between eastern Sabah and the Tawi-Tawi chain of islands. ""Commander Black is an emerging kidnapper. He is aggressive and he will take on security forces if confronted,"" he said. The source said they were using ""spotters"" to give them information on potential targets. ""The Sept 11 kidnapping was a test run. It was successful and the kidnap-for-ransom group will use the same route - going through shallow waters - to go for a more audacious attempt along the shores of Semporna town,"" he said. However, Commander Black's plan might have hit a snag. Last Thursday night, in the waters off Kunak, Eastern Sabah Security Command (Esscom) shot dead two suspected kidnap-for-ransom group ""collaborators"" and recovered two revolvers, a samurai sword and a pump boat which were suspected to be used in the kidnapping of the two Indonesians. Esscom commander Deputy Comm Datuk Hazani Ghazali said they believed the two killed were key local links to the groups involved in the Sept 11 snatching of the two Indonesians off Pulau Gaya. ""I believe we have cut off their links, hopefully they will not have spotters to guide them into our waters,"" he said when contacted."
"Sayyaf kills five soldiers, hurts 23","Militants have killed five soldiers and wounded 23 others in a major ambush by members of a notorious Islamist kidnap-for-ransom group, military authorities said Saturday. The soldiers were searching for hostages taken by the Abu Sayyaf group when the gunmen attacked them in Jolo on Friday, regional military spokesman Lt. Col. Gerry Besana told reporters. Meanwhile, the Abu Sayyaf Group bandits have released a woman they kidnapped together with her husband almost two months ago in Zamboanga del Norte, police said Saturday.  In a statement, the Sulu Provincial Police Office said the victim, Helen Roda, was released around 2:30 p.m. Thursday in Barangay Anuling, Patikul, Sulu.  ASG sub-leaders Mujer Yadah and Injam Yadah released Roda following the alleged payment of a P1-million ransom, police said.  The ransom was reportedly delivered by two unidentified negotiators who, at the same time, accompanied Roda in her travel to Zamboanga City aboard a commercial ferry, police said.  Roda was released 29 days after the ASG bandits freed her husband, Rufo, a militiaman, on Oct. 18 following the alleged payment of P1.2 million in ransom.  They were seized on Aug. 31 by five ASG bandits following a firefight in Barangay Piacan, a coastal village in the town of Sirawai, Zamboanga del Norte.  Six people, including a militiaman, were killed while a child was wounded in the clash that broke out when the militiamen responded to the reported arrival of five gunmen clad in camouflage uniforms.  Roda’s release has brought down to six the number of hostages still in the hands of the ASG bandits. The hostages include a Dutch, a Vietnamese, and four Filipinos.  According to Besana, “The effort is part of our mission to rescue the remaining hostages.”  The Abu Sayyaf is a loose alliance of several hundred armed militants formed in the 1990s with seed money from Osama bin Laden’s Al-Qaeda network.Friday’s clash was one of the deadliest since an Abu Sayyaf faction joined other foreign and Filipino militants in seizing the southern Philippine city of Marawi last year, leading to a five-month battle that claimed more than 1,100 lives. The Abu Sayyaf is now believed to hold “less than 10” hostages, Besana said. The group is based in Mindanao but its members began in 2016 to kidnap sailors in the waters between Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The militants have also raided and taken hostages from resorts in the Mindanao and neighboring Malaysia. Most of the hostages have been ransomed off for huge amounts of money and several were beheaded, including two Canadian tourists in 2016.  A Dutch birdwatcher abducted on a nearby island in 2012 is believed to be among those still in Abu Sayyaf’s hands. The Dutchman’s Swiss colleague escaped in 2014 after grabbing a kidnapper’s machete and killing him. The soldiers who survived Friday’s ambush did not see any hostages during the 90-minute clash near the town of Patikul, Besana said. Besana added the soldiers from the Army’s 41st Infantry Battalion were on a combat patrol when they encountered the ASG bandits under Almuder Yadah and Sub-leader Hatib Hajan Sawadjaan, identified as two notorious ASG leaders. He said the fighting erupted in different stages, the first lasting for an hour. After a couple of minutes of a lull, gunfire rang anew, sparking a 30-minute battle."
Two Indonesian fishermen kidnapped off Semporna,"KOTA KINABALU, Sept 11 — Kidnappers here have struck again in Sabah’s east coast, this time abducting two Indonesian fishermen in Semporna’s Pulau Gaya early this morning. Sabah acting police chief Datuk Omar Mammah said three fishermen had just docked on Pulau Gaya at about 1am when they were approached by a pump boat and had their power cut off. “One of the men on the boat immediately hid in a compartment on the front of the boat but managed to see two men in masks and armed with M16s climb onboard and then heard them speak in Suluk,” he said to reporters this morning. The witness eventually came out from hiding about an hour later and his 40-year-old skipper and 35-year-old assistant were nowhere to be found. He later made a police report about his missing co-workers. ""We have taken a statement from the witness and are investigating the incident now,"" said Omar, adding that they were also checking to see whether the suspects belong to the Abu Sayyaf group. Sabah chief minister Datuk Seri Mohd Shafie Apdal said that he was informed of the incident and said the authorities will assist their Indonesian counterparts as best as they can. “I believe they have identified the fishermen who were kidnapped now. We will upgrade our surveillance and intelligence and find out where they are the best we can. “Even though they are not Malaysians, they were caught in our boundary so we must protect them,” he said. Sabah's 6pm to 6am sea curfew, first imposed four years ago, was extended to Sept 13 and covers areas up to three nautical miles off Tawau, Semporna, Kunak, Lahad Datu, Kinabatangan, Sandakan and Beluran. Sabah’s east coast used to be a major target for kidnap-for-ransom groups, who found it lucrative to abduct tourists from the many islands. Tourism took a dive from 2013 onwards following a spate of tourist kidnappings, but incidences have reduced following the introduction of a curfew from 6pm to 6am four years ago. Since then, the kidnappers have set their sights on fishing trawlers, usually at the borders of international waters."
AFP ‘exhausting all efforts’ to locate abducted school principal in Sulu,"The military’s Western Mindanao Command (Wesmincom) is “exhausting all efforts” to locate the captors and rescue the abducted school principal in Patikul town in Sulu on Thursday morning. Pursuit operations were launched by Joint Task Force Sulu to find Marjorie Abdul, head teacher of Liang Elementary School, who was forcibly taken by armed men at around 9:30 a.m. on Thursday, Wesmincom spokesperson Cpt. Jo-Ann Petinglay said in a statement. “Lateral coordination with the police and the provincial government was established to intensify all pursuit operations, identify the perpetrators and trace their hideouts,” she said, adding that their intelligence resources are being used to obtain more information. “We strongly condemn any kidnapping ploys employed by lawless groups in the province. Rest assured that we will sustain our operations in coordination with law enforcement agencies,” Petinglay said"
"Jolo inmates unlock jail cell, 29 escape","JOLO, Philippines — Police said Sunday they were hunting for 12 of 29 inmates who escaped from a jail on Jolo island that is the stronghold of Islamist militants. The detainees bolted from a prison inside a police station in war-torn Jolo on Saturday where they were being held mostly on drugs charges. The remaining 17 were recaptured the same day, police said. Jolo is a base for the Abu Sayyaf kidnap-for-ransom group and authorities said they were investigating whether or not the inmates who escaped had links with the militants. “A guard went on break, went to the toilet and when he left, the inmates found a way to escape. They picked the lock of the jail cell and fled,” regional police spokesman Senior Inspector Jemar delos Santos told AFP. “We are heightening security around the perimeter of the island municipality and securing ports so that they would not be able to leave Jolo.” The jail had a capacity of about 50 inmates and was located near a port, Delos Santos added. Police replaced all the prison guards as they probed the jailbreak. The Philippines frequently has mass escapes from prisons, which are usually overcrowded, poorly maintained and inadequately guarded. In the country’s biggest jailbreak, more than 150 inmates escaped a prison in the southern Philippines in January last year after about a hundred gunmen stormed the facility. In July 2017, three inmates were killed and another was wounded as 14 prisoners escaped from a jail in Jolo. Islamist militants in the mainly Catholic nation including Abu Sayyaf members pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group as they went on a rampage in the southern city of Marawi. The five-month siege flattened Marawi, claimed more than 1,100 lives and sparked fears IS was seeking to establish a regional base."
Three Indonesian hostages freed in Philippines: Army,"JOLO, Philippines (AFP) - Three Indonesian fishermen held by members of a notorious Islamist kidnap-for-ransom group have walked free 18 months after they were abducted off the southern Philippines, the military said on Sunday (Sept 16). The men were kidnapped in January 2017 while on board a speedboat off the southernmost island group of Tawi-Tawi which, together with the nearby Sulu archipelago, is preyed on by Abu Sayyaf militants. The Indonesians were freed in the town of Indanan in Sulu on Saturday and turned over to the authorities following ""intensified military operations"" against the Abu Sayyaf, a regional army spokesman said without giving details. Asked if a ransom was paid, Lieutenant-Colonel Gerry Besana told Agence France-Presse: ""No, there was definitely no ransom given. (They) were pressured by our operations."" The Abu Sayyaf has been known to behead hostages unless ransom payments are made. The group is a loose network of militants formed in the 1990s with seed money from Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda network. It has earned millions of dollars from banditry and kidnappings-for-ransom, often targeting foreigners. The Abu Sayyaf is based in strife-torn southern islands but its members began in 2016 to kidnap sailors in the waters between Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. The rise in abductions sparked Indonesian warnings that the region could become the ""next Somalia"" and pushed the three neighbours to pledge joint naval patrols. On Sunday, the Philippine military identified the three Indonesians as Hamdam Bin Salim, 34, Subande Satto, 27, and Sudarlan Samansung, 41. The hostages were brought to a military hospital and turned over to the Indonesian ambassador, who was to accompany them to the Philippine capital Manila, a military statement said. The Abu Sayyaf is still holding 11 hostages, including a Dutch bird-watcher abducted in 2012 and a Vietnamese captive, according to Lt-Col Besana."
Malaysia police hunt for four ISIS militants still on the run,"Malaysia's police chief Mohamad Fuzi Harun said in a statement on Monday (April 16) that six members of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) cell were arrested between Feb 27 and March 1. But four others were still on the run. Police said the men were ""dangerous"" and ""capable of launching attacks that could pose a threat to national security"". Clockwise from top left: The suspects listed were named as Muhamad Faizal Muhamad Hanafi, Muhamad Hanafi Yah, both of whom are from Kelantan state, Awae Wae-Eya, a Thai national living in southern Thailand and Nor Farkhan Mohd Isa, whose address was given as being in southern Johor. (Courtesy of Royal Malaysian Police/-) Two of the suspects listed were named as Muhamad Faizal Muhamad Hanafi and Muhamad Hanafi Yah, both from Kelantan state. A third suspect is Nor Farkhan Mohd Isa, whose address was given as being in Taman Ungku Tun Aminah in Skudai, southern Johor. The fourth suspect is Awae Wae-Eya, a Thai national living in Narathiwat province in southern Thailand. ""We have been monitoring the cells for the last few months. We are asking the public to share with us if they have any information on the whereabouts of these four suspects. They should approach the police if they know anything,"" Bukit Aman Special Branch's Counter Terrorism chief Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay told The Straits Times. Intelligence sources say they believe Awae is the group's mastermind, based on interrogation of the six men arrested, and that he is trying to establish an ISIS cell in southern Thailand. The arrests of the other members of the terror cell, which included two men working as janitors in Singapore, were previously announced on March 24. The plot was uncovered after Malaysian counter-terrorism police, aided by their Singaporean counterparts, detained the terrorists in a series of swoops. The order to kidnap and kill policemen was the first of its kind, according to an intelligence source. The six men who were nabbed earlier included a 37-year-old technician who was initially thought to have masterminded the plans to attack places of worship in Johor Baru. The second suspect, a 49-year-old security guard, was the cell's adviser and responsible for keeping the cell and its plans secret. Also picked up during the raids was a 30-year-old security guard, who was tasked with acquiring firearms from a neighbouring country and scouting for non-Muslim houses of worship to target. Another suspect, a 25-year-old waiter, had been ordered to kidnap and kill policemen. Two others, aged 23 and 22, were arrested on March 1 and worked as janitors in Singapore. One of them acted as the intermediary in the purchase of firearms for the cell, while the other was picked up to facilitate police investigations. A member of the Abu Sayyaf group in the Philippines was also arrested during the police crackdown, in Sabah, on March 15. The 31-year-old man is said to be a trusted lieutenant to Furuji Indama, the group's leader based in Basilan. Believed to have connections to Malaysian militant Mahmud Ahmad, he is also wanted by Philippines authorities for involvement in a kidnap-for-ransom syndicate. He is an expert in making improvised explosive devices and had planned to attack several locations in Sabah. Malaysia has arrested nearly 400 people since 2013 for suspected links to terrorism. The Muslim-majority nation faces threats from self-radicalised ISIS sympathisers at home, and regional militant groups which seek funding and refuge in South-east Asia. Malaysia's only terrorist attack took place in June 2016, when two men on a motorcycle lobbed a grenade into a nightclub in Selangor, injuring eight people. The men were sentenced to 25 years' jail each."
 Malaysian police hunting for four suspected ISIS militants,"Malaysian police are hunting for four militants suspected of planning attacks on non-Muslim places of worship, as well as plotting to kidnap and murder police officers. Police chief Mohamad Fuzi Harun said in a statement yesterday that six members of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) cell were arrested between Feb 27 and March 1. But four others were still on the run. Police said the men were ""dangerous"" and ""capable of launching attacks that could pose a threat to national security"". Two of the suspects listed were named as Muhamad Faizal Muhamad Hanafi and Muhamad Hanafi Yah, both from Kelantan. A third suspect is Nor Farkhan Mohd Isa, whose address was given as being in Taman Ungku Tun Aminah in Skudai, southern Johor. The fourth is Awae Wae-Eya, a Thai national living in Narathiwat province in southern Thailand. ""We have been monitoring the cells for the last few months. We are asking the public to share with us if they have any information on the whereabouts of these four suspects. They should approach the police if they know anything,"" the Special Branch's Counter Terrorism chief Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay told The Straits Times. Intelligence sources say they believe Awae is the group's mastermind, based on interrogation of the six men arrested, and that he is trying to establish an ISIS cell in southern Thailand. From left: Terror suspects Awae Wae-Eya, Muhamad Hanafi Yah, Nor Farkhan Mohd Isa and Muhamad Faizal Muhamad Hanafi are still at large. The arrests of the other members of the terror cell, which included two men working as janitors in Singapore, were previously announced on March 24. The plot was uncovered after Malaysian counter-terrorism police, aided by their Singaporean counterparts, detained the terrorists in a series of swoops. The order to kidnap and kill policemen was the first of its kind, according to an intelligence source. The six men nabbed earlier included a 37-year-old technician who was initially thought to have masterminded the plans to attack places of worship in Johor Baru. The second suspect, a 49-year-old security guard, was the cell's adviser and responsible for keeping the cell and its plans secret. Also picked up during the raids was a 30-year old security guard, tasked with acquiring firearms from a neighbouring country and scouting for non-Muslim houses of worship to target. Another suspect, a 25-year-old waiter, had been ordered to kidnap and kill policemen. Two others, aged 23 and 22, were arrested on March 1 and worked as janitors in Singapore. One of them acted as an intermediary to buy firearms. The other was picked up to facilitate police investigations. A member of the Abu Sayyaf group in the Philippines was also arrested during the police crackdown in Sabah on March 15. The 31-year-old man is said to be a trusted lieutenant to Furuji Indama, the group's leader based in Basilan and believed to have connections to Malaysian militant Mahmud Ahmad. He is an expert in making improvised explosive devices and had planned to attack several locations in Sabah. Malaysia has arrested nearly 400 people since 2013 for suspected links to terrorism."
Malaysia holds Filipinos seeking to set up extremist cell ,"Ten suspected Islamic militants who were trying to establish a Malaysian cell of a Philippine kidnap-for-ransom group have been arrested in Borneo island, police said Wednesday. The alleged extremists, mostly Filipinos, are also accused of trying to help fighters linked to the Islamic State (IS) group travel to the country to join up with militants here, they said. Mindanao has long been a pocket of Islamic militancy in the largely Catholic country. A long siege in Marawi, the country’s main Muslim center, sparked fears IS was seeking to establish a foothold in the region. Malaysian police made the arrests in January and early February in Sabah state on the Malaysian part of Borneo, not far from the southern Philippines. Borneo is a vast island shared between Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei. Seven of those detained were Filipinos, including several senior members of the extremist group Abu Sayyaf which has been behind the kidnappings of numerous foreigners, Malaysian national police chief Mohamad Fuzi Harun said in a statement. “Early information obtained from the 10 suspects caught in Sabah revealed an attempt by the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group to set up a cell in Sabah,” he said. One of those arrested was a 39-year-old believed to have received orders from a senior militant leader in the southern Philippines to bring IS members from the city of Sandakan in Sabah to join militant groups. Another suspect was a 27-year-old identified as a senior member of the Abu Sayyaf Group. The other three detained were Malaysians, police said. Officials did not disclose the suspects’ identities. Malaysia has rounded up numerous suspected militants in recent times as fears grow that the influence of the IS group could encourage extremists to launch attacks in the Muslim-majority country. Abu Sayyaf, originally a loose network of militants formed in the 1990s with seed money from Osama bin Laden’s Al-Qaeda network, has splintered into factions, with some continuing to engage in banditry and kidnappings. One faction pledged allegiance to IS and joined militants in the siege of Marawi, which claimed more than 1,100 lives."
6 Scout Rangers wounded in clash with Abu Sayyaf in Sulu," ZAMBOANGA CITY – A fierce clash between security forces and Abu Sayyaf bandits in Patikul, Sulu on Tuesday resulted in the wounding of six Scout Rangers, the military reported Wednesday. Brig. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, commander of Joint Task Force Sulu, said at least five bandits were reportedly killed based on information from ground sources. Sobejana said soldiers were conducting a “focused” military operation early morning Tuesday when they clashed with an Abu Sayyaf group under Radulan Sahiron in Barangay Panglahayan. The firefight lasted until about noontime, he said. Two of the wounded soldiers had to be airlifted here and taken to a private hospital. Four others remained at the Kuta Teodolfo Bautista Trauma Hospital in Jolo, according to Sobejana. Lt. Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr., the commander of the Western Mindanao Command, described the positions of the clashing forces as very close at about 20 meters. “That is why they [Scout Rangers] were able to fire at the enemy at close range. They were just very careful due to the possible presence of kidnap victims with the Abu Sayyaf,” Galvez said. He said the military pounded the retreating bandits with howitzers and mortars. Galvez said in the aftermath of the clash, the pursuing soldiers recovered two M16 rifles. “The Joint Task Force Sulu continues to employ more pressure on the remaining Abu Sayyaf bandits to rescue captives and gain more enemy strongholds and armaments,” Sobejana said."
ESSCom heightens security following kidnap threats,"LAHAD DATU, Oct 31 — The Eastern Sabah Security Command (ESSCom) has heightened security and mobilised all its assets at sea as well as control posts following threats by the Abu Sayyaf Group of conducting kidnapping activities in the region. ESSCom commander DCP Datuk Hazani Ghazali in a statement today urged the community in the Eastern Sabah Security Zone (ESSZone) to inform ESSCom of any suspicious activities via its hotline at 089-863181 for immediate action. Yesterday, online portal Marine Link posted a statement from a source in the Philippine Coast Guard, saying that a group of about 10 Abu Sayyaf members armed with pistols, rifles and grenade launchers was planning to conduct kidnapping activities at any opportune time in undisclosed areas in Sabah, primarily targeting businessmen or crew of foreign vessels passing through the area. They are using unmarked blue and white coloured ‘motor bancas’ (Philippine boats). Ship masters and crew are strongly urged to exercise extra vigilance when transiting the waters off Eastern Sabah (Malaysia) as well as the seas of Sulu and Celebes."
 A new deadline to wipe out Abu Sayyaf ," AT the start of 2017, President Duterte,  then  just a few months in office, gave the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) six months to neutralize the Abu Sayyaf. The  notorious  group had just kidnapped a German yacht owner after killing his wife in the waters around Sulu and was now demanding ransom. Earlier in 2015, the Abu Sayyaf had kidnapped three foreigners and a Filipina in the Davao Gulf, then killed two of the foreigners, both Canadians. It was then said to be holding about 20  other hostages of various nationalities, all for ransom. The deadline for the presidential order was June 30, 2017, but the AFP drive was overtaken by the  siege of Marawi on May 23. On that day, forces of the Maute Group, supported by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS),  seized the city center in a war that was to rage in the next five months as the whole of Mindanao was placed under martial law. Early this  month , the Abu Sayyaf  was again in the news. After kidnapping two policewomen in Patikul, Sulu,  on April 29, the outlaw group reportedly released them in Talipao, Sulu.  Their relatives paid R2.5 million for their release, down from  an original demand of R5 million,  according to one source, after negotiation by a leader of the Moro National Liberation Front. Government forces in Sulu have now been given a new deadline to wipe out the Abu Sayyaf – December this year,  seven months from now. Brig. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, commander of Joint Task Force Sulu, said  the  deadline was issued by the new Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) chief-of-staff Gen. Carlito Galvez at  a command conference  in Zamboanga City last Wednesday. Ten Army battalions have been deployed in Sulu  and  an additional battalion is coming from Marawi. These forces, together with units of the Philippine National Police (PNP), now led by its new chief, Director General Oscar Albayalde,   will mount the new campaign to wipe  out  the Abu Sayyaf. Mindanao has long been a problem area for the government, with two major groups – the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) – having mass support. The Duterte administration is well on  the  way to ending  age-old problems with  them with the proposed Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. There are, however, many smaller outlaw groups which have been thriving in Mindanao. The Abu Sayyaf is perhaps the most notorious of them, with  kidnapping for ransom  as its forte. The initial effort of the Duterte administration to eliminate the Abu Sayyaf in 2017 was thwarted by the Marawi rebellion of the Maute Group. But now, with that operation over and with the new chiefs of  the AFP and the PNP, government forces should be able to put an end to this group which has gained international notoriety  because of its foreign kidnap victims, and carry  out at long last President Duterte’s  order to wipe it out."
Former Abu Sayyaf sniper aims to regain lost childhood,"ISABELA CITY — Ten-year-old “Tony” has recently gone back to school, in a madrassa where he can continue learning Arabic—and be a child again. Only four years ago, Tony did not even have the opportunity to play, let alone attend classes. Instead, he lugged around an M4 assault rifle and was attacking and evading government troops as a member of the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group. The boy proved to be no ordinary fighter and was deemed one of the sharpest among the 30 young combatants under the command of Motong Indama, a  younger cousin of Abu Sayyaf leader Furudji Indama. “The training took about a year,” recalled Tony.  “I was taught how to handle a gun. The [Abu Sayyaf members] were so happy with me that they called me the Tipo-Tipo sniper,” he added. Tipo-Tipo was the Basilan town that his group had tried to overrun in 2016, setting off clashes with government soldiers that dragged on for three months. Though Tony had suffered his first combat wounds in a skirmish even before those encounters, he emerged more gung-ho and unafraid of death. When Motong surrendered in July 2016, Tony was one of the 11 among his men who followed. The boy now lives with his uncles under the close supervision of Sumisip town officials. In an interview with the Inquirer last week, Tony said his mother died after being “shot by a soldier” while she was bathing in a river.  His father and three elder siblings were later killed in “another military operation.” He learned about their violent deaths from his two remaining siblings, who were then only in their late teens. The orphan was only 6 when his brothers took him along to join the Abu Sayyaf, then led by Motong and  subleader Radsmil Jannatul. In the jungle, Tony learned how to fire a gun faster than he learned how to read. Soon he was earning notice as a marksman, a scrawny one at that, who could negotiate steep mountain paths and climb tall trees with ease to spot enemies from afar. Death had always stalked him—if not by bullets, then by starvation. “The best part of my life back then was having vegetables and dried fish for a meal; it was considered that special,” he recalled. Despite the Abu Sayyaf’s notoriety as kidnappers who demanded millions of pesos in ransom, the boy said that as far as he knew, Motong’s men were only “tasked to fight” and did not take hostages during his time with the group. In hindsight, he said, the adrenaline rush he felt when the fighting began had made him numb to all the hardships he faced, more so after he got wounded. When word got around that Motong was turning himself in, one of Tony’s siblings who had dragged him into the group thought that his kid brother had had enough. “Now I just want to study in the Islamic school,” the boy said. Tony was one of the 179 Abu Sayyaf surrenderers from Basilan and Sulu whom the regional government of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) hopes to assist in their return to normal life through an initiative called Program Against Violent Extremism (PAVE). Under the program launched earlier this month, surrenderers are provided medical services, housing, livelihood training and alternative learning sessions. But the idea found some resistance among those who had fallen victim to the Abu Sayyaf, acknowledged ARMM Gov. Mujiv Hataman. “I know many people were hurt by this move, especially the kidnap victims.  And while we have not talked about this yet, we are reaching out.  The healing is not complete if the victims are not with us on this. There is no total peace, no total justice, if the former victims are not willing [to join us in this idea],” Hataman added. The governor assured critics that the selected PAVE beneficiaries were “those without [criminal] cases.” “Instead of teaching them to farm, which is [something they have to do] near the mountains, we agreed to teach them how to market their goods, [as well as the] technology for making ginger tea, peanut butter, etc.,” Hataman said, explaining how the program had been designed with the beneficiaries’ situation in mind. The military is supporting the effort. “I have read hundreds of books on terrorism, all foreign models. We are confronted with a homegrown terror group [so] only a homegrown solution is applicable here,” said Brig. Gen. Juvymax Uy, commander of Task Force Basilan. In Tony’s case, that solution may be to give him time to heal his inner wounds from living in the jungle, and again become just another child."
ASG gunmen kidnap 10-year-old boy in Sulu ,"ZAMBOANGA CITY – Suspected Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) gunmen strike anew and kidnapped a 10-year-old pupil of an elementary school in Jolo, Sulu province early Thursday morning. Armed Forces of the Philippines – Western Mindanao Command (AFP-WesMinCom) Spokesman Army Lt Col. Gerry M Besana identified the victim as Zaire Khan Pasil, 10, student, and resident of Sheik Mustafa Subdivision, Upper San Raymundo, Jolo, Sulu. Besana said the incident took place at about 7:20 am while the young Pasil was on his way to the Notre Dame Elementary School. Besana added that Pasil was with Aldasir Tallow, driver, and Fatima Zaima Pasil, 13 were on their way to Notre Dame Elementary School onboard an owner type jeep from their residence when the incident transpired. The military reported that about six ASG gunmen riding in tandem onboard three motorcycles took the victim along Latih-Jolo Road."
France supermarket attacker was not deemed extremist threat: Interior Minister,"TREBES, France: The man who killed three people in a shooting spree and hostage siege in southern France on Friday was known to police but was not considered a terror threat, Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said. Collomb named the gunman, who was killed by police, as 26-year-old Redouane Lakdim and described him as a small-time drug dealer. ""He was known by the police for petty crimes, we had monitored him and did not think he had been radicalised,"" Collomb said after arriving at the scene of the hostage-taking in the town of Trebes, near Carcassonne. ""He was already under surveillance when he suddenly decided to act,"" he said. Security sources had said the gunman was believed to be a Moroccan who was on a watch list of suspected Islamic extremists, but Collomb did not confirm his nationality. Witnesses said Lakdim shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest) at a supermarket in Trebes, where he took several people hostage after opening fire on passengers in a car and a police officer in nearby Carcassonne. He eventually let the hostages go after a policeman offered to take their place. Security forces stormed the store after he shot the officer who was seriously wounded, Collomb said."
 Iran embassy in Ankara receives ‘suicide bomb threat’,"ANKARA, Oct 16 — An individual who claimed to have links to the Islamic State extremist group threatened to attack the Iranian embassy in Ankara, Tehran’s envoy in Turkey said yesterday, denying Turkish media reports that he had been evacuated. “The suicide attack against the embassy was only a threat,” Ambassador Mohammad Ebrahim Taherian Fard said. “Nothing significant has happened and things are under control.” “The threat was made by someone who introduced himself as linked to Daesh,” Fard said, quoted by state news agency IRNA and referring to IS by its Arabic acronym. Turkish media said Fard had been evacuated but the ambassador and Tehran flatly denied the report as a complete fabrication. “Such a claim is a sheer lie, and the personnel at our embassy are present at their workplace in full health and security,” the foreign ministry said in a statement on its website. Earlier yesterday, DHA news agency said Iran’s mission in the Turkish capital had been given an intelligence warning about a possible suicide bomb attack. The road by the embassy was shut off and police could be seen searching cars in the area, an AFP photographer said earlier yesterday. Ambassador Fard also said Turkish police “intensified security measures” around Tehran’s mission in Ankara in response to the threat. In 2015 and 2016, Turkey was hit by a series of terror attacks which were blamed on both Kurdish militants and the Islamic State jihadist group. The last attack blamed on IS was in January 2017 when a gunman killed 39 people at an elite Istanbul nightclub during New Year celebrations. Since then, Turkish police have conducted regular raids across the country against suspected IS jihadists. They have also regularly targeted members of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which is blacklisted as a terrorist organisation by Ankara and its Western allies. "
Russia poses bigger threat to UK than terror groups: Army chief," Russia ""indisputably"" now poses a bigger threat to Britain's security than terrorist groups like Islamic State (IS) and Al-Qaeda, the head of the British army said in an interview published Saturday. General Mark Carleton-Smith warned Moscow had shown a willingness to use its military to pursue its national interests while seeking to ""exploit Western vulnerabilities"". ""Russia today indisputably represents a far greater threat to our national security than Islamic extremist threats such as Al-Qaeda and (IS),"" he told The Daily Telegraph. ""Russia has embarked on a systematic effort to explore and exploit Western vulnerabilities, particularly in some of the non-traditional areas of cyber, space, undersea warfare."" Relations between Russia and Britain have sunk to historic lows this year. London has blamed the country's military intelligence service for orchestrating the poisoning with a nerve agent of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury in March. The incident prompted a wave of tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions between Moscow and the West, as well as a ratcheting up of US sanctions. Carleton-Smith, 54, said following IS battlefield loses in Syria and Iraq, the Western alliance must switch focus to the threat posed by Russia -- and do so through NATO. ""The physical manifestation of the Islamist threat has diminished with the complete destruction of the geography of the so-called Caliphate,"" he said. ""We cannot be complacent about the threat Russia poses or leave it uncontested. ""The most important conventional military response to Russia is the continued capabilities and coherence of the NATO alliance."" The former special forces commander was speaking in his first interview since becoming Britain's chief of the general staff in June. He made the comments after visiting British troops deployed in Estonia as part of a NATO battle group intended to deter aggression from neighbouring Russia. Carleton-Smith also took the opportunity to downplay the need for a separate European army, as recently encouraged by French President Emmanuel Macron. ""I would not support any initiative that diluted the military effectiveness of NATO,"" he said. ""It has been an extraordinarily successful alliance and, in my experience, we should reinforce success."""
 Violent extremism a threat without Bangsamoro Law: Esperon," Violent extremism may ensue if Congress fails to pass the proposed Bangsamoro Basic Law, National Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon said Tuesday. Extremism is fueled by a ""complex mixed of grievances"" resulting from the loss of ancestral homelands, poverty, marginalization and poor governance, Esperon told senators.   ""The passage of the BBL is arguably the most effective legislative response to these grievances,"" he said during the resumption of Senate hearings into the measure. The proposed law will allow the country's main Muslim separatist group to transition into a political organization that participates in elections, he said.   Failure to pass the BBL, on the other hand, will result in ""the exact opposite -- a grimmer picture that is already taking form because of continuous delay [in the law's passage]."" The Moro people are growing dissatisfied with the peace process, as indicated by the 2016 bombings in Davao City and the terrorist siege of Marawi City last year, he said. ""One of the most pronounced threats is that of Muslim communities turning away from the peace process and providing dangerous opportunities for recruitment by violent extremist groups and the propagation of more radical views among the youth and the vulnerable sectors in Mindanao,"" he said. ""And that scenario -- the possibility of war in Mindanao -- as we have seen it and President Duterte is warning about, is not far off,"" he said."

Melbourne knife attacker named as known extremist," MELBOURNE, Nov 10 — A Somali-born Australian who carried out a deadly knife rampage in Melbourne held extremist views and was known to intelligence services, authorities said today, as they carried out raids and interviewed dozens of witnesses. Australian Federal Police said 30-year-old Hassan Khalif Shire Ali — who was shot dead after driving a 4x4 laden with gas cylinders into the city centre and stabbing three people — fled to Australia as a child with his family in the 1980s. He stabbed three people before being confronted by members of the public and armed officers who eventually shot him in the chest. One of his victims died at the scene while two others were wounded. Authorities have questioned around 35 people who saw the rush hour attack, which although crude, was said to have been designed to “cause terror and cause maximum casualties” in the heart Australia’s bustling second city. Armed officers raided two addresses in the west and northeast of the city, linked to the perpetrator’s family and associates, although there is not thought to be an ongoing threat. The man killed by Shire Ali was named by local media as 74-year-old Sisto Malaspina, an icon of Melbourne’s thriving culinary culture who ran a famous Italian cafe. Two other men wounded in the attack are still being treated but are expected to make a recovery. Australian authorities now face difficult questions about how Shire Ali, who was known to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation for at least three years, was able to carry out an attack. He had his Australian passport revoked in 2015 amid fears he was trying to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State group. His brother will go on trial next year on separate terror-related charges — accused of trying to acquire a firearm and kill people in a New Years’ Eve crowd. “The assessment was made that whilst he had radicalised views he didn’t pose a threat to the national security environment,” Ian Mccartney, a federal police counterterrorism official said of Shire Ali. Mccartney described the attack as a “wake up call” even as the Islamic State loses territory in Iraq and Syria, where Australian forces are part of a coalition fighting the group. “The circumstances of how he and when he moved from having these radicalised views to carrying out this attack yesterday will be a key focus of the investigation,” Mccartney added. The Islamic State group — which often claims responsibility for such attacks — said via its propaganda arm that the perpetrator was an “Islamic State fighter and carried out the operation.” It provided no evidence to back its claim. Witness footage showed police struggling for at least a minute to corral the towering man as he lunged, slashed and stabbed wildly at two officers. At least two members of the public stepped in to help police. One man was armed with a cafe chair while another — swiftly dubbed an “Aussie hero” on social media — repeatedly tried to ram the suspect with an empty metal shopping cart. But the attacks continued unabated before one officer opted for lethal force, shooting the suspect in the chest. The officers “tried to verbally deescalate” said Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton. “Once the officer is off the view that there is an imminent threat to life,” he added. “That is when firearms are drawn.” Witness Chris Newport, 60, described how he had been returning from a job interview when he heard a loud noise and saw a truck on fire, rolling across the tram tracks before a second, louder bang. “In a split second everything changes” Newport told AFP, describing Shire Ali manically brandishing a knife. “You can’t imagine someone deciding to do that.” Police said that his improvised explosive device was made up of gas cylinders and some form of lighter and “certainly wasn’t sophisticated”. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the country would be unflinching in the fight against “radical, violent... extremist Islam that opposes our very way of life”. Shire Ali “sought to instill fear in our nation. Like those who tried before him, this terrorist failed,” he said. He cited more than a dozen foiled terror plots as evidence that Australians could have faith in their counterterrorism authorities. Melbourne is Australia’s second largest city, a cosmopolitan metropolis of almost five million people famed for its cafes, bars, restaurants and high standard of living. Yesterday’s attack was a double blow for the city as it coincides with an ongoing murder trial of 28-year-old James Gargasoulas, accused of ploughing his car into crowds in the same area in 2017, killing six people. The motives for that attack are still unclear. "
Home-grown terror group JAD remains a threat in Indonesia despite crackdowns: Experts," JAKARTA (THE JAKARTA POST/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), an Indonesian home-grown terror group affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), remains a threat in the country despite recent crackdowns, the latest report by Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (Ipac) has said. ISIS is also known as Islamic State (IS). The report, issued last Thursday (Oct 18), said the terror group would continue to launch attacks even though law enforcers have been searching for its members across the country following deadly suicide bombings in Surabaya, East Java, in May. ""The defeats of the IS in the Middle East have not weakened the determination of IS supporters to wage war at home since they can no longer get to Syria,"" Ipac director Sidney Jones said. Future attacks, the Ipac said, might occur after ""a period of dormancy"" in which surveillance eases and complacency returns. The Ipac predicted such attacks might occur outside East Java, especially in areas around the West Java-Central Java border, such as West Java's Cirebon and Indramayu, as well as Central Java's Tegal, which was described by the researchers as regions where a ""critical mass of supporters was still active"", showing a high degree of militancy. The areas, the report said, have been producing terrorists since the deadly Thamrin attack in Jakarta in January 2016. Poso in Central Sulawesi also came under the spotlight in the Ipac report, especially after earthquakes and a tsunami hit the province on Sept 28, causing several prisoners to escape. While some returned, others are still at large to date. ""It is also not impossible that extremists could see the area as fertile recruiting ground, given unhappiness with the slow pace of aid deliveries and a well-entrenched extremist network in the area,"" the report said. University of Indonesia (UI) terrorist expert Ridwan Habib echoed the sentiment and warned that attacks might come ahead of the 2019 general election. In August, the South Jakarta District Court declared JAD a ""forbidden organisation"" and found it guilty of committing a number of terror acts. The ruling enables the police and their counter-terrorism squad Densus 88 to use newly added provisions in the Terrorism Law to prosecute individuals who intentionally recruit for or join an organisation declared a terror group by the court. As of Sunday (Oct 21), the police had conducted dozens of raids on suspected JAD members, including in the latest operation in North Sumatra. The North Sumatra Police said last Friday that its personnel killed two suspected terrorists and JAD members, and seized makeshift bombs, weapons and ammunition during a raid in Tanjung Balai, a day before they allegedly plotted attacks on temples and police stations in the city. Mr Ridwan, however, said law enforcement had yet to be effective in eradicating terror groups. ""The arrest in Tanjung Balai indicates there is coordination between JAD members and attempts to build bombs are still ongoing. There is no deterrent effect,"" he said. The Ipac also criticised the police's capability of monitoring people suspected of having a connection with terror groups, saying that ""surveillance of the (Surabaya bombing) perpetrators had stopped about three months before the attacks"". According to the report, JAD Surabaya leader Dita Oepriarto had shown more signs of deliberate interaction with neighbours to present an image of ""normal, pious Muslims"", while at the same time Dita had allegedly been assembling at least 100 pipe bombs. Dita, the suspected mastermind behind the suicide bombings in all three churches in Surabaya, blew himself up in one of the attacks. ""It was this willingness to engage with the community that became one factor in the police's decision to stop surveillance,"" the Ipac said."
Paris knifeman's murky path from 'reserved' student to extremist,"PARIS (AFP) - Khamzat Azimov, who kept his beard short over a youthful face, was not considered a major threat despite being on France's two watchlists for suspected extremists since 2016. ""It was his relatives who alerted the security services, as opposed to his behaviour, actions or ideas"" which might have drawn scrutiny, a source close to the inquiry told AFP. Yet on Saturday (May 12) night, the 20-year-old described by neighbours as a quiet student spread terror throughout a bustling area of restaurants and theatres just a short stroll from the historic Paris opera house. Former classmates from his Strasbourg high school described Azimov as a religious and ""very discreet"" student who liked video games and sports. The eastern French town where he grew up is home to a large community of refugees from Chechnya who fled the Muslim-dominated Russian republic during two bloody separatist wars against Moscow-backed forces. One ex-pupil told AFP: ""Khamzat was quite calm, he kept himself to himself, he didn't have a problem... He did Ramadan, he paid attention to girls."" The man who declined to be identified added that Azimov ""had a distinctive manner and was in contact with Syria where he wanted to go. But after the bac (exams) he left all that, he wanted to make a living."" Another former pupil described a ""normal student, not excellent but not bad either"". ""We knew he was Muslim but he did not show it,"" the young woman added, saying he never talked about his birthplace Chechnya or the wars there. Investigators have taken Azimov's parents into custody for questioning as well as a friend in Strasbourg. The conflict in Chechnya gave birth to a fierce Islamic insurgency that would eventually produce fighters who would join other militant groups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, which claimed responsibility for Saturday's attack in Paris. But a manager of the apartments in the northern 18th arrondissement of the French capital where the Azimovs rented a room said there was nothing overtly religious about the family. Calling them ""very discreet,"" the woman said ""there was nothing ostentatious in terms of religion"" and described Khamzat Azimov as a young man who favoured tracksuits and ""said he was a student"". A neighbour also spoke of ""a very discreet family, never any problems,"" adding that they ""never received visitors"". And the son ""wasn't a thug, but someone who was reserved,"" she added. ""They have been living here for a little over a year,"" said Reda, another resident in the building. ""The father worked sometimes, mostly in construction, painting. The mother worked for an association which helps the homeless,"" she said. Witnesses to Saturday's attack said Azimov remained composed as he began attacking people with a 10-centimetre (four inches) blade shortly before 9pm (3am Singapore time). ""He approached calmly, a total contrast with the panic all around him,"" said Romain, 34, who was placing an order with his wife and six-year-old son at the Starbucks cafe on the Avenue de l'Opera. ""He had a beard, not very long, and was dressed normally. He didn't fit the stereotype"" of a jihadist, he said. Investigators have yet to reveal how Azimov became radicalised. One source told AFP he had been questioned by anti-terror investigators last year ""because he knew a man who was in contact with a person who had gone to Syria."" He did not have a criminal record, and became a French citizen as a teenager in 2010 following his mother's naturalisation. But his attack echoed a similar one last October, when a knifeman who also carried no ID papers began stabbing people at the main train station in the southern city of Marseille, killing two people. That attack was also claimed by ISIS."
"Melbourne knife attacker inspired by ISIS, say police; PM Morrison says terror threat 'probable' in Australia","MELBOURNE (REUTERS) - A Somali-born man who set fire to a truck laden with gas cylinders in the centre of Melbourne and fatally stabbed one person was inspired by Islamic State but did not have direct links with the group, Australian police said on Saturday (Nov 10). Police identified the man responsible for Friday's attack as 30-year-old Hassan Khalif Shire Ali and said he was radicalised and inspired by the militant group's propaganda. He was shot by police and died in hospital. Police said Shire Ali's Australian passport was cancelled in 2015 after an intelligence report he planned to travel to Syria, but an assessment was made that while he had radical views, he posed no threat to national security. Islamic State, also known as Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), had claimed responsibility for the attack, which came two days before Remembrance Day, marking 100 years since the end of World War One, without providing any evidence. ""I think it is fair to say he (Shire Ali) was inspired. He was radicalised,"" Australian Federal Police Acting Deputy Commissioner Ian McCartney told reporters in Melbourne. ""We're not saying there was direct contact. We're saying it was more from an inspiration perspective."" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the national terrorism advisory remained at ""probable"", the midpoint of a five-tier system, and told reporters in Sydney that radical Islam was the issue. ""I need to call it out. Radical, violent, extremist Islam that opposes our very way of life. I am the first to protect religious freedom in this country, but that also means I must be the first to call out religious extremism,"" he said. Friday's attack began just before the evening rush hour and lasted only minutes. Shire Ali stabbed bystanders and attacked police while his utility truck carrying barbecue gas cylinders burned on busy Bourke Street. The cylinders did not explode and the fire was put out in 10 minutes, by which point the attack was over, though not before one man was fatally stabbed. Police said he was a 74-year-old man who worked in the city, but did not release his name. Local media identified him as a restaurant owner. ""This shouldn't happen in a city like Melbourne,"" one witness who had returned to the scene on Saturday told Reuters, crying. ""I just want to forget it,"" she said. Video posted to Twitter and broadcast on television showed Shire Ali swinging a knife at two police officers, while the truck burned in the background, before he collapsed when one shot him in the chest. Victoria state police said counter-terrorism investigators were searching two properties in suburban Melbourne in connection with the attack, but there was no immediate word on what the searches yielded. At one, a modest one-storey brick house on the city's western fringe, armed officers wearing masks stood guard outside. Bourke Street also reopened on Saturday morning, and a Reuters reporter said there was an increased police presence in the area. A staunch US ally, Australia has been on alert for such violence after a Sydney cafe siege in 2014, and its intelligence agencies have stepped up scrutiny. Victoria Police Commissioner Graham Ashton said there was no warning of the latest attack. He said there was no longer a threat to the public, but that security would be boosted at horse races and Remembrance Day memorials over the weekend. Authorities say Australia's vigilance has helped foil at least a dozen plots, including a plan to attack Melbourne at Christmas in 2016 and a plan to blow up a flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi using a bomb disguised as a meat mincer. Two hostages were killed during the 17-hour Sydney cafe siege by a ""lone wolf"" gunman who was inspired by Islamic State militants."
Jakarta Hosts Subregional Security Meeting Focused on Changing Terrorist Strategies,"Nusa Dua. Chief Security Minister Wiranto and Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton led a subregional meeting on counterterrorism in Jakarta on Tuesday to discuss changing terrorist strategies and tactics. ""Terrorists have modified both their strategies and patterns of attack. They used to act as one organization, but now their attacks come from smaller units, or from self-initiated plans or lone wolves, also involving women and children,"" the Coordinating Ministry for Political, Legal and Security Affairs said in a statement. In his opening address, Dutton said the meeting serves as an important and timely opportunity to discuss ""the insidious and ever-adaptive threat of terrorism."" ""Regrettably, the threat of terrorism has not abated. Recent attacks in Indonesia were a sobering reminder of the influence of Islamic State in our region,"" he said, referring to the series of attacks in Surabaya, East Java, in May. Dutton added that the attacks were a reminder of the importance of regional cooperation to ""combat this very real and persistent threat."" He said one of the emerging challenges in the region is new and evolving technologies, such as encryption used by terrorists. Representatives of Brunei, Malaysia, Myanmar, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand also participated in the meeting held to promote cooperation between governments and civil society organizations to prevent the spread of radical and extremist ideologies. ""Enhanced cooperation with regional and global partners is imperative to get ahead of terrorist networks, their technology and their tactics,"" Dutton said. Wiranto meanwhile touched on how former terrorists can be part of counterterrorism strategies. ""They can be used to dismantle existing networks of foreign terrorist fighters,"" he said, as quoted by Suara Pembaruan. He added that foreign fighters pose as a real threat to the region because they have received training and experience in conflict areas, such as Syria and Iraq, where Islamic State is most active. The inaugural subregional meeting on counterterrorism took place in Manado, North Sulawesi, in July last year. This year's meeting was initially scheduled for Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara, in August but had to be postponed after a series of powerful earthquakes rocked the island."
 Germany uncovers terrorist group which attacked foreigners in Chemnitz,"related media assets (image or videos) available. Click to see the gallery. 3 related media assets (image or videos) available. Click to see the gallery. German police detained six men on Monday suspected of forming a far-right militant organisation which assaulted foreigners in the eastern city of Chemnitz and planning attacks on politicians and civil servants, the GBA federal prosecutor's office said. KARLSRUHE, Germany: German police detained six men on Monday suspected of forming a far-right militant organisation which assaulted foreigners in the eastern city of Chemnitz and planning attacks on politicians and civil servants, the GBA federal prosecutor's office said. Some 100 police officers backed by special commando units detained the six suspects aged 20 to 30 at locations in Germany's Saxony and Bavaria states. Authorities also revealed that another suspect had been taken into custody on Sept. 14. The men are accused of forming ""Revolution Chemnitz"", an organisation named after the city where the fatal stabbing of a German man blamed on migrants in August prompted the worst far-right violence in Germany in decades. ""Based on the information we have so far, the suspects belong to the hooligan, skinhead and neo-Nazi scene in the area of Chemnitz and considered themselves leading figures in the right-wing extremist scene in Saxony,"" prosecutors said. The group had planned to attack senior civil servants and politicians, they said. ""In the course of further investigations we encountered tangible indications that the organisation pursued terrorist goals,"" the GBA said in a statement. GBA spokeswoman Frauke Koehler told reporters that the authorities had intercepted communications which showed that the suspects were plotting attacks against political opponents as well as foreigners. Five of the suspects had attacked and injured foreigners in Chemnitz on Sept. 14 using glass bottles, steel knuckle gloves and tasers, the GBA statement said. The group had planned to carry out another attack on Oct. 3, the national holiday that marks the reunification of East and West Germany in 1991. The violence in Chemnitz, where skinheads hounded migrants and performed the illegal Hitler salute, exposed deep divisions over Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision in 2015 to welcome almost one million mostly Muslim asylum seekers. The events also strained Merkel's coalition government. Her conservatives and their Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners could not agree what to do with the head of the BfV domestic spy agency, who questioned the authenticity of a video showing skinheads chasing migrants. They reached a compromise last month to transfer him to the interior ministry, ending a row that almost felled their six-month-old government. The events in Chemnitz also raised questions about whether authorities in Saxony were too complacent in the face of rising far-right violence and xenophobia, in a country sensitive to whether the lessons of its Nazi past have been learned. The reputation of Germany's law enforcement was hurt by the handling of case of a neo-Nazi gang that murdered 10 people during a 2000-2007 campaign of racially motivated violence. Two members of the group, the National Socialist Underground (NSU), killed themselves in 2011 when police discovered the gang by chance. Another member was jailed for life in July. The Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper said investigators believed ""Revolution Chemnitz"" would have carried out more murders than the NSU. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said after the arrests on Monday that the threat of a militant attack in Germany remains high, which means ""an attack could take place any moment."""
Saudi Arabia says revamping education to combat ‘extremist ideologies’,"RIYADH, March 21 — Saudi Arabia is revamping its education curriculum to eradicate any trace of Muslim Brotherhood influence and will dismiss anyone working in the sector who sympathises with the banned group, the education minister said. Promoting a more moderate form of Islam is one of the promises made by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman under plans to modernise the deeply conservative Muslim kingdom. The education ministry is working to “combat extremist ideologies by reviewing school curricula and books to ensure they do not reflect the banned Muslim Brotherhood’s agenda,” al-Isa said in a statement issued on Tuesday. It would “ban such books from schools and universities and remove those who sympathise with the group or its ideology from their posts,” he added. In September, a large Saudi public university announced it would dismiss employees suspected of ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, adding to concerns that the government is clamping down on its critics in academia and beyond. Earlier this month, Crown Prince Mohammed told CBS in an interview that Saudi schools have been “invaded” by elements of the Muslim Brotherhood, which has been designated by Saudi Arabia as a terrorist organisation along with other militant groups such as al Qaeda and Islamic State. The young crown prince has already taken some steps to loosen Saudi Arabia’s ultra-strict social restrictions, scaling back the role of religious morality police, permitting public concerts and announcing plans to allow women to drive. The ruling Al Saud family has always regarded Islamist groups as a major internal threat to its rule over a country where appeals to religious sentiment resonate deeply and an al Qaeda campaign a decade ago killed hundreds. Since the kingdom’s founding, the Al Saud have enjoyed a close alliance with clerics of the ultra-conservative Wahhabi school of Islam who have espoused a political philosophy that demands obedience to the ruler. By contrast the Brotherhood advances an active political doctrine urging revolutionary action. A political Islamist organisation founded in Egypt nearly a century ago, the Muslim Brotherhood says it is committed to peaceful activism and reform through elections, and its adherents span the region, holding elected office in Arab countries from Tunisia to Jordan. Brotherhood members fleeing repression in Egypt, Syria and Iraq half a century ago took shelter in Saudi Arabia, some taking up roles in the kingdom’s education system and helping to establish the Sahwa or “Awakening” movement which agitated in the 1990s for democracy. The Sahwa mostly fizzled, with some activists arrested and others coaxed into conformity, though admirers and its appeal lingered."
"Parliament: Bigger budget vital to deal with terror threat, says Shanmugam","The scourge of terrorism looming over Singapore is the leading force pushing the country to budget 11 per cent more than last year to secure its home front. The increase, which will swell the purse of the Home Affairs Ministry to $6.48 billion in financial year 2018, is vital, Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said yesterday. The reason is that the threat from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) extremist group will grow in the region following its defeat in the Middle East. As its fighters return to the region, the ministry ""must do all it can to protect our people"", he said during the debate on his ministry's budget. ""It is our responsibility and accountability to deal with terrorist threats in Singapore,"" he added. The need to invest more in the light of this menace was also underlined by Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat in the Budget Statement he unveiled last week. The threat is at the highest level in recent years, Mr Heng said. Its significance is reflected as well in the nod given to the increase, even as Mr Heng told government agencies their annual budget growth from next year will be reined in to 0.3 per cent from 0.4 per cent of gross domestic product. To battle the terror threat as well as crime, the ministry will triple its annual investments in high-tech solutions in the next two years, said Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo. While terrorism occupied a large part of the speeches of both political leaders, the drug menace was a major concern too. They said the immediate focus in the fight against drugs is on measures to protect victims and rehabilitate offenders. The growing number of Singaporeans who pursue work and educational opportunities abroad may have to wrestle with dissenting views more squarely. Foreign business partners, schoolmates or friends may at times express fundamental disagreement with Singapore's decisions, policies or actions. They could even persuade you to adopt their viewpoint at the expense of supporting our national interests... We need a psychologically resilient people, able to withstand crisis or viral attacks, and not be rattled. If someone comments negatively about Singapore and our immediate response is not to verify the facts, but to instead condemn Singapore and, worse, spread the untruths, we are creating for ourselves a hole in our defence that our adversaries would not hesitate to jump at and widen the divide. SENIOR MINISTER OF STATE FOR DEFENCE MALIKI OSMAN, on correcting falsehoods about Singapore. As for the battle against terrorists, Mr Shanmugam said his ministry will play the lead role, with the police as the ""first and main responders"" in a terror attack. This position is spelt out in Singapore's legal and constitutional frameworks, which state that the ministry is responsible for internal security, including managing the crisis and its aftermath. In the event of a large-scale attack, the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) can be brought in to support the police as an auxiliary force, tapping its specialised units like the Special Operations Task Force. ""To this end, the police and SAF have developed joint plans and conducted joint exercises,"" he said. The ministry may also get other government agencies and ministries, such as the Health Ministry and the Communications and Information Ministry, to support its operations, he added. Joint exercises will be held, and these are necessary for all parties to sharpen their response plans, said Mr Shanmugam. Mrs Teo said that Singapore must also guard against social fault lines to make it harder for terrorists to carry out attacks, and ""to think twice before they target us"". As a precautionary move, the Government introduced the Public Order and Safety (Special Powers) Bill this week to give the police powers to, among other things, issue an order to stop people, including the media, from communicating information that can compromise police operations. The new Act adds to the arsenal against terrorism, which was reinforced last year when the Infrastructure Protection Act was introduced and changes made to the Public Order Act. In addition, Mrs Teo said, ""every Singaporean has a role to play, and that is why community partnership is a key part of the Home Team's work and also why we launched the SGSecure movement"". Correction note: An earlier version of this report said that the Public Order and Safety (Special Powers) Bill was passed this week, when in fact it was only tabled for the first reading. A stop order under the proposed Act can be placed against all kinds of communication -- photos, text, audio and graphics -- that could compromise police operations. We are sorry for the error."
 EU piles pressure on internet giants to remove extremist content,"related media assets (image or videos) available. Click to see the gallery. 2 related media assets (image or videos) available. Click to see the gallery. Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and other internet companies must show the European Union within three months that they are removing extremist content more rapidly or face legislation forcing them to do so. BRUSSELS: Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and other internet companies must show the European Union within three months that they are removing extremist content more rapidly or face legislation forcing them to do so. Several governments have increased pressure on social media companies to do more to remove illegal content - from material related to groups such as Islamic state and incitement to commit atrocities - and the sector has increased efforts to demonstrate its progress. But in its strongest call yet to the technology sector the European Commission on Thursday recommended measures that internet platforms should take to stop the proliferation of extremist content, including the removal of such material within an hour of being notified of its existence. European governments have said that extremist content on the web has influenced lone-wolf attackers who have killed people in several European cities after being radicalised. ""While several platforms have been removing more illegal content than ever before ... we still need to react faster against terrorist propaganda and other illegal content which is a serious threat to our citizens' security, safety and fundamental rights,"" Digital Commissioner Andrus Ansip said in Thursday's statement. European online trade association EDiMA, whose members include Google, Facebook and Twitter, said it was dismayed the Commission had not first chosen to engage in dialogue. A one-hour turn-around time might also not be workable, it said. The recommendation, which is non-binding but could be taken into account by European courts, sets guidelines on how companies should remove illegal content generally - from copyright infringements to hate speech - and advises a quicker reaction to extremist material. The Commission said it would assess the need for legislation within three months for what it described as ""terrorist content"", given the urgency of the issue. For all other types of illegal content it will assess progress made within six months. It also called on the technology sector, which is dominated by U.S. companies, to adopt proactive measures such as automated detection to rid their platforms of illegal content. Campaign group the Counter Extremism Project said the Commission's proposal was welcome but did not tackle two issues - how to make automated technology widely available and how to stop extremists uploading again content that had been removed. European Digital Rights, a civil rights group, described the Commission's approach as putting internet giants in charge of censoring Europe. Only legislation would ensure democratic scrutiny and judicial review. Luxury groups, meanwhile, welcomed the Commission's move saying action by online platforms is also necessary to fight the sale of counterfeit goods online. ""Proactive measures coupled with good consumer information is the only way to effectively deal with illegal content online,"" said Toni Belloni, group managing director of LVMH."
" Britain is facing serious far-right terrorism threat, says top UK officer","LONDON: Britain faces a new and significant threat from organised far-right terrorism, the UK's most senior counter-terrorism officer said on Monday as he revealed police had foiled four plots by right-wing extremists in the last year. ""The right-wing terrorist threat is more significant and more challenging than perhaps public debate gives it credit for,"" Mark Rowley, London's Assistant Commissioner, told reporters. Britain has been a prime target for homegrown and foreign Islamist militants since the 2001 attacks on the United States. But Rowley said until the last two years, far-right activity was limited to unpleasant protests and hate crimes, with serious incidents limited to the actions of isolated individuals. The MI5 domestic spy agency are now involved in investigating the far-right and he warned that British groups were seeking links with international extremists. ""It's a significant part of the terrorist threat. Right-wing terrorism wasn't previously organised here,"" Rowley said. ""There are many Western countries that have extreme right-wing challenges and in quite a number of those the groups we are worried about here are making connections with them and networking,"" he said, declining to give further details because it was a new, live intelligence phenomenon. Last year, there were five deadly militants attacks in Britain including one carried out by a man who drove a van into worshippers leaving a London mosque after developing a hatred of Muslims by reading extreme right-wing material online. The previous year, a Nazi-obsessed loner murdered lawmaker Jo Cox in a frenzied street attack a week before the referendum on the European Union. Since then, Britain has banned National Action and two other spin-off groups, the first extremist right-wing organisations to be outlawed since the 1940s. ""For the best part of 18 months in the UK we have a homegrown, white supremacist, neo-Nazi terrorist organisation that is pursuing all the ambitions of any other terrorist organisation committed to violence,"" Rowley said. ""That should be a matter of great concern for all of us."" Since the first of the 2017 deadly attacks last March, Rowley said police had foiled 10 Islamist conspiracies and four far-right plots, although he said he could not provide details of these as they were subject to ongoing court cases. To show the overall scale of the threat Britain faced, he said there were 600 terrorism investigations currently ongoing involving more than 3,000 suspects. Over the last three years, terrorism arrests had doubled while in the same period some 2,000 people have been referred to the government's counter-radicalisation Prevent programme, with a third of these over far-right concerns, he said. Rowley, who next month steps down from the role he took on in 2014, said Islamist and far-right extremists were a toxic combination, feeding off each other and pursuing the same agenda of division, fear and hatred. He reiterated British concern about extremists' use of the internet and said he expected technology and internet firms would react to a mixture of persuasion and regulation as the banking sector had done. He also said it was important that an agreement struck with the European Union for when Britain leaves the bloc in 2019 did not damage relations with their European colleagues. ""Whatever the arrangements, we need something that provides at least a good a platform for cooperation as we have today,"" he said."
Amsterdam: ‘Terrorist motive’ alleged in attack on Americans,"By the Associated Press AMSTERDAM — A 19-year-old Afghan citizen had a “terrorist motive” for allegedly stabbing two Americans at the main train station in Amsterdam, city authorities in the Dutch capital said Saturday. Amsterdam police shot and wounded the suspect after the stabbings Friday at Central Station. The local government said hours later it appeared the people injured weren’t targeted for a specific reason, but added that investigators had not ruled out terror as an aim or any other possibilities. After the US ambassador to the Netherlands identified the victims as American tourists Saturday, Amsterdam City Hall gave an update. “Based on the suspect’s first statements, he had a terrorist motive,” the city administration said in a statement that did not elaborate on what the statements were or how they showed intent. The wounded Americans were recovering in a hospital from what police termed serious but not life-threatening injuries. Their identities have not been released. The suspect, who was identified only as Jawed S. in line with privacy rules in the Netherlands, also remained hospitalized. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte confirmed on Twitter that the investigation focused Saturday on exploring the extremist ideas that allegedly inspired the train station attack. The Netherlands’ counter-terror chief, Dick Schoof, tweeted that the country’s threat level would remain at number four on a scale that tops out at five. “Sadly, this reprehensible act fits into the current threat assessment,” he said. W. had a residency permit from Germany. German authorities searched his home and seized data storage devices that would be analyzed as part of the investigation, the city government statement said. He was scheduled to be arraigned during a closed-door hearing with an investigating judge on Monday. Dutch officials did not disclose the charges he could face. A statement issued late Friday by Amsterdam’s city council said the Americans did not appear to have been victims of a targeted attack. Amsterdam authorities also said Friday that it appeared from initial inquiries that the victims weren’t chosen for a clear reason. The local government said Saturday it had no immediate plans to beef up security in the city, saying the swift action by police “shows that Amsterdam is prepared for this kind of incident.” A passerby’s dramatic photo showed two police officers pointing guns at a man in blue jeans and sneakers lying on the ground inside a train station tunnel. Earlier Saturday, the US ambassador to the Netherlands confirmed that the two people injured Friday were Americans visiting the Netherlands when they were stabbed at the station. Ambassador Pete Hoekstra issued a written statement saying US Embassy officials had been in touch with the victims or their families. “We wish them a speedy recovery and are working closely with the City of Amsterdam to provide assistance to them and their families,” Hoekstra said. Central Station is a busy entry and exit point for visitors to Amsterdam, with regular trains linking it to the city’s Schiphol Airport. Friday is one of the busiest days of the week for train travel as tourists arrive for the weekend. The station is patrolled by armed police and other security staff."
"Extremist slain, 3 dead after rampage in southern France","TREBES, France (AP) — A gun-wielding extremist went on a rampage Friday in a quiet corner of southern France, killing three people as he hijacked a car, opened fire on police and took hostages in a supermarket, where panicked shoppers hid in a meat locker or ran through the aisles. After an hours-long standoff, the 25-year-old attacker was slain as elite police forces stormed the market. They were aided by a heroic police officer who had offered himself up in a hostage swap and suffered life-threatening wounds  as a result — one of 16 people injured in the day’s violence. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack near Carcassonne, a medieval city beloved by tourists, and the town of Trebes. It was the deadliest attack in France since Emmanuel Macron became president last May. The officer who volunteered to take the place a female hostage was identified as Col. Arnaud Beltrame. He managed to surreptitiously leave his cellphone on so that police outside could hear what was going on inside the supermarket. Officials said once they heard shots inside the market they decided to storm it. A police official who was not authorized to be publicly identified confirmed the officer’s identity to The Associated Press. Macron said investigators will focus on establishing how the gunman, identified by prosecutors as Moroccan-born Redouane Lakdim, got his weapon, and how he became radicalized. On Friday night, authorities searched a vehicle and a building in central Carcassonne. Lakdim was known to police for petty crime and drug-dealing. But he was also under surveillance and since 2014 was on the so-called “Fiche S” list, a government register of individuals suspected of being radicalized but who have yet to perform acts of terrorism. Despite this, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins there was “no warning sign” that Lakdim would carry out an extremist attack. A woman close to Lakdim was taken into custody over alleged links with a terrorist enterprise, Molins said. He did not identify her. The four-hour drama began at 10:13 a.m. when Lakdim hijacked a car near Carcassonne, killing one person in the car and wounding the other, the prosecutor said. Lakdim then fired six shots at police officers who were on their way back from jogging near Carcassonne, said Yves Lefebvre, secretary general of SGP Police-FO police union. The police were wearing athletic clothes with police insignia. One officer was hit in the shoulder, but the injury was not serious, Lefebvre said. Lakdim then went to a Super U supermarket in nearby Trebes, 60 miles (100 kilometers) southeast of Toulouse, shooting and killing two people in the market and taking an unknown number of hostages. Special police units converged on the scene while authorities blocked roads and urged residents to stay away. He shouted “Allahu akbar! (God is great)” and said he was a “soldier of the Islamic State” as he entered the Super U, where about 50 people were inside, Molins said. “We heard an explosion — well, several explosions,” shopper Christian Guibbert told reporters. “I went to see what was happening and I saw a man lying on the floor and another person, very agitated, who had a gun in one hand and a knife in the other.” Guibbert said he led his wife and sister-in-law and nearby customers into the meat locker. Then he went back to see where the assailant was and called police to describe the situation. “At that moment, he (the gunman) ran after me. Of course I left, I lost him and when I turned around he wasn’t there anymore. I took an emergency door and saw the police arrive,” Guibbert said. Another witness, an employee of the supermarket’s butcher department identified only by his first name, Jacky, told Europe 1 radio he “heard people shouting and a big ‘boom.'” “It was a gunshot,” he said. “Then a second gunshot. After that, my colleagues came toward me saying: ‘Come on Jacky, we need to leave! There’s someone who’s firing shots, he’s shouting “Allahu akbar,” and he’s shot people and he’s shooting at everything.'” He said they left using an emergency exit behind the butcher’s stall and they ran across the courtyard. “We also helped people get out,” he said. During the standoff, Lakdim requested the release of Salah Abdeslam, the sole surviving assailant of the Nov. 13, 2015, attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. The interior minister suggested, however, that Abdeslam’s release wasn’t a key motive for the attack. The IS-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group’s calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition carrying out airstrikes against IS militants in Syria and Iraq since 2014. France has been repeatedly targeted because of its participation. Both Interior Minister Gerard Collomb and Molins praised Beltrame, who Molins said “at the risk of his life took the choice to take the place of the hostages.” The gunman shot Beltrame several times after threatening to blow up the supermarket if police entered, Molins added. BFM television said Beltrame recently took part in a training exercise simulating a terrorist attack. As the supermarket standoff reached a crescendo about 2:20 p.m., police heard gunshots inside the building and decided that elite forces had to storm it. Lakdim was killed and two other officers were wounded during the assault, Collomb said. “He acted alone, there was no one else but him,” he added. Macron rushed back from an EU summit in Brussels to Paris, where counterterrorism investigators took over the investigation. France has been on high alert since a series of extremist attacks in 2015 and 2016 that killed more than 200 people. While France hasn’t had an attack in several months, “the threat remains high,” Macron said, describing ongoing risks from “several individuals who radicalized themselves.” Macron pushed through a tough counterterrorism law last year that gives police extra powers to conduct searches and hold people under house arrest. In Brussels, German Chancellor Angela Merkel appeared with Macron and said, “When it comes to terrorist threats, we stand by France.” Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the Eiffel Tower would turn its lights off at midnight in tribute to the victims. At the national stadium outside Paris, 80,000 soccer fans and the national teams of France and Colombia observed a minute of silence Friday night to honor those killed in the attacks earlier in the day. Poignantly, the stadium itself was the site of bloodshed in the deadly Paris attacks in 2015."
UN experts: Al-Qaeda greater threat than IS in some places,"By the Associated Press Al-Qaeda’s global network remains “remarkably resilient” and poses a greater threat than the Islamic State extremist group in several regions, including Yemen and Somalia, UN experts say. The panel of experts monitoring sanctions against both groups said in a report to the UN Security Council, obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press, that Al-Qaeda affiliates also “remain a threat at least as serious” as IS in West Africa and South Asia. In a separate report circulated Tuesday, UN experts said IS poses “a significant and evolving threat around the world” despite recent setbacks in Iraq, Syria and the southern Philippines that forced the militants to relinquish strongholds. The new report said unidentified UN member states highlighted that some Al-Qaeda and IS members “have been willing and able to support each other in the preparation of attacks,” which poses “a potential new threat” in some regions. “In addition, Al-Qaeda propaganda continues to highlight a new generation of potential leaders, such as Hamza bin Laden … in an apparent attempt to project a younger image to its sympathizers,” the experts said. Bin Laden is the son of Osama bin Laden, who masterminded the Al-Qaeda terrorist attack on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001, that killed nearly 3,000 people and injured over 6,000. He called on Muslims around the world in an audio message in November to avenge his father’s killing in 2011 by US Navy SEALS. In Syria, the experts, said some unnamed governments also highlighted that the Nusra Front “remains one of the strongest and largest Al-Qaeda affiliates globally.” It aims to absorb smaller groups in Syria though some members argue that the Nusra Front should have “a more international outlook” and not concentrate only on Syria, they said. The Nusra Front remains the dominant force in the Al-Qaeda-linked Hay’at Tahrir al Sham coalition — Arabic for Levant Liberation Committee, also known as HTS — with between 7,000 and 11,000 fighters, including several thousand foreigners, the experts said. The group is entrenched and able to make money in its stronghold in Idlib province, they said. But since the report was written, Idlib has come under intense attack by Syrian government forces. According to the assessment of UN member states, the experts said Al-Qaeda also “remains a serious threat within the Arabian peninsula,” plotting attacks in the wider Middle East as well including a July 2017 plot targeting Jordan that was planned in Yemen and disrupted. The experts said Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is playing a leading role in Al-Qaeda’s propaganda and communications activities. In West Africa, the experts said member states highlighted that the threat from groups related to Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State continues to spread through Mali as well as neighboring countries. Over the course of 2017, they said, most “terrorist entities” operating in the Sahel region established formal links with either IS or Al-Qaeda. “However, to date, no rivalry between the various groups has been observed,” the experts said. In East Africa, they said the Al-Qaedaa affiliate al-Shabab “remains resilient and has sustained its dominance” over IS affiliates in Somalia. It also poses a greater threat than IS to the African Union peacekeeping force in the country. “In 2017, al-Shabab pursued its goal of establishing a presence beyond Somalia and conducted operations seeking to set up bases in Kenya, Ethiopia and Djibouti,” the experts said. In Afghanistan, the experts said, unnamed governments highlighted an increase in opposition fighters, estimating there could be as many as 60,000 fighters loyal to the Taliban combined with members of various Al-Qaeda-affiliated groups. There are more than 20 groups active in the country, with the Taliban the largest at about 40,000 to 45,000 fighters, the experts said. In South Asia, Al-Qaeda affiliates and Islamic State extremists are taking advantage of “the volatile security situation in Afghanistan,” the experts said. Islamic State losses in Iraq and Syria also are raising “the threat to Southeast Asia, as its funds and fighters are scattered around the world,” the report said. The region has seen “a marked increase in terrorist attacks” in recent years, with at least 10 IS-inspired attacks in Indonesia alone in the first half of 2017, it said. Since IS lost its strongholds, its propaganda machinery “is further decentralizing and the quality of its material continues to decline,” the experts said. Nonetheless, they added, IS fighters, supporters and sympathizers still use social media, encryption technology and the dark web to communicate with each other “and motivate and facilitate attacks.” IS also continues to move funds across the Middle East using “hawala” money transfer networks and cash couriers, and it is “penetrating legitimate businesses in the region by using seemingly unconnected or ‘clean’ individuals with access to the financial system as fronts,” the report said."
"PM condemns New York City terrorist attack as cowardly act
","KUALA LUMPUR: Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak has labelled the deadly terrorist attack in New York City on Tuesday, in which a man driving a pickup truck mowed down people on a cycle path in Lower Manhattan, as a cowardly attack on humanity. ""My thoughts & prayers for New York City. Innocent lives were lost today. ""We stand together against cowardly attacks on humanity,"" he said in his twitter account today. According to media reports, at least eight people were killed and 11 others seriously injured in the attack. A 29-year-old man from Uzbekistan, believed to be the driver of the truck, was shot by police and taken into custody."
Hero French policeman dies after jihadist shooting spree,"TRÈBES, March 24 — A French policeman who was shot and stabbed after swapping himself for a hostage in a rampage and siege President Emmanuel Macron branded ""an Islamist terrorist attack"" died of his wounds today, becoming the gunman's fourth victim. Lieutenant-Colonel Arnaud Beltrame, 45, was among a group of officers who rushed to the scene in the town of Trebes in southwest France yesterday after the attacker, who claimed allegiance to the Islamic State group, stormed a supermarket and fired at shoppers and staff. Beltrane offered to take the place of a woman the gunman had taken hostage and was shot and badly wounded before anti-terror police moved in to kill the attacker and end the siege. ""Lieutenant-Colonel Arnaud Beltrame has passed away. He died for his country. France will never forget his heroism,"" Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said on his Twitter account. Macron earlier paid tribute to the bravery of the police officer. ""He saved lives and honoured his colleagues and his country,"" Macron said. With the death of the officer, the assailant, identified as 25-year-old Radouane Lakdim, killed a total of four people in France's first major jihadist attack since October. ""Our country has suffered an Islamist terrorist attack,"" Macron said in a televised address following the rampage in the medieval town of Carcassonne and nearby Trebes. The Islamic State group claimed the attack was in response to its call to target Western enemies — as is customary when the assailant has pledged allegiance to the jihadists. The shootings come as France remains on high alert following a string of deadly attacks that have killed more than 240 people since 2015. Top anti-terror prosecutor Francois Molins said the gunman had convictions for carrying a banned weapon and for drug use. ""He had been on a watchlist for his radicalisation and links to the Salafist movement,"" Molins told reporters in Carcassonne, adding that Lakdim had been tracked for his online contacts with extremists. Security sources said Lakdim was born in Taza in northern Morocco and held French nationality. His partner, who lived with him in Carcassonne, has been detained, Molins said. Lakdim started his rampage in Carcassonne at around 10:30am (0930 GMT), hijacking a car and shooting the two people inside, Molins said. The passenger was killed, and the driver remains in a critical condition. Lakdim then shot and wounded a police officer who was out jogging with colleagues before driving to nearby Trebes where he burst into the Super U supermarket. ""The attacker entered the store shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest) and saying he was a soldier of the Islamic State, ready to die for Syria,"" Molins said. He further demanded ""the release of his brothers"" from prison before shooting a supermarket customer and an employee dead. ""I was five metres away from him,"" the store's security guard said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""He shot at me twice."" Luckily for the security guard, ""he shot badly."" About 50 people were in the supermarket at the time, and though some people managed to escape, several remained inside. Beltrame offered to take the place of a woman Lakdim was using as a human shield while his colleagues negotiated with the gunman, the interior minister said. The officer ""left his telephone on the table"" to allow police who had surrounded the building to listen in, Collomb said. When special forces heard shots they stormed the store, killing the gunman and recovering Beltrame, who had been seriously wounded. He was shot twice and stabbed several times by the attacker, a source close to the investigation told AFP. Trebes, a sleepy town of 5,000 people along the Canal du Midi, was on lockdown throughout yesterday as helicopters swirled overhead and heavily armed and masked police carried out a massive operation in Lakdim's neighbourhood. The fact that Lakdim had been monitored as a potential extremist will raise difficult questions for Macron's government as to how he slipped through the net. ""We had monitored him and did not think he had been radicalised,"" Interior Minister Collomb said after flying to the scene. ""He was already under surveillance when he suddenly decided to act."" In Paris, the Eiffel Tower dimmed its lights at midnight in a mark of respect for the victims and a minute's silence was held at the Stade de France before a football match between France and Colombia. Yesterday’s violence took place in a part of France still scarred by a killing spree in 2012 in the city of Toulouse and nearby Montauban where another jihadist, Mohamed Merah, shot dead seven people including three Jewish schoolchildren. That assault marked the first of several big Islamist attacks in France since 2015, including the massacre at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, the November 2015 attacks that killed 130 in Paris, and a summer 2016 truck attack during Bastille Day festivities in Nice. The most recent assault came in October when a Tunisian man stabbed to death two women at Marseille's railway station, shouting ""Allahu Akbar"". A state of emergency put in place just after the 2015 Paris attacks was lifted last October when Macron's centrist government passed a new law boosting the powers of security forces."
 Maldives promises to monitor and block radical websites,"MALÉ, Jan 15 —The Maldives has promised to block websites seeking to radicalise its Muslim population, officials said, as the US warned extremist groups may attack with little warning in the honeymoon islands. Defence Minister Adam Shareef said authorities were monitoring radical websites and social media accounts and would shut down any trying to recruit or influence Maldivians. “We have been noticing some information on websites and open sources that lead to people becoming more radicalised,” Shareef told reporters in Male late Monday. The Maldives had warned of past efforts by foreign extremists to groom its citizens but had refrained from censoring or blocking online material considered risky. Authorities had begun identifying and closely tracking several radical websites in the wake of Shareef’s declaration, said sources close to the matter who wished to remain anonymous. The cyber crackdown came less than a week after the US issued an updated travel warning for visitors to the Indian Ocean archipelago, urging them to exercise increased caution due to terrorism. “Terrorist groups may conduct attacks with little or no warning”, the statement read, including on remote islands where the response time by authorities would be lengthened. The Maldives are popular for tourists seeking surf, pristine beaches and paradise getaways. But the islands have been plagued by political turmoil and nascent fears of Islamic extremism in recent years, denting its image as an upmarket honeymoon destination. There have been no recent attacks targeting tourists in the nation of nearly 1,200 tiny coral islands scattered across the equator. But nearly 60 Maldivians are known to have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight with foreign jihadists, and some are believed to have returned home. Maldives President Abdulla Yameen warned in 2016 that violent Islamic extremism posed one of the biggest threats to the 340,000 Sunni Muslims living on the popular holiday islands."
 Islamic State claims deadly French supermarket siege,"TREBES, March 24 — A gunman claiming allegiance to the Islamic State group killed three people in a shooting spree and supermarket hostage siege in southwest France yesterday before anti-terror police shot him dead. Five people were also shot and wounded in France’s first major jihadist attack since October, including a heroic policeman who offered to take the place of hostages being held at the supermarket. “Our country has suffered an Islamist terrorist attack,” President Emmanuel Macron said in a televised address following the rampage in the medieval town of Carcassonne and nearby Trebes. The Islamic State group claimed the attack was in response to its call to target Western enemies — as is customary when the assailant has pledged allegiance to the jihadists.

Senior officer Arnaud Beltrame, 45, offered to take their place while his colleagues negotiated with Lakdim, Molins said. When the special forces officers heard shots they stormed the store, killing the gunman and recovering Beltrame, who had been “seriously wounded”. Macron led tributes to the police officer, who has been hailed as a hero. “He saved lives and honoured his colleagues and his country,” Macron said. “He is currently fighting for his life and all our thoughts go out to him and his family,” he added. A Portuguese national was among those killed, the government in Lisbon confirmed. Trebes, a tranquil town of 5,000 people along the famed Canal du Midi, was on lockdown throughout Friday as helicopters swirled overhead and heavily armed and masked police carried out a massive operation in Lakdim’s neighbourhood. The fact that Lakdim had been monitored as a potential extremist will raise difficult questions for Macron’s government as to how he slipped through the net. “We had monitored him and did not think he had been radicalised,” Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said of Lakdim after flying to the scene. “He was already under surveillance when he suddenly decided to act.” Friday’s violence took place in a part of France still scarred by a killing spree in 2012 in the city of Toulouse and nearby Montauban where another jihadist, Mohamed Merah, shot dead seven people including three Jewish schoolchildren.

The most recent assault came in October when a Tunisian man stabbed to death two women at Marseille’s railway station, shouting “Allahu Akbar”. A state of emergency put in place just after the 2015 Paris attacks was lifted last October when Macron’s centrist government passed a new law boosting the powers of security forces. Soldiers continue to patrol major tourist sites around France and transport hubs under an anti-terror mission. “We are in a small and calm town, but sadly the threat is everywhere,” Collomb said."
"Singapore arrests, deports self-radicalised Malaysian worker"," SINGAPORE, Feb 9 — A self-radicalised Malaysian who worked for an airfreight company here has been deported after being arrested under the Internal Security Act (ISA) last month, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said today. Muhammad Nur Hanief Abdul Jalil, 33, worked as a driver with the company and had access to the Changi Airfreight Centre, a restricted area. The centre provides airfreight services to Changi Airport. Investigations did not point to Hanief having attempted to radicalise others or planned to launch terrorist attacks in Singapore. “(But) his radicalisation renders him a security threat to Singapore. His work pass was therefore cancelled, and he was repatriated to Malaysia in Feb 2018,” the MHA said in a statement. The ministry said the Malaysian had been going online since 2008 to peruse the teachings by foreign extremist preachers such as Imran Hosein, Zakir Naik and Anjem Choudary. He became convinced that he should travel to Syria or Palestine to take part in the armed conflict, and decided to act on his plan late last year. “He was prepared to join any militant group there”, including the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, MHA added. The Malaysian police have taken Hanief into custody, and he is being detained under the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 (Sosma) for further investigation, TODAY understands. Sosma replaced the repealed Internal Security Act in 2012 and is used by Putrajaya to combat terrorism. Under Sosma, police may detain a suspect for 28 days and withhold legal representation for two days. "
East Asia Summit members to boost security cooperation,"With the world facing renewed anxieties over nuclear warfare and grappling with the threat of cyber attacks and terrorism, Asean nations and eight of their key partners yesterday vowed to step up cooperation in a range of security areas. East Asia Summit (EAS) members agreed to do more to tackle returning foreign fighters, beef up cyber security, and ensure the safe and secure use, storage and transport of nuclear and other radioactive materials. They also said they would press on with efforts on the Asean Smart Cities Network, a flagship deliverable under Singapore's Asean chairmanship this year, and the fight against plastic litter in the oceans. The 18-country EAS - which groups all 10 Asean members plus Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Russia and the United States - released five statements after its meeting yesterday. ""South-east Asia is on the frontline,"" he told his counterparts as he wrapped up their discussion. The region is not just a recruiting ground for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), it is also a target in the extremist group's expansion plans, he added. ISIS, after all, has made clear that it wants to set up a caliphate in South-east Asia. The prolonged siege in Marawi in the Philippines may have ended, but insurgents have regrouped, PM Lee pointed out. And ISIS has been linked to terrorist attacks in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, as well as close to 50 thwarted attack plots - including one against Singapore. ""The region also faces heightened threat of attack from returnee fighters and lone wolves,"" he said. ""Therefore, it is more important than ever for continued cooperation among countries."" Among other things, EAS members pledged to get the public - including young people, women, families, religious leaders and community groups - more involved in efforts to inoculate the community against violent extremism. They also agreed to share information on foreign fighters - including on their movements and financial information - in a timely manner, and do more to stop them from crossing borders. With cyber security under discussion, the EAS members said they were determined to promote secure and resilient information and communications technologies (ICT) infrastructure, noting that this can contribute to regional security and stability. They will work together to promote an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful ICT environment - which is critical to connectivity and economic development - and, recognising that some states may lack the capacity to protect their networks, provide help on issues such as developing technical skills. They also recognised the importance of strengthening cooperation on personal data protection. They said they would address the digital divide and development gap by supporting initiatives such as helping micro, small and medium-sized enterprises make use of these technologies. It is important to ensure the safety and security of nuclear and other radioactive materials, EAS members said. They agreed that nuclear energy and technology could play useful roles in fields such as medicine, agriculture and energy. Acknowledging that all states have the right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, consistent with international law, they pointed out that acts of nuclear terrorism could pose a threat to international peace and security. The members encouraged all states to build a robust domestic nuclear safety and security regime and conduct exercises to prepare their communities for incidents involving radioactive materials. They reaffirmed that non-state actors should be prevented from developing, acquiring, transporting or using nuclear weapons. They also took aim at a problem plaguing the environment: The rise of plastic litter in the oceans, which places marine biodiversity, as well as industries such as fisheries, maritime transport and tourism at risk. More can be done, including in improving the management of plastic waste, promoting research and education on marine plastic debris, and enhancing cooperation in policy reform and law enforcement. EAS members also recognised that developing a regional smart cities ecosystem will help the region weather challenges arising from rapid urbanisation and allow them to ""harvest the opportunities associated with the ongoing digital and fourth industrial revolution"" for better economic, social and environmental outcomes. The Asean Smart Cities Network, they agreed, would help uplift the lives of Asean citizens. ""There is still much more to be done for the EAS to evolve into an anchor platform for maintaining regional peace, stability and prosperity,"" said PM Lee. He added: ""I am confident that with the continued support of participating countries, the EAS will continue to grow from strength to strength, and play an essential role in strengthening our open, inclusive and Asean-centric regional architecture."""
California man pleads guilty to fighting in Syria,"CHICAGO, Nov 1 — A California man who came to the US from Syria as a refugee and later returned there to fight with an extremist group pleaded guilty yesterday to terrorism-related charges. Aws Mohammed Younis al-Jayab, 25, admitted that he flew from Chicago to Turkey in November 2013 and then entered Syria where he joined and fought with Ansar al-Islam, which is designated as a terrorist organization, the Department of Justice said in a statement after the guilty plea in Chicago. Al-Qaeda affiliate Ansar al-Islam (Partisans of Islam) once operated in both Iraq and Syria. Its Iraqi faction later merged with the Islamic State group, though some of its Syrian fighters rejected IS. Jayab faces up to 15 years in prison for his plea to a charge of providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization, and up to eight years for a second guilty plea, providing a false statement to federal agents. When he returned to the United States in January 2014 Jayab did not declare his travel to Turkey and Syria, the Department of Justice said. In a later interview with federal agents he denied supporting terrorist groups. At the time of Jayab’s arrest, US Attorney Benjamin Wagner stressed that “while (Jayab) represented a potential safety threat, there is no indication that he planned any acts of terrorism in this country.” Jayab, an Iraqi-born Palestinian, came to the United States from Syria as a refugee in 2012, US officials said at the time of his arrest. He will be sentenced on April 26 next year."
 AFP continues to gain ground against terrorists," The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Tuesday said it continues to gain ground against communist terrorists and other terrorist groups as recent developments show they are experiencing significant setbacks following the intense military operations conducted by the security forces nationwide. In a statement, the AFP Public Affairs Office said the number of New People’s Army (NPA) regulars and supporters coming back to the folds of the law continue to increase. Just last week, 16 communist terrorists from the NPA, including four women and two child warriors surrendered to the Philippine Army’s 53rd Infantry Battalion in Poblacion, Zamboanga del Sur. On Sunday three members of the Southern Mindanao Regional Command of the NPA voluntarily surrendered to the local chief executives of barangays Lumiad, and Magsaysay, Carmen, Davao del Norte. A certain alias Ramo, vice commander of the Pulang Bagani Command 1, SRC5, SMRC; an alias Marvin/Isak, team leader of Andoy Primera of the same group, and an alias Joa, medic of the same group, all surrendered to the government forces. Upon their debriefing, they gave information that led to the recovery of a CAP2 landmine, a cal .38 revolver, and 400 rounds of ammunition. “Nakikita natin na nawalan na ng suporta galing sa masa ang mga rebeldeng grupo na ito kaya sila ay tuluyan nang nagbalik loob sa gobyerno (We can see that the rebel groups are losing support from the masses that’s why they returned to government fold),” AFP Chief of Staff Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr., said. “Ang mga sumurender ay matataas ang katungkulan sa kanilang organisasyon. Sila na din ang nagsabi na hirap na sila at wala nang nakikitang rason upang lumaban pa sa ating pamahalaan (Those who surrendered have high positions in their organization. They are also the ones who said they are suffering and they don’t see any reason to fight the government),” he added. In a simple ceremony led by the Task Force Balik Loob on September 27, 64 former NPA members were formally welcomed to the society in Nabunturan, Compostela Valley. They have undergone Enhanced Comprehensive Local Integration Program (E-CLIP) for former rebels. Other former rebels in Southern Mindanao were also provided with livelihood and cash benefits in a program held in Nabunturan, Compostela Valley on September 29. “It is not too late for you (NPAs) to surrender and leave your current miseries from fighting a useless cause.” Galvez said. The troops of 90th Infantry Battalion recently foiled a bombing plot of the extremist group, Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters, after acting on a report from a concerned civilian that the BIFF was planning to transport an improvised explosive device (IED). The IED was found inside a passenger jeepney at a checkpoint in Brgy Capiton, Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao Monday morning. A red passenger jeepney traversing the national highway from Ganta, Kabuntalan, North Cotabato was flagged by the military personnel and found the suspected IED. The civilian tipster said Kamsali Taguitikan and Rasol, under Karialan faction of the BIFF, are planning to transport the IED from the marshy area of Brgy Palongoguen in Midsayap, North Cotabato to conduct terror attack in Cotabato City. The elements of 3rd Explosive Ordnance Disposal team of the Army immediately arrived in the area and safely disrupted the IED. Recovered in the scene were one 81mm, one 60mm, two batteries (dry cell), one roll electrical tape, and wires. “I commend all the troops who successfully foiled another terror attack that might have killed innocent civilians. I remind every unit and every soldier, airman, sailor, and marine not to let our guards down against terrorists,” Galvez said. “We will continue to intensify our checkpoints and our operations against all these groups that pose a threat to our communities. I call on every individual to be vigilant and actively involved in reporting any suspicious person or activity in their localities. Only with that degree of vigilance of our people, combined with the unceasing efforts of the government security forces can we as a nation stop these terrorists.” Galvez added."
 Radicalised Singaporean IT engineer detained under Internal Security Act," A radicalised Singaporean engineer, who wanted to travel to Syria to take up arms in support of the terrorist group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), has been detained under the Internal Security Act (ISA). Ahmed Hussein Abdul Kadir Sheik Uduman, 33, was detained last month after investigations showed he was radicalised, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said in a statement yesterday. The information technology (IT) engineer, who had sought religious knowledge online since 2013, was found to be following the lectures of several foreign radical ideologues, said the ministry. They include radical Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, an Al-Qaeda ideologue who was killed in 2011 in a US drone strike in Yemen, and several other clerics who have been arrested or jailed for inciting violence or espousing support for terrorism. Ahmed ""grew to believe that the use of violence in the name of religion was justified"" and by late 2016 was convinced he should fight and die as a martyr for ISIS in the terror group's self-proclaimed caliphate in the Middle East, said the ministry. He maintained regular contact with pro-ISIS foreigners on social media to keep up with the developments overseas and also tried to influence some of his foreign online contacts to follow the violent teachings of the radical ideologues he had been following because he wanted them to support ISIS. Commenting on the detention in a Facebook post, Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Masagos Zulkifli said: ""This new case shows that the threats of self-radicalisation and terrorism remain real...We must stand together to protect our peace and harmony in Singapore."" Mr Masagos, who is Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, also reiterated the Muslim community's firm stance against extremist teachings. He urged people to look out for one another and to refer those who show signs of radicalisation to the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis), Religious Rehabilitation Group or the police. Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu, who noted the Muslim community's efforts in fighting radicalism, said in a Facebook post: ""The actions of the misguided few must not be allowed to define an entire community. We must stand together with our Muslim friends, because every one of us has a role to play in upholding trust among communities in Singapore."" Muis, also weighing in, warned of the dangers of seeking religious knowledge online and called on the Muslim community to turn to credible sources such as religious teachers registered under the Asatizah Recognition Scheme. Meanwhile, a housewife who was radicalised online and had wanted to travel to the Middle East to join ISIS, was released from detention in July after her Order of Detention was suspended, said MHA. Munavar Baig Amina Begam, 39, ""no longer posed an imminent security threat that required her to be placed in preventive detention"", it added. Instead, she has been issued with a Suspension Direction, which requires her to abide by several conditions and restrictions. For example, she is not allowed to change her residence or employment, or travel out of Singapore without the prior approval of the director of the Internal Security Department (ISD). She also cannot issue public statements, address public meetings or print, distribute, contribute to any publication, or hold office in or be a member of any organisation, association or group without the prior approval of the ISD director. Amina, a naturalised citizen from India with two children, was radicalised online and used social media to promote terrorism. She was detained last November for supporting ISIS and harbouring the intention to join the terror group in Syria. MHA had said her husband was not aware of her radicalism."
Duterte orders soldiers: Kill enemies of the state," President Duterte has assured the military of his full support as he ordered soldiers to “destroy and kill” enemies of the state, particularly the Islamic State and al-Qaida terrorist groups. “I assure you that you have my full support as you conduct intensive military operations against these terrorist groups, particularly those who subscribe to the extremist ideologies of the Islamic State and al-Qaida,” the President said in a speech at Camp Teodulfo Bautista atBarangay Bus-bus in Jolo, Sulu. “That’s just a bankrupt, inutile ideology. They only know how to destroy and kill, destroy and kill. So my order to you: Destroy and kill also. Why be at a disadvantage?” he added. President Duterte assured the soldiers that they are not alone in their fight to protect the country. “With your bravery, selflessness and patriotism, I am optimistic that we will one day defeat all threats to our democratic institutions and secure a brighter future for our beloved country,” he said. The President added: “The Filipino people stands beside you, and I stand with you every step of the way as we advance the common good and promote the safety of our nation.” He also reminded them to always keep themselves safe even as they carry out their duties of fighting threats and protecting the country. “Take extra care. Do not be an extraordinary hero. Just take cover for as long as you can… In real life, ensure your safety first, then you kill,” he said, noting that a soldier’s life is harder than what appears in the movies. He also assured soldiers that he would provide for their needs and whatever they ask for in order to survive. “Every time that you need me and everything that you need to survive, I’ll give it,” the President said. President Duterte also commended the Joint Task Force Sulu for its relentless pursuit operations against threat groups such as the Abu Sayyaf. “I therefore commend the Joint Task Force Sulu for your relentless efforts against various threat groups in your area of operations, especially the Abu Sayyaf,” he said."
Gov’t forces nab bomb expert in Maguindanao,"Combined elements of the military and police today arrested a bomb expert and his wife after a predawn raid on a terrorist lair in Maguindanao. The operation also resulted in the death of 15 members of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), wounding of eight others, the destruction of an IED (improvised explosive device) factory of the DAESH-(al-Dawla al-Islamiya fi al-Iraq wa al-Sham, translated as Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) inspired terrorists recovery of a certain number of IEDs. The Army’s 6th Infantry Division led by Brig. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana spearheaded the counterterrorist operations against the Dawlah Islamiyah Toraife Group in the boundary between Pagalungan and General Salipada K. Pendatun. Backed by Philippine Air Force air assets, ground troops of the Army’s 33rd Infantry Battalion led by Lt. Col. Harold M. Cabunoc, 4th Special Action Battalion led by Police Supt. Darwin Padla, and 61st Division Reconnaissance Company led by 1st Lt. Ruel Fortuna, stormed the terrorist lair in the Liguasan marsh. The terrorists traded fires with the 33rd IB troopers but they were outmaneuvered after about an hour of firefight, prompting two terrorists to surrender. Cabunoc identified the duo as Ustadz Anwar Ali, 22, and Asnaya Ali, 20. The soldiers confiscated a Cal 50 Sniper Rifle and s Cal 5.56mm M4 Carbine from the suspects. “The suspects threw their weapons and improvised bombs in the water when we blocked all their escape routes. Ustadz Anwar is known as Abu Omar, a bomb expert in the group,” Cabunoc said. Sobejana has directed his troops to cordon off all escape routes as another group pursues the remnants of the elusive terrorist group. “We will not allow these terrorists to spoil the peace in Central Mindanao. We will protect the people against those who espouse violent extremism,” Sobejana, who is the concurrent Joint Task Force central commander, said. “We ease the fear of our people and assure them that safety procedures were undertaken and deliberately planned by JTFC giving due concern to the safety of the civilian populace,” he added. Sobejana said appropriate coordinations were made with the MILF CCCH and the targeted areas were confined to locations far from the local communities. “I am very determined to defeat these threat groups and prevent them from doing terroristic activities to bring about peace in Central Mindanao. We urge the continued support and cooperation of our people in the communities to hasten the attainment of peace and development,” Sobejana said. “Let us be partners in preventing and countering the efforts of the radical extremist groups in sowing fear and violence. I am calling the community to be vigilant and committed to peace,” he said. The Philippine Army soldiers hoisted the national flag after defeating the terrorists in their remote marshy hideout in the Liguasan Marsh."
Police get wider powers to deal with serious incidents,"A new law that expands police powers to allow officers to respond swiftly and with greater flexibility during serious incidents like a terrorist attack was passed yesterday after a three-hour debate. Under the Public Order and Safety (Special Powers) Act, the police commissioner can impose measures such as a curfew and a stop order on communications to ensure the secrecy of security operations. But the Act may be invoked only with the authorisation of the Home Affairs Minister, Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo said yesterday, following concerns expressed by MPs during the debate on the proposed legislation. Other safeguards are also in place to ensure the police commissioner and the minister exercise their special powers only for specified incidents, where the police are likely to be in a race against time, Mrs Teo added. ""Once the threshold of a serious incident is crossed, we must give the police sufficient latitude to act decisively,"" she told the House on the final day of a three-day sitting. The new law comes in the wake of a ""clear and continuing threat"" of a terror attack facing Singapore, which has been cited as a target in extremist publications and videos. During the debate, Nominated MP Kok Heng Leun, who was among 10 members of the House who spoke on the proposed legislation, expressed concern over the discretion given to the minister and police commissioner. Mr Kok asked if there could be conditions on the use of the special powers, and cited the Internal Security Act, which requires the minister's decision to be concurred by the president on the advice of a special advisory committee. Replying, Mrs Teo stressed that the special powers will not be used for day-to-day policing, but only for specified incidents like a terrorist act or large-scale public disorder. ""Members will have to weigh: Which is the bigger risk in a serious incident? Which has the graver consequence?"" she said. ""There is a risk of too much discretion, but there is also a risk of too much delay."" Mrs Teo also said that after an incident has been dealt with, Parliament can still debate if the minister and police had done the right thing and hold them to account - as was with the 2013 Little India riot. This new law repeals the Public Order (Preservation) Act, which allowed Parliament to annul the minister's proclamation as a safeguard. This will no longer be the case. ""There is no sinister reason for this,"" said Mrs Teo. "" Judicial review of the minister's decision to make an activation order remains an avenue to curb improper use... of his powers."" She noted that the old Act was used only once since independence, and it was after the Little India riot. ""Even then, it was tightly scoped, to control the consumption of alcohol, to calm the situation and prevent further violence,"" she said. Another concern raised is what constitutes reasonable force, during which lethal weapons can be used. Mrs Teo said lethal weapons are used only if the police have no other choice, and cited the Shangri-La Dialogue incident in 2015, in which a car sped through a police checkpoint. Police had to use ""reasonable force"", including lethal weapons, as it was a high-profile event involving foreign dignitaries, and there was a risk the driver was committing a terror act. Almost all the MPs sought clarification on the communications stop order, which can make it an offence to take photos or videos of an incident area when the order is activated. Mrs Teo said: ""Police will exercise discretion and take into consideration the circumstances under which the recorder was in and if the breach could not have been reasonably avoided."""
Indonesia prosecutors demand death for radical leader over 2016 attacks," JAKARTA, May 18 — Indonesian prosecutors this morning demanded the death penalty for a radical cleric over his role in a 2016 terror attack committed by a group linked to wave of suicide bombings this week. Dozens of officers from an elite unit were sent to guard the trial of Aman Abdurrahman who is accused of authorising a gun and suicide attack in the capital Jakarta two years ago that left four attackers and four civilians dead. They were the first attacks claimed by Islamic State in Southeast Asia. Abdurrahman — considered the de facto head of all IS supporters in Indonesia — is also the spiritual leader of local extremist network Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD). Authorities said JAD was behind the 2016 attack and suicide bombings in Indonesia’s second-biggest city Surabaya this week. Two families — including a 9 and 12 year old girl — blew themselves up at churches and a police station, killing 13. Authorities have not charged Abdurrahman, 46, over this week’s attacks. This morning, prosecutors called for Abdurrahman to be executed for the 2016 attacks. “We demand this panel of judges sentence Aman Abdurrahman to death,” lead prosecutor Anita Dewayani, told the South Jakarta district court. Abdurrahman is already in jail on a separate terror conviction. The families who committed the suicide bombings knew each other and belonged to the same religious study group, along with third family linked to the attacks. All had ties to JAD with the father of the church suicide bombers identified as a local leader in the group. "
 Another family behind Indonesia suicide bombings,"SURABAYA—A family of five, including a child, carried out the suicide bombing of a police headquarters in Indonesia’s second city Surabaya on Monday, police said, a day after a deadly wave of attacks on churches staged by another family. The spate of bombings has rocked Indonesia, with the Islamic State group claiming the church attacks and raising fears about its influence in Southeast Asia as its dreams of a Middle Eastern caliphate fizzle. Indonesia has long struggled with Islamist militancy, including the 2002 Bali bombings that killed over 200 people-mostly foreign tourists—in the country’s worst-ever terror attack. Security forces have arrested hundreds of militants during a sustained crackdown that smashed some networks, and most recent attacks have been low-level and targeted domestic security force. But that changed Sunday as a family of six—including two young girls—staged suicide bombings of churches during morning services in the country’s second biggest city Surabaya, killing 14. On Monday, members of another family attacked the police station in Surabaya, wounding 10. “There were five people on two motorbikes. One of them was a little kid,” national police chief Tito Karnavian said. “This is one family.” An eight-year-old girl from the family survived the attack and was taken to hospital, while her mother, father and two brothers died in the blast, he said. The church attacks were claimed by the Islamic State group. The father of the church suicide bombers was a local leader in extremist network Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) which supports IS. “It ordered and gave instructions for its cells to make a move,” Karnavian said of the church attacks. He added that the attacks may have also been motivated by the arrest of JAD leadership, including jailed radical Aman Abdurrahman, and were linked to a deadly prison riot staged by Islamist prisoners at a high-security jail near Jakarta last week. Abdurrahman has been connected to several deadly incidents, including a 2016 gun and suicide attack in the capital Jakarta that left four attackers and four civilians dead.Despite their apparent allegiance to IS, the church-bombing family were not returnees from Syria, police said Monday, correcting their earlier statements. However, hundreds of Indonesians have flocked in recent years to fight alongside IS in its bid to carve out a caliphate ruled by strict Islamic law. Its efforts have been fizzling quickly as it has lost most of the land it once occupied in Iraq and Syria. On Sunday evening, just hours after the church bombings, a further three people in another family were killed and two wounded when another bomb exploded at an apartment complex about 30 kilometers from Surabaya. Police said the father in the church bombings-Dita Oepriyanto?was a confidante of the man killed in the apartment, who police said had a bomb detonator in his hand when he was shot by authorities. “The father was Dita’s close friend,” said Karnavian, the police chief. “When we searched the flat we found pipe bombs, similar to pipe bombs we found near the churches.” Indonesian police have foiled numerous terror plots, but the coordinated nature of Sunday’s church bombings and the subsequent blasts point to more sophisticated planning than in the past, analysts said. “There is definitely a growing technical proficiency,” than in past attacks, said Zachary Abuza, professor and Southeast Asian security expert at the National War College in Washington. “To pull off three near simultaneous bombings is hallmark of a group that is thinking.” Abuza questioned the police suggestion that the attacks were ordered by the IS leadership abroad, but said the group would likely keep up its influence in Southeast Asia as it fades elsewhere. “(They’re) going to continue to benefit from operating transnationally in Southeast Asia,” he added."
Terror group JAD still a threat in Indonesia," JAKARTA • Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), an Indonesian home-grown terror group affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), remains a threat in the country despite recent crackdowns, the latest report by the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (Ipac) has said. The report, issued last Thursday, said the terror group would continue to launch attacks even though law enforcers have been searching for its members across the country following deadly suicide bombings in Surabaya, East Java, in May. ISIS is also known as Islamic State (IS). ""The defeats of the IS in the Middle East have not weakened the determination of IS supporters to wage war at home since they can no longer get to Syria,"" Ipac director Sidney Jones said. Future attacks, the Ipac said, might occur after ""a period of dormancy"" in which surveillance eases and complacency returns. The Ipac predicted that such attacks might occur outside East Java, especially in areas around the West Java-Central Java border, such as West Java's Cirebon and Indramayu, as well as Central Java's Tegal, which was described by the researchers as regions where a ""critical mass of supporters was still active"", showing a high degree of militancy. The areas, the report said, have been producing terrorists since the deadly Thamrin attack in Jakarta in January 2016. Poso in Central Sulawesi also came under the spotlight in the Ipac report, especially after earthquakes and a tsunami hit the province on Sept 28, causing several prisoners to escape, and some of them are still at large. University of Indonesia (UI) terrorist expert Ridwan Habib echoed the sentiment and warned that attacks might come ahead of the 2019 general election. In August, the South Jakarta District Court declared JAD a ""forbidden organisation"" and found it guilty of committing a number of terror acts. The ruling enables the police and their counter-terrorism squad Densus 88 to use newly added provisions in the Terrorism Law to prosecute individuals who intentionally recruit for or join an organisation declared a terror group by the court. The North Sumatra police said last Friday that its personnel killed two suspected terrorists and JAD members during a raid in Tanjung Balai, a day before they allegedly plotted attacks on temples and police stations in the city. The Ipac criticised the police's capability of monitoring people suspected of having a connection with terror groups, saying that ""surveillance of the (Surabaya bombing) perpetrators had stopped about three months before the attacks"". According to the report, JAD Surabaya leader Dita Oepriarto had shown more signs of interaction with neighbours to present an image of ""normal, pious Muslims"" during which he had allegedly been assembling at least 100 pipe bombs. The suspected mastermind behind the suicide bombings in all three churches in Surabaya, he blew himself up in one of the attacks. ""It was this willingness to engage with the community that became one factor in the police's decision to stop surveillance,"" the Ipac said."
" Suspected terrorists planned to rob banks, police say","Five suspected terrorists linked to extremist group Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), who were arrested in Blitar, East Java, allegedly planned to rob several bank branches, National Police spokesman Brig. Gen. Mohamad Iqbal said. “They planned to launch [terror] acts against a number of banks in Blitar as an act of fai [taking infidels’ fortune],” Iqbal said in Jakarta on Thursday. They also allegedly planned to attack a number of government offices. “The police confiscated firearms and bullets,” he said. The suspected terrorists have been identified as AR, MSZ, NH, HW and K. AR is linked to the JAD Blitar chapter while the police are investigating the remaining four’s connection. The five were arrested in different places in Blitar on Wednesday night."
 Indonesian IS-linked militant jailed for seven years," JAKARTA, Feb 12 — The Indonesian leader of an Islamic State-linked militant group was jailed for seven years today over plans to smuggle weapons from the southern Philippines, a court said. Zainal Anshori, 43, head of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, was found guilty of committing a “criminal act of terrorism” by the Jakarta court. His group is believed to be responsible for several terror plots in Indonesia including a January 2016 attack in Jakarta that left eight people dead, including four militants. The cache of some 50 weapons, which did not reach their destination, were intended to be used in future attacks in Indonesia, the court said. Indonesia, the world’s biggest Muslim majority nation, has been on heightened alert following a string of IS-inspired attacks and plots. Many jihadists from Indonesia — which has long struggled with Islamist militancy — have in recent years travelled to join IS in Syria and the Philippine city of Marawi. Foreign and local IS supporters ravaged Marawi before being defeated in October, ending a five-month conflict with the military that left about 1,100 people dead. Last week, a Jakarta court sentenced an Islamist militant to ten years in prison for buying a cache of guns from a rebel group in the Philippines"
Police nab JAD E. Java leader Abu Umar,"The police have captured a man suspected of being the leader of pro-Islamic State (IS) terror group Jamaah Ansharud Daulah’s (JAD) East Java chapter in Malang, following a series of bombings earlier this week in the provincial capital Surabaya. The man has been identified as 37-year-old Syamsul Arif, also known as Abu Umar. The arrest was confirmed by National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian during a live television talk show on Tuesday. “[We have not] only captured the leader of Surabaya’s [JAD] chapter, but we have also arrested the leader of JAD’s East Java chapter in Malang,” Tito said as quoted by tribunnews.com. According to Antara news agency, the confirmation was echoed by East Java Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Frans Barung Mangera on Wednesday, when he said Abu Umar was among the 18 people apprehended by the National Police’s counterterrorism squad Densus 88 between Monday and Tuesday. According to the police, Umar was arrested along with his wife Wahyu Mega Wijayanti in a rented house in Malang early Tuesday morning. However, counterterrorism and radicalism expert Rakyan Adibrata questioned the importance of Abu Umar. Unlike Jamaah Islamiyah (JI), JAD has a loose chain of command, meaning that even if the police arrested one of its leaders, the individual attacks would not stop. “In JAD there is no chain of command; actions can be taken without collective decision-making as in JI,” Rakyan told The Jakarta Post on Thursday. Also due to the loose chain of command in JAD, there will likely be a leadership vacuum in East Java, he said, as the next leader would be decided by prominent JAD ideologue, Aman Abdurrahman, who is currently in detention. Nonetheless, he added, Abu’s arrest would still benefit Indonesia’s counterterrorism efforts. “The arrest will still help [the police] in discovering more JAD networks in East Java and preventing plans for individual terror attacks,” Rakyan said. "
"What is JAD? Terror group behind Mako Brimob riot, Surabaya bombings","Multiple deadly bombings in East Java and the brutal killing of six police officers at the Mobile Brigade headquarters (Mako Brimob) in Depok, West Java, which took place within less than a week have catapulted Jamaah Ansharud Daulah (JAD) into notoriety. JAD, the largest local terror group pledging allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) group, has played a significant role in the terror attacks. ""[The attacks] are connected to JAD, which is the main supporter of ISIS in Indonesia and was founded by Aman Abdurrahman,"" National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian confirmed on Sunday. A family of suicide bombers linked to JAD attacked three churches across Surabaya on Sunday morning, killing at least 12 people and injuring 41 others. Two attempted bombings were reported at two other churches in the East Java capital. Later the same day, another explosion was reported at a low-cost apartment in the neighboring city of Sidoarjo. The latest attack took place on Monday morning, when a bomb exploded at the Surabaya Police headquarters. In total, 25 people, including 13 suicide bombers, were killed and dozens injured in the series of bombings in Surabaya, which resembled the pattern of attacks carried out by the Jamaah Islamiyah (JI) movement at dozens of churches across Indonesia at the start of the millennium. JI is said to have renounced violent jihad, leaving pro-IS group JAD as the most lethal terror group in the archipelago. But what is JAD? And how influential is its founder, Aman? Aman Abdurrahman (center), the alleged mastermind of the Jan. 14, 2016 suicide bombings and gun attacks on Jl. MH Thamrin, Central Jakarta, during a court hearing in South Jakarta District Court on Feb. 15. (kompas.com/Nursita Sari) The Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC) calls JAD ""the largest faction of ISIS supporters in Indonesia,"" consisting of followers of pro-IS ideologue Aman and Jamaah Anshorul Tauhid (JAT) leader Abu Bakar Baasyir. The term JAD, which means ""Partisans of the [Islamic] State Group,"" was previously a generic term referring to anyone who had sworn allegiance to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, but is now specifically used by a group that was formed in Malang in November 2015 and has chosen Aman as its ideological head. Aman was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2004 after a failed terror plot in Depok, West Java, and was released for good behavior in 2008. Soon after his release, Aman collaborated with Ba'asyir to form a joint terrorism training camp in Aceh in 2010 that united the different terrorist groups, leading to another prison sentence of nine years. Despite being behind bars, Aman has been accused of involvement in several other terrorist attacks across Indonesia, including masterminding the deadly Jan. 14, 2016, Thamrin attacks in Central Jakarta. The firebrand cleric, who graduated from the Institute for Islamic and Arabic Studies (LIPIA), was also allegedly involved in the May 25, 2017, bombings in Kampung Melayu, East Jakarta, that killed three policemen. Aman and his followers believe that all security forces of an ansharut thoghut (idolatrous state) should be considered kafir (non-believers), whose property can be seized and blood can be shed. Barbed wire installed at the entrance to the National Police Mobile Brigade headquarters (Mako Brimob) in Depok, West Java, following a riot on Tuesday night. (Warta Kota/Maulana Mahardihka ) After the declaration of the Islamic State by al-Baghdadi at Mosul, Iraq in June 2014, Aman believed that the Hegira, or emigration to Syria, was the obligation of all ISIS supporters. Shortly before the 2016 Thamrin attacks Aman issued a fatwa that was widely circulated among extremist groups: ""Emigrate to the Islamic State and if you cannot emigrate, then wage jihad with spirit wherever you are, and if you cannot wage war or you lack the courage to do so, then contribute your wealth to those who are willing to do so. And if you cannot contribute, then urge others to undertake jihad. And if you cannot do that, then what is the meaning of your loyalty oath [bai’at]?"" The terror inmates who rioted last Tuesday evening at the Mako Brimob detention center reportedly demanded to speak with Aman, who is being held at the facility, during initial negotiations with police officers, a demand that the police later met. The police, Tito said, suspected that the Surabaya bombings were motivated by the police's actions in arresting leaders of JAD. ""They reacted [to the arrests] by carrying out retaliatory attacks, such as that which occurred at Mako Brimob."" The terrorists' decision to launch the attacks in Surabaya, Tito said, may have been related to the recent conviction of the leader of JAD's East Java chapter, Zaenal Anshari, for smuggling weapons to Indonesian militants in the southern Philippines. Zaenal is the second-in-command in JAD after Aman. The incidents in Depok and Surabaya were part of a number of recent terror attacks or attempted attacks allegedly orchestrated by JAD-linked militants. Residents stand next to human body parts at a scene where two bombers launched an attack at Kampung Melayu bus terminal in East Jakarta on May 25, 2017. ADEK BERRY / AFP (AFP/Adek Berry) Since the Thamrin bombings in January 2016, counterterror officials have thwarted numerous attempted attacks by suspects affiliated with JAD in various regions across Indonesia. In January 2017, the US State Department said it had designated JAD as a terrorist group, which in practice prohibits US citizens from being involved with it. The deadly riot at Mako Brimob, which led to a 36-hour standoff between terror inmates and security forces, and the string of bombings in East Java, may have shown that the group has ramped up its capability to launch terror attacks."
Densus 88 officers shoot dead W. Java police shooters," The National Police’s Densus 88 counterterrorism squad shot dead on Monday two individuals who were allegedly involved in the shooting of two police officers on the Kanci-Pejagan toll road near Cirebon, West Java. ""Two suspects, identified by the initials IA and RS, resisted arrest and tried to shoot police officers. Therefore, we took a tough and measured action [to shoot them],” National Police spokesman Insp. Gen. Setyo Wasisto said on Monday as quoted by Antara. RS reportedly was a member of the Cirebon chapter of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), a homegrown terror group that was recently banned. The police suspected it was a revenge attack over the arrest in July of RS’ in-law for alleged involvement with the JAD. In Monday’s operation, two others were arrested on suspicion that they assisted the main suspects during the shooting on Aug. 24. At that time, two traffic officers, First Adj. Insp. Dodon Kusdianto and First Adj. Insp. Widi Harjana, were conducting a routine patrol on the Kanci-Pejagan toll road when they encountered three men sitting on the side of the toll road. The officers, thinking that the men needed assistance, stopped to help but were shot at by one of the suspects as they approached. Dodon died in a hospital several days later, while Widi has shown signs of improvement after being treated. The police also arrested three other suspects on Sunday. ""Several individuals allegedly indirectly involved with the shooting are still at large,” Setyo said. "
Pro-Islamic State hackers threaten terror attacks against Indonesian government," KUALA LUMPUR:  A group claiming to be pro-Islamic State (IS) hackers has threatened to attack the Indonesian government to avenge the “jailing” and “killing” of its “brothers”, a senior counter-terrorism source told Channel NewsAsia on Thursday (Aug 23). The hackers, who call themselves Hacktivist 1435 Anshar Caliphate Army, issued the threat in a video clip which Channel NewsAsia has seen. In the clip, the hackers expressed anger at the government for blocking the social media accounts of pro-IS groups. They vowed to unleash terror on the government in the “real” and “virtual” world. “It has been discovered from the monitoring of covert online social media, sympathisers of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) have posted terror threats from Hacktivist 1435 Anshar Caliphate Army,” the counter-terrorism source told Channel NewsAsia. “The recording was posted on Aug 13.” The one-minute long recording contained only English audio and Bahasa Indonesia subtitles. Calling themselves “the Islamic State hacking division” and addressing the message to the Indonesian government, the group said: “You have oppressed our brothers, jailed, killed and tortured our brothers ... you have done this in the real world.” JAD is the largest pro-Islamic State group in Indonesia and has been blamed for a string of terror attacks in the country, including last May’s suicide bombings on three churches and a police station. The terror group was founded by Aman Abdurrahman, Indonesia’s foremost IS ideologue who was sentenced to death last June for inciting five terror attacks. “You have blocked the social media accounts of my brothers in cyberspace. We will fight and terrorise you in the real world and in cyberspace,” the hackers said in the recording. “We will give out the (government) accounts that we have hacked for our Anshar Khilafah brothers to continue their ... jihad. We will find you and we will kill you. Expect us.” Indonesian police are looking for the person who uploaded the video, according to the counter-terrorism source. AUSTRALIA ISSUES TRAVEL ADVISORY FOR INDONESIA OVER POSSIBLE TERROR THREATS In a message posted on its website on Thursday (Aug 23), Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade warned that terrorists may be planning attacks in Indonesia. “We continue to receive information indicating terrorists may be planning attacks in Indonesia. Due to heightened security concerns, staff at the Australian Consulate-General in Surabaya will not be attending an event at the Airlangga University in Surabaya on 23 August,“ the department said. “Australian officials in Surabaya are currently adopting enhanced security measures and limiting their movements. Exercise a high degree of caution in Indonesia, including Bali and southern Lombok.”"
 Pro-IS cleric Aman declines to appeal death sentence,"Pro-Islamic State (IS) cleric Aman Abdurrahman has instructed his lawyer not to file an appeal against his death sentence for inciting various terror attacks in the country. “It has been seven days since the final hearing, and we have not filed an appeal against the sentence,” lawyer Asludin Hatjani said on Friday, as quoted by kompas.com. Therefore, he said, Aman would be transferred from the detention center at the  National Police’s Mobile Brigade headquarters in Depok, West Java, to another, as yet unspecified, higher-security prison. South Jakarta District Court found Aman, the de facto leader of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), a local affiliate of the IS terrorist group, guilty last week of inciting others to commit at least five terror attacks, including the bomb and gun attack on Jl. MH Thamrin in Central Jakarta in 2016 and the Kampung Melayu bombings in East Jakarta last year. "
Pro-ISIS Indonesian cleric Aman Abdurrahman won't appeal against death sentence," JAKARTA (THE JAKARTA POST/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Radical Indonesian cleric Aman Abdurrahman has instructed his lawyer not to file an appeal against his death sentence for inciting various terror attacks in the country. ""It has been seven days since the final hearing, and we have not filed an appeal against the sentence,"" lawyer Asludin Hatjani said on Friday (June 29), as quoted by the Kompas news website. As such, he said, the pro-ISIS cleric would be transferred from the detention centre at the National Police's Mobile Brigade headquarters in Depok, West Java, to another as yet unspecified higher-security prison. The South Jakarta District Court on June 22 found Aman, the de facto leader of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), guilty of inciting others to commit at least five terror attacks. The JAD is a local affiliate of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terror group. Those attacks included the gun and suicide-bomb attack in Jakarta in 2016 that left four bystanders dead, a church-bombing in Samarinda, East Kalimantan that same year that killed a child, and the Kampung Melayu bombings in east Jakarta last year where three police officers died. The 2016 attack was the first claimed by the ISIS group in South-east Asia. Prosecutors had sought the death sentence for Aman, arguing that although some of the perpetrators of the attacks had never met him, his writings that were made available online had inspired others to launch the attacks."
"Searching for love online, Indonesian maids vulnerable to being recruited by Islamic State: Documentary","KUALA LUMPUR: Indonesian maid Ika Puspitasari was earning good money and, by some account, had a “glamorous life” within her own community while working in Hong Kong in 2016. But the domestic helper, who had previously worked in Malaysia, felt lonely, bored and “empty” with her single status in Hong Kong. Turning to Facebook in search of meaning and companionship, she stumbled upon a news report of a church bombing in Solo, Central Java in 2011 which someone had posted. She started commenting on it. Her comments drew the attention of pro-Islamic State (IS) militants in Indonesia from a group called Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD). They contacted her and soon she was invited into JAD’s Telegram channel. From then on, they had her in their thrall. She started donating money to their cause. She later married an Indonesian IS member online and agreed to be a suicide bomber. “In the Indonesian diaspora there is a cluster of people who are agreeble to become suicide bombers,” said Indonesian counter-terrorism expert and documentary film-maker Noor Huda Ismail. Huda is also the founder of the Institute for International Peace Building, a non-governmental organisation established in January 2008 in response to threat of terrorism. Ika is featured in Huda’s latest documentary called Pengantin, which means bride. The word bride is a codeword for “suicide bombers’ in Indonesian jihadi language. The documentary also features another female suicide bomber, Dian Yulia Nova, 32, who was jailed for seven years for plotting to blow herself up outside Jakarta’s presidential palace during the changing of the guard in 2016. Dian worked as a maid first in Singapore and later in Taiwan. It was in Taiwan that she became radicalised online and later married a pro-IS militant who turned her into a suicide bomber. Her husband was also responsible for recruiting Ika. “There are many cases of maids falling in love online, including those working in Hong Kong. Many of them get conned. By coincidence, those who con them are terrorists,” said Huda. “I want to highlight here that we have a problem,” said Huda. “It (documentary) is a simple story about three women searching for love on social media. Two of them ended up with problematic men while the third was successful in marrying a decent man,” said Huda. “I made this film for these women (migrant women), to warn them that whatever they read and encounter on social media, please verify it. Don’t believe everything you read online,” said Huda. According to the World Bank, Indonesia has 6.5 million migrants workers, 78 per cent of them women. Indonesian maids working overseas, especially in developed societies like Hong Kong, are vulnerable to recruitment by Islamic State as they are seen as potential sources of “funds”  as they enjoy good salaries and have a steady income flow. “One of the important messages in the film is that, since they (maids) have money, they have to be careful,” said Huda. “Money provides independence, self-confidence, but it also provides possible risks because they will be seen and approached by irresponsible men who offer love and protection,” said Huda. “They (militants) just want to use them, especially their money. Marriage is one of the ways to gain control (of the women).“ But the numbers are not large. An estimated 45 out of 150,000 Indonesian domestic helpers in Hong Kong are involved in pro-Islamic State (IS) activities, from funding air tickets to Syria to marrying militant fighters online, according to a 2017 report by the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC). Fuelling the women’s vulnerability to men offering them so-called love and marriage is the Indonesian culture where marriage is seen as a status symbol for women. “For Indonesian women, marriage provides for them not only a partner but social status,” said Huda. INDONESIAN SUB-CULTURE VIEWS RELIGIOUS MEN AS BEING OF HIGH STATUS Living in secular societies like Hong Kong, where the culture and way of life is vastly different to that of Indonesia, renders a sense of dislocation on an Indonesian maid. This sense of dislocation often times propel them to turn to social media to seek religion as a refuge for their loneliness and sense of emptiness. “For many of these women, they usually turn to religion for comfort when they encounter social problem,” said Huda. “And the first place they turn to is social media. These women usually have a shallow knowledge of Islam ... they fall for IS propaganda.” According to Huda, the Indonesian sub-culture where a religious man is seen as a man of high status, it is easy to win their trust. “If you are a religious man, can quote the Koran and hadiths, all of a sudden people will assume you are someone who deserves respect,” said Huda. “The jihadists portray themselves this way ... they put a spell on the girl.” The IS campaign is very effective because they use a simplistic cultural approach, according to Huda. “They tell the girls - the secular system has failed you, corruption is rampant, there is poverty. Our political alternative is the Islamic Caliphate which has been declared. Why don’t you try this new system. That's how they approach the women,” said Huda. To counter IS propaganda, there is a need to include a cultural approach, he suggested. “That is the purpose of my film. I just show the film, to raise awareness, not to lecture anyone,” said Huda. Bahrum Naim, a leading Indonesian IS figure, is behind the man believed to be behind the recruitment of the female suicide bombers, according to Huda. Rizka Nurul, a research officer at Huda’s institute, appears in the film. According to Rizka, apart from money, Indonesian maids are also targeted by IS because they are seen to be “brave.” “It takes courage for these women to leave their villages to travel to a foreign country to work,” said Rizka. According to Rizka, IS recruiters need women who have courage in order for them to carry out a suicide bombing mission. Asked whether the women who are both jailed for wanting to be suicide bomber regret their action, she said no.” In fact, they seem rather proud of what they had done. They are still radical,” said Rizka."
Pro-IS cleric gets death for inspiring terror attacks in Indonesia,"JAKARTA — The South Jakarta District Court has found Friday Aman Abdurrahman guilty of inciting several terror attacks in Indonesia and sentenced the radical cleric to death. “The defendant has been found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of inciting others to commit terrorism,” presiding judge Akhmad Jaini read in the verdict. Aman, the de facto leader of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), a local affiliate of the Islamic State (IS) terror group, had been found responsible for inciting others to commit at least five terror attacks in Indonesia, including the Thamrin shootings and suicide bombings in 2016 on Jl. MH Thamrin in Central Jakarta and the Kampung Melayu bombings in East Jakarta last year. The panel of five judges found his teachings were behind the terror attacks. Aman denied that he was involved in the attack, despite admitting that he had urged his followers to go to Syria to join the IS in its quest to establish a global caliphate. He denounced in his defense plea the recent terror attacks in Indonesia, saying the perpetrators were ignorant and mentally ill. The judges dismissed Aman’s claim, saying based on witnesses’ testimony he had instructed his followers to create chaos and panic in Indonesia as mandated by IS leader Al-Baghdadi."

Suspected terrorist shot dead in Pamanukan for resisting arrest,"Personnel of the National Police’s Densus 88 counterterrorism squad shot dead on Friday a suspected terrorist who allegedly resisted arrest under the Jl. E. Tirtapraja overpass in Pamanukan, Subang regency, West Java. West Java Police chief Insp. Gen. Agung Budi Maryoto said the police had to shoot the suspected terrorist as he attempted to resist arrest. “He brought a backpack suspected to contain a bomb, including its switch,” said Agung, before he attended the West Java gubernatorial candidate debate at Sudirman Grand Ballroom in Bandung, West Java, on Friday evening. He said the police were investigating further terror attack plans that were allegedly going to be conducted by the suspected terrorist, identified only as M, his initial. When he was asked on whether the terror plans were aimed at disrupting the simultaneous regional head elections slated for June 27, Agung said: “We are still investigating such a possibility.” Agung said the police had obtained identities and other information related to the man. He said the police had been tracing him since he first moved from his home in Indramayu, West Java. “He is from Haurgeulis-branch Jamaah Ansharut Daulah [JAD],” said Agung, referring to a local affiliate of the Islamic State [IS] terror group. He said the police had taken the suspected terrorist’s body to Jakarta, including evidence confiscated during the raid. Agung said the police and Indonesian Military (TNI) personnel would carry out joint patrols in areas across Indonesia to ensure the simultaneous regional elections run safely and smoothly."
 Civil group deplores death sentence of terrorist Aman Abdurrahman,"Jakarta-based rights group Community Legal Aid Institute (LBH Masyarakat) has slammed the South Jakarta District Court’s decision to sentence terrorist Aman Abdurrahman to death. The spiritual leader of the Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) terrorist group was declared guilty on Friday for inciting acts of terror. “LBH Masyarakat rejects capital punishment against any crime,” LBH Masyarakat director Ricky Gunawan said in a press statement. He said LBH Masyarakat acknowledged that the attacks committed by Aman Abdurrahman’s terror network were heinous and had taken many lives. “However, the death penalty is not a proper response or answer to [preventing] terror attacks in Indonesia,” Ricky said. Combatting terrorism, Ricky said, required a long-term and holistic approach instead of a reactionary response such as capital punishment. “The death sentence is a delusional solution to terrorism,” the activist said. He pointed to convicted terrorists Amrozi, Imam Samudra and Mukhlas, who were placed in front of the firing squad in 2008, whose execution did not lead to a decline in terrorist activities. LBH Masyarakat recommended that Aman be sentenced to life under continual deradicalization. Aman received the death penalty for violating the 2003 Terrorism Law by orchestrating five terror attacks around Indonesia from 2016 to 2017. Aman founded JAD in February 2015 by uniting Islamic State (IS) sympathizers in Nusakambangan prison as he was serving his nine-year sentence. He is also known as an IS propagandist who actively translates and disseminates IS documents online while indoctrinating fellow prisoners. "
Police arrest 110 terror suspects after surabaya bombings,"Bogor, W Java, (ANTARA News) - A total of 110 terror suspects have, so far, been arrested following the recent bombings in Surabaya, the Police stated here on Friday. ""Five were arrested in East Java, with a gun being confiscated. Arrests were also made in Central Java. They are all linked to (the bombing incidents in) Surabaya.

The Police`s anti-terror squad Densus 88 arrested six terror suspects in Blitar and Tlungagung, East Java, on Wednesday and Thursday. ""All the 110 suspects are linked. I would not as yet disclose anything about it. We will do it later,"" Karnavian remarked. He said five of the six people arrested in East Java were believed to have attacked a police precinct in Talun and a bank in Blitar. ""We continue to work while the people are enjoying a holiday. It is also the peak of our security operations. Ensuring security is our religious service, he emphasized. Karnavian stated that the police had found notes during a search conducted at three locations and several items, including a gun, with eight bullets, and books on "" jihad,"" or the holy war, and radicalism were retrieved as evidence. The police had earlier arrested Syamsul Arifin from Jatinom Village, Blitar. Arifin is the East Java chief of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah. Arifin, also known as Abu Umar, alias AU, was arrested in early May 2018 in connection with the bombings in Surabaya. A series of suicide bombings committed by three families in Surabaya and Sidoarjo killed 13 perpetrators and 14 civilians as well as injured 42 others on May 13-14."
Suspected terrorists plan to attack police offices and banks,"Blitar (ANTARA News) - Suspected terrorists arrested by police in the district of Blitar, East Java, on Wednesday (June 13) planned to attack police headquarters and banks, police said on Thursday. The police special anti terrorist squad (Densus) 88 arrested five suspected terrorist in the district of Blitar on Wednesday. Blitar district police chief Adj. Sr Com. Anissullah M.

"Surabaya attack: Teen suicide bomber seen crying inconsolably before bombings, says witness"," SURABAYA: It was still dark when 16-year-old Firman Halim performed his dawn prayers at a mosque near his home in the leafy, middle-class suburb of Rungkut, Surabaya, Indonesia’s second largest city. The bright, happy child was a favourite of the housing complex security guard, 46-year-old Hery, who regarded Firman as his “little brother.” But last Sunday (May 13), something was amiss. The familiar smile was missing. Instead, the teenager was crying. His father, Dita Oepriarto, 46, stroked his head and patted his shoulders but he kept on crying. Hery had come to the mosque to pray before he started his morning shift and he sat close to them. In the stillness of dawn, Hery, overheard his father whispering “be patient, be sincere” but the teenager could not be consoled. He continued crying. “I wanted to ask his father what was the matter but I stopped myself, as I didn’t want to be seen as interfering in people’s affairs,” said Hery. When the prayers ended, Firman, his father and older brother, Yusof Fadhil, 18, got up to make their way home. At that point, Firman saw his friend and for the first time, he neither acknowledged nor smiled at Hery. Firman later climbed onto the back of a motorcycle and his older brother Yusof drove towards the Santa Maria Catholic church. At the entrance, a churchgoer named Aloysius Bayu tried to stop them. A loud blast went off  at 7.30am local time. The two brothers, Aloysius and five other church members were killed. Five minutes later, their father drove a bomb-laden car to the Surabaya Centre Pentecostal Church at 7.35am local time and detonated explosives. Shortly after that, his wife, Puji Kuswati, 42 and her two daughters, Fadhila Sari, 12 and Famela Rizqita, nine, carried out a bomb attack on Diponegoro Indonesian Christian Church. Within 10 minutes, the entire family of six were dead. The suicide bombings at three churches killed 13 people and wounded another 41. HE DID NOT WANT TO DIE A SUICIDE BOMBER: FIRMAN’S FRIEND Back at his home, Hery heard the news. He was stunned. He immediately thought he understood why Firman was crying – he did not  want to die. “I feel, I believe, he didn’t want to do it (die as a suicide bomber). This is not right, to drag children into this,” said Hery, falling silent as he put his head down. The day ended, but not the terror. Later that night at 9.20pm local time, a bomb assembled by Anton Febrianto exploded prematurely in his home in Sidoarjo, just outside of Surabaya. It killed his wife Puspitasari and one child, Hilta Aulia Rahman, 17. Three other children, Ainur Rahman, Faisa Putri and Garida Huda Akbar, respectively aged 15, 11 and 10, survived. On May 14, a family of five, riding on two separate motorcycles, attacked a police station in Surabaya, killing four members of the family. An eight-year-old child survived. All three families knew each other, according to Indonesian police chief Tito Karnavian. Indonesian police said Dita was the head of the Surabaya branch of the pro-Islamic State (IS) Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD). JAD was founded by Aman Abdurrahman, 46, who is Indonesia’s foremost IS ideologue. He is currently on trial for his role in the 2016 Thamrin terror attack in Jakarta. The horror of two families dying as suicide bombers raises the question - how Dita came to be radicalised to a twisted point that he was willing to lead his four children to death? A senior counter-terrorism official told Channel NewsAsia that Dita was an avid follower of Aman Abdurrahman. “He visited Aman several times in prison and has long followed his sermons,” said the official. When asked where did Dita get the idea to turn his children into suicide bombers, the official said: “We don’t know yet but they (Dita and his friends) very often watched suicide bombings carried out by children."" The official added: “As the leader of JAD Surabaya, Dita could have influenced the other two families."" While Indonesian police chief Tito has officially said that Dita and his family did not go to Syria, the actual situation is far more complicated. “We can’t really tell whether he (Dita) went to Syria or not as we have experienced instances where someone went to Syria and slipped back home undetected,” a security source told Channel NewsAsia. Official figures show there are 1,200 returnees from Syria and many of them are not detained owing to the weakness in Indonesia’s anti-terrorism law 15/2003 which does not cover terror acts committed outside of Indonesia. ""Officially, the figure shows 1,200 returnees from Syria. But unofficially, it numbers at least 2,000 or more,” the source said. ""This is a dilemma facing the country."" FAMILY OF SUICIDE BOMBERS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND Indonesian senior counter-terrorism officials and analysts told Channel NewsAsia the suicide bombings comprising an entire family was unprecedented and warned it could spawn similar copy cat bombings. “This family of suicide bombings can be copied by others not only in Indonesia but the rest of the world,” said the senior counter-terrorism official. “I don’t mean to be an alarmist but this (family suicide bombings) is very dangerous to the whole of Southeast Asia and the world. “We are seeing a community that is fine with killing their own kids,” said Huda, who is also a documentary film-maker. According to Huda, children aged 13 have little understanding on what’s going on while those aged above 13 have the ability to comprehend. “Having said that, in a patriarchal society like Indonesia, it is very difficult for a child to escape a father's influence. These children were very helpless,” said Huda. “In this case, it is very clear the father, Dita, is very radical and his wife was influenced by him to go along with him with his suicide bombings. This makes the child very helpless as there is no one to protect them,” said Huda. On Thursday, five days after the blast at Saint Maria Catholic church, the acrid smell of burnt flesh still hung in the air even as life returned to the church and the street that bore witness to the grisly attack. Santa Maria’s parish priest Father Kurdo Irianto was shocked when he learnt that the bombers included two teenagers. “They (teenaged suicide brothers) are victims too. I am not angry,” said Father Kurdo. Father Kurdo exhorted his congregation to forgive the perpetrators. “Forgive the perpetrators ... they are also victims. We need to forgive in order to rebuild a new life. Forgiveness is also the cornerstone of the Catholic faith,” he said. All around the city, banners saying “We are not afraid” flutters in the air in a show of solidarity. Yet taxi drivers were complaining the number of passengers they picked up had fallen since the bombings. “The malls are empty. There are very few people coming out hence the roads are not as jammed as usual. I am really angry and sad at the same time,” said taxi driver Agus before driving into the night."
Tangerang calls for residents to be vigilant amid terror threats," The Tangerang administration has ordered district heads, subdistrict heads and community and neighborhood unit heads to intensify their monitoring following the arrest of three men suspected of being members of a terrorist group in Tangerang, Banten, on Wednesday. The acting mayor of Tangerang, M. Yusuf, said residents should report suspicious figures to law enforcement officials. He added the administration would launch “Operasi Yustisi” to control the in-flow of newcomers into the city. “We want to limit the movements of terrorists who may be newcomers in the area,” Yusuf said on Thursday, as reported by tempo.co. Tangerang administration spokesman Felix Mulyawan said the residents should be involved in the effort to prevent the dissemination of radical teachings in local neighborhoods. “At the least, residents could be more aware of their surroundings and follow the mandatory reporting for newcomers,” Felix said. The National Police’s Densus 88 counterterrorism squad conducted raids on Wednesday on locations on Jl. Gempol and Jl. Kunciran Indah in Pinang, Tangerang, which are located 1 kilometer apart. They arrested three men identified as MC, G and A, on suspicions they were part of a terrorist group and also detained a woman as a witness. National Police spokesperson Insp. Gen. Setyo Waseso alleged the group was part of the Jakarta network of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), a local affiliate of the Islamic State (IS) group."
"Alleged Tangerang terrorist always neat and well behaved, say neighbors","Muhammad Choir, 32, the man the National Police’s Densus 88 counterterrorism squad arrested on Wednesday for his alleged involvement in a terror group, always looked neat and relaxed in public, a neighbor has said. The neighbor, who identified herself only as Vera, said that Muhammad often took a morning walk around their neighborhood on Jl. Gempol Raya, Tangerang, wearing a T-shirt and shorts. It was only on Friday that Muhammad, who had a thin beard, wore a loose tunic or gamis. According to the tempo.co report, Vera said she knew Muhammad as a tailor who made school uniforms, sports attire and Islamic dress. “He received a lot of orders, especially for early childhood school [PAUD] uniforms. His customers were mostly women,” Vera said on Wednesday as quoted by tempo.co. Another neighbor, Midah, 43, said Muhammad was a nice neighbor that he called “Om Choir”, or ""Uncle Choir"". “When he went back to his hometown in Medan, he bought me coffee as a gift. When he went to Sukabumi, Om Choir brought me mochi,” she said. Sukabumi is the hometown of Choir’s wife, whom he married three months ago. Choir lived in a rental house for about a year, paying annual rent of about Rp 10 million (US$710.64). Choir only had one employee, identified only as G, who was nicknamed Ujang and also arrested on Wednesday. “I don’t know their real names. I called them Om Choir, Ujang and Teteh (a common Sundanese title meaning ""elder sister"") for [Choir’s] wife,” said Midah. On Wednesday, Densus 88 personnel raided several locations on Jl. Gempol in Pinang and on Jl. Kunciran Indah, which is located about 1 kilometer from Jl. Gempol. They arrested Muhammad, G and another man identified as A who were allegedly involved in a terrorist group. Muhammad’s wife was also detained as a witness. National Police spokesperson Insp. Gen. Setyo Waseso said they suspected the group was part of the Jakarta branch of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), a local group that has pledged allegiance to Islamic State (IS)."
"Riau Police attackers IS-supporters, but not JAD: Police"," Four of the men involved in the attack on the Riau Police headquarters in Pekanbaru on Wednesday had previously tried to help terror detainees who were rioting at the Mobile Brigade headquarters (Mako Brimob) last week , police said. ""Six men traveled from Sumatra to help the Mako Brimob rioters, but then went back because the situation had been defused,"" National Police spokesperson Insp. Gen. Setyo Wasisto said on Wednesday. ""Two of them were caught in South Sumatra, while the remaining four went to Pekanbaru to carry out the attack, which we successfully stopped."" Setyo confirmed the identity of three of the attackers: Mursalim, 42, Suwardi, 28, and Adi Sufiyan, 26, all of whom were residents of Dumai, Riau. ""They were part of the Islamic State of Indonesia (NII) network in Riau, which is part of the ISIS network in Indonesia,"" he said. Although NII is separate from the Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) group that was behind the bombings in Surabaya and Sidoarjo, Setyo said they were all part of the wider pro-Islamic State (IS) network in Indonesia. ""They all pledged allegiance to [IS leader] Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,"" he said."
"Destroy and kill terrorists, Duterte orders military","President Rodrigo Duterte has ordered the military to “destroy and kill” the extremist and terrorist groups in the country and assured them of his full support. “I assure you that you have my full support as you conduct intensive military operations against these terrorist groups, particularly those who subscribe to the extremist ideologies of the Islamic State and Al Qaida,” Duterte said Saturday in his speech in Jolo. “That’s just a bankrupt, a useless ideology,” Duterte told soldiers in Camp Teodulfo Bautista.  “They only know how to kill and destroy. Destroy and kill. So my order to you: Destroy and kill also. Why would you want to be at a disadvantage?”  Duterte acknowledged the presence of the soldiers as they honored the sacrifices of the 22 troopers who were wounded in an encounter in Patikul. “We are grateful for your heroism and I will personally ensure that you will be taken care of as you recover from your injuries,” said Duterte, adding he would take care of their families. “I said to give my fullest attention and all the things you need, from the time you enter the service up to the time [you finish it], I have plans already.” Duterte said he believed that the troops remained determined to carry on with their mission despite the challenges they faced. “Every time you need me and everything that you need to survive, I will provide,” Duterte said.He ordered the soldiers to end their lives when cornered. “I’m the only President who gave sidearms because the warfare here is really terrible,” he said. “Do not give in that they will take your arms alive. If you get cornered and you run out of bullets, do not surrender. They will only bring you to their camp, treat you like a dog, bring you in front of a camera and then slit your throat. “This I tell you: Don’t let yourselves be treated like pigs. My soldiers are courageous and ready to die. So, when you run out of bullets, take the last magazine and eat it instead.” Duterte said he would do the same, and that if his airplane crashed into enemy territory he would not be caught alive.  He thanked the soldiers for their dedication, resilience, and support. “With your bravery, selflessness and patriotism, I am optimistic that we will one day defeat all threats to our democratic institutions and secure a brighter future for our beloved country,” he said."
UN advisor a target living as a 'terrorist'," VICKY Tauli-Corpuz has spent four decades campaigning for indigenous people in her native Philippines, but never feared for her life. That changed last month when she was branded a “terrorist” by President Rodrigo Duterte’s administration. The special advisor to the UN on indigenous rights since 2014 was among 600 people accused of terrorism over their alleged links to Maoist rebels in a government document filed in a Manila court in February. The activist, who had condemned alleged rights abuses in the southern Mindanao region where the state is battling an Islamic insurgency and leftist guerrillas, denies the allegations and says she feels like a marked woman. “This is like a target list basically,” the slightly built, bespectacled 65-year-old from the Kankanaey Igorot ethnic group said in an interview at the UN cultural body Unesco in Paris. While waiting to see if the state brings charges, she said she has decided to stay out of the Philippines on the advice of her lawyers. Tauli-Corpuz is one of several left-wing activists accused by Duterte’s government of links to the communist rebels with whom he broke off talks last year, after initially saying he would “walk the extra mile” for peace. Duterte blamed the rebels, whose insurgency has claimed an estimated 30,000 lives since 1969, for ongoing attacks on the security forces. In its court petition, the Justice department asked for the Communist Party of the Philippines and its armed wing, the New People’s Army, to be declared “terrorist organizations.” Attached to the submission were 600 names of suspected rebels, including Tauli-Corpuz and two other prominent indigenous leaders—Joan Carling and Jose Molintas—who have previously advised the United Nations. The targeting of the trio came after Duterte last year accused indigenous Lumad schools of grooming children to become insurgents and threatened to bomb them. Reacting to the case, UN rights chief Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein said it was “unacceptable for a special rapporteur acting on behalf of the international community whose expertise is sought by the [UN]Human Rights Council to be treated in this way.” New York-based Human Rights Watch said those on the “virtual government hit list” were “at grave risk.” Tauli-Corpuz, who began campaigning for indigenous rights in her native Cordillera region during the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, compared the government list to the lists of suspects used to prosecute Duterte’s deadly anti-drugs war. Police say they have killed more than 4,000 drug suspects who resisted arrest, but rights groups estimate there have been more than three times that, including people murdered by vigilante groups.“The President has his police and his death squads who can easily kill people whom they accuse of being terrorists,” Tauli-Corpuz said. The activist who helped draft the seminal 2007 UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples said she believed she was targeted over her condemnation in December of alleged rights abuses in Mindanao, where Duterte is battling pro-Islamic State gunmen. “They [indigenous people] are being displaced, they are being killed, their lands are being taken over, so I made a statement. which came out in the newspapers and the government immediately came out and said I was embarrassing the government internationally,” she said. Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano has insisted there is evidence linking Tauli-Corpuz to the rebels and said she and others on the list “should see this as an opportunity to clear their names.” Duterte, who enjoys wide popularity despite his rights record, has repeatedly lashed out at his domestic and foreign critics. Last week, he announced he was pulling the Philippines out of the International Criminal Court, which is examining his crackdown on drugs. He also recently vowed not to cooperate with the UN special rapporteur on extra-judicial killings, Agnes Callamard. “You’re investigating us, fact finding? Well sorry, do not fuck with me,” he said, in remarks aimed at Callamard. In a statement released to the press, former lawmaker and journalist Satur Ocampo dismissed as “defective and baseless” the government’s bid to declare him a terrorist. In a motion filed before the Regional Trial Court of Manila Branch 19, lawyers for Ocampo asked that the Justice Department petition be dismissed. “In the case of Satur Ocampo, the bases for his inclusion in the list are affidavits executed in 2006. The DOJ merely recycled the affidavits that they used unsuccessfully against him in the rebellion case during the time of President [Gloria] Arroyo. In any case, the affidavits pertain to incidents before the passage of the Human Security Act. This violates a very basic rule that we all learned in our first year in law school: that laws shall have prospective application,” a lawyer for Ocampo said. Also on Friday, the environmental organization Greenpeace called for the court to junk the government’s list that seeks to label 600 individuals as terrorists, saying that the move is careless and puts the lives of innocent people in grave danger. “We are gravely alarmed over such moves that target, harass, and criminalize individuals and organizations that legitimately work to protect human rights, including those who seek to protect our rights to enjoy the blessings of nature, to a stable climate and to a healthy environment,” said Yeb Saño, executive director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia. “The tagging of activists and environmental and human rights defenders is being used by those in power to make sure that the exploitation of the people and of our environment goes on unabated.”"
Funerals next week for Belgian policewomen killed by terrorist,"BRUSSELS (AFP) - The funerals of two murdered police women will be held next Tuesday (June 5) in Belgium's eastern city of Liege where a suspected terrorist killed them and a student, officials said. Funeral ceremonies will be held at 10:00 am (0800 GMT) for Lucile Garcia and Soraya Belkacemi, who will be cremated shortly afterward among family and friends, city officials said. Garcia, 54, had recently become a grandmother, while Soraya Belkacemi, 44, was a mother to 13-year-old twins. Cyril Vangriecken, 22, shot dead in the passenger seat of a parked car, will be buried on Monday, city police spokeswoman Jadranka Lozina told AFP without elaborating. His bowls club will organise a march in his honour on Sunday, Lozinka said. The Islamic State group claimed one of its ""soldiers"" killed the three people, the jihadists' Amaq propaganda agency said. ISIS said ""he led the attack in response to calls to target the countries of the US-led international coalition,"" which is fighting the jihadist group mainly in Syria. Belgian investigators said the attacker identified as Benjamin Herman repeatedly stabbed the policewomen in Liege on Tuesday before using their own firearms to kill them. The 31-year-old then shot dead a student sitting in a parked car in the centre of the industrial city, before entering a nearby school where he briefly took a female cleaner hostage. In a separate investigation, police also suspect that Herman had killed a drug dealer just hours after getting temporary release from prison on Monday morning. Belgian police have identified Herman as a drifter who spent a decade in and out of prison for acts of violence and petty crimes. Prosecutors said his method of attack was a known ""modus operandi"" of ISIS, which claimed deadly attacks in Brussels in 2016. Amateur footage obtained by AFP showed the gunman shouting ""Allahu akbar"" (Arabic for ""God is greatest"") as he walked through the streets during the rampage."
 London attack accused hoped to kill Corbyn,"LONDON, Jan 31 — A man accused of deliberately driving a van into a group of London Muslims told his trial yesterday that he wanted to kill the British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn. Darren Osborne said killing the leftist Labour leader would have been “one less terrorist off our streets”, while killing Labour London Mayor Sadiq Khan as well “would have been like winning the lottery”. Osborne is accused of murdering 51-year-old Makram Ali and trying to kill others in the Finsbury Park area of north London on June 19 last year, after growing angry at recent terror attacks and child sexual exploitation scandals involving gangs of mainly Muslim men, the trial has heard. Osborne, 48, from the Welsh capital Cardiff, denies the charges. He is accused of deliberately driving a van at a group of Muslims who had been attending Ramadan prayers at local mosques. Taking the stand at Woolwich Crown Court in southeast London, Osborne claimed he had plotted with two men called Terry Jones and Dave to “plough through as many” people as possible at a pro-Palestinian march. Corbyn was believed to be attending the central London event but was not there, and road closures meant there was no way for the vehicle to get close to marchers, Osborne said. Prosecutor Jonathan Rees asked him: “Were you hoping that you would have an opportunity to attack Jeremy Corbyn and kill him?” Osborne replied: “Oh yeah”, adding: “It would be one less terrorist off our streets. “If Sadiq Khan had been there it would have been even better. It would have been like winning the lottery.” Osborne claimed that at the time of the collision in the Finsbury Park area, Dave was driving, and carried out the “spontaneous” attack. Both prosecutor and defendant agreed it was “remarkable” that Dave had managed to escape the scene of the attack. Rees said Dave and Terry were “totally fabricated” by Osborne in order to deflect responsibility away from himself. In his opening statement, Rees told jurors that Osborne was “obsessed” with Muslims and deliberately drove into a group near a mosque in what amounted to an act of terrorism. At its opening on January 22, the trial was set to last two weeks."

"Terror suspect killed in fresh gunfire in Indonesia's Surabaya, 4 arrested in anti-terror ops","JAKARTA/SURABAYA (XINHUA, THE JAKARTA POST/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - A terror suspect was killed in a gunfire exchange with the Indonesian police anti-terror squad during crackdown operations following after a series of suicide bomb attacks in the city of Surabaya on Tuesday (May 15). ""A fire exchange has occurred, claiming one life aged between 39 and 41,"" Frans Barung Mangera, the spokesman for the police headquarters in East Java province, where Surabaya is located, said. Further details on the terror suspect would be released after an examination by the police's Disaster Victim Identification Unit was done, Frans said. The gunfire was part of a series of anti-terror crackdown operations in the aftermath of the attacks which took place on three churches and a police station Sunday and Monday in Surabaya. At least five explosions occurred in Surabaya and Sidoarjo on Sunday and Monday, killing a total of 25 people, including 13 suicide bombers, who were members of three families. The bombings marked a new terror surge in Indonesia as attackers are now operated by an entire family, including even children. Meanwhile the police's Densus 88 counter-terrorism squad arrested another four suspected terrorists in different cities in East Java during Monday night operations, police said on Tuesday. Two suspected terrorists were arrested in Malang regency, one in Pandaan and one in Surabaya, Frans told a press conference. Police have not released the names of the newly arrested suspected terrorists but said they were connected to the perpetrators in the Surabaya attacks, including the family of Dita Oeprianto, who blew themselves up at three churches in the provincial capital on Sunday. The police announced on Monday they arrested nine terrorists in different places following the Surabaya attacks. ""That means we have arrested a total of 13 people so far and (the number is likely) to increase. They are not including those who were shot dead,"" Frans said. East Java police chief Machfud Arifin said in the morning that individuals that were being hunted down included radical preachers in the religious gatherings frequented by the suicide bombing families. National police chief Tito Karnavian previously said the perpetrators of the attacks were connected to Jamaah Ansharud Daulah (JAD), a local terrorist group affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria militant group."
Seven killed in IS attack on bus carrying Egyptian Christians," MINYA (Egypt), Nov 3 ? Gunmen attacked a bus carrying Coptic Christians in central Egypt yesterday, killing seven in the latest assault on the religious minority claimed by the Islamic State group. The attackers opened fire on the bus of pilgrims in Minya province after the occupants had visited the Saint Samuel monastery, the local bishop told AFP. Bishop Makarios of Minya said the wounded were taken to a hospital in Beni Mazar, around 200 kilometres (120 miles) south of Cairo. The Coptic Church in a statement released the names of the seven “martyrs” ? including two women ? who died in the attack. Heavy deployments of security forces blocked roads leading towards the scene of the shooting, an AFP reporter said. A security source confirmed that seven people were killed in the attack and said seven were wounded. The Islamic State group claimed the attack in a message via its propaganda agency Amaq. “Those who carried out the ambush... in Minya are fighters of the Islamic State,” it said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app. Egyptian state television said security forces were on Friday afternoon still in pursuit of the attackers. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi observed a minute of silence at a youth forum he was attending and called Coptic Pope Tawadros II to offer his condolences. “I am mourning with deep sadness the martyrs who fell today at the hands of traitors who are trying to harm the tightly-knit fabric of the nation,” the president said in a statement released on Twitter. “I wish the wounded a quick recovery and confirm our determination to continue our efforts to fight the darkness of terrorism and pursue the criminals.” Egypt's prosecutors office said it had received reports of “gunfire targeting a bus carrying a group of Copts returning from the Monastery of Saint Samuel the Confessor”. The health minister and minister of social solidarity were dispatched by Sisi to Minya. Copts, a Christian minority that make up 10 percent of Egypt's 96 million people, have in recent years been repeatedly targeted by the Islamic State jihadist group. IS killed more than 40 people in twin church bombings in April 2017 and a month later shot dead 28 Christians in Minya province. Egypt's government imposed a three-month countrywide state of emergency after the April 2017 church bombings. In December 2017 an IS gunman killed nine people in an attack on a church in a south Cairo suburb. A year earlier, an IS suicide bomber killed almost 30 worshippers at a church in Cairo located in the Saint Mark's Cathedral complex, the seat of the Coptic papacy. The Egyptian army launched a major offensive in February 2018 against IS in the Sinai Peninsula, where the group has waged a deadly insurgency since the fall of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013. Alongside attacks against Copts, the jihadists have killed hundreds of soldiers and policemen in Egypt in recent years and were allegedly behind a November 2017 attack against a mosque in north Sinai that killed more than 300 people. The military offensive ? Dubbed “Sinai 2018” ? has killed more than 450 jihadists, according to an army estimate, while around 30 Egyptian soldiers have been killed during this year's operation. Egyptian authorities have also convicted jihadists for their role in attacks against Copts. Last month an Egyptian military court sentenced 17 people to death over the suicide attacks against churches in 2016 and 2017. Copts have long complained of discrimination in Egypt and IS is not the only group to have launched sectarian attacks against the community. In December 2017, hundreds of Muslims attacked a church south of Cairo that had been operating without a permit for more than a dozen years."
"Gunmen attack headquarters of Libya's state oil firm, two staff killed","related media assets (image or videos) available. Click to see the gallery. 7 related media assets (image or videos) available. Click to see the gallery. Several armed men attacked the headquarters of Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) in the capital Tripoli on Monday, killing at least two staff members, a security official said. TRIPOLI: Several armed men attacked the headquarters of Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) in the capital Tripoli on Monday, killing at least two staff members, a security official said. In the first attack of its kind against the top managers of Libya's state oil industry, two of the gunmen were also killed and at least 10 NOC staff wounded, officials said. Security forces said they had regained control of the landmark glass-fronted building in the centre of the city. The attack came less than a week after a fragile truce halted fierce clashes between rival armed groups in Tripoli, the latest eruption of violence in Libya, which has been in turmoil since a 2011 uprising toppled Muammar Gaddafi. Armed groups regularly block oilfields to make demands but the NOC headquarters had so far been spared the violence. The NOC provides the vast bulk of Libya's state income and, along with the Tripoli-based central bank, is one of the only state institutions still functioning well amid chaos. No group immediately claimed responsibility for Monday's attack. But the interior ministry said in a statement initial indications showed the gunmen belonged to Islamic State, which has previously carried out attacks in Tripoli and other Libyan towns and cities. Gunfire rang out in the morning as security forces allied to the Tripoli-based government arrived. ""The death toll so far is two killed from NOC staff and two attackers,"" said Ahmad Ben Salim, spokesman for the Special Deterrence Force (Rada), one of the most powerful factions in Tripoli. Security forces smashed windows so staff could escape and several people were hurt by shattered glass, witnesses said. NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla and his office manager were seen safely leaving the building. Libya has been divided between rival governments and military factions based in the east and west of the country since 2014, causing political deadlock and an economic crisis. However, the NOC has continued to function relatively normally across Libya, which relies on oil exports for most of its income. Oil production has been hit by attacks on oil facilities and blockades, though last year it partially recovered to around one million barrels per day. Islamist militants have sleeper cells in northern cities as well as mobile units in Libya's southern desert, according to Libyan and Western officials. In May, Islamic State claimed responsibility for a deadly attack on the national election commission offices in Tripoli. The group also claimed an attack in 2015 on the Corinthia hotel, a landmark location in Tripoli. The NOC attack came a day after the United Nations said major armed factions had agreed to freeze their positions to extend the ceasefire."
"At least 6 dead as blasts, gunfire rock Afghan city"," JALALABAD, Afghanistan (AFP) - At least six civilians were killed when militants detonated bombs and stormed a government building on Sunday (May 13) in an ongoing assault in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad, officials said. There were two explosions near the city's directorate of finance, the Nangarhar provincial governor's spokesman Attaullah Khogyani told AFP, adding that ""a number of attackers"" had entered the building. ""Security forces are in the area chasing and fighting them,"" he said. ""So far six civilians (have been) killed and 33 wounded. One attacker is also down. The clearing operation is ongoing."" Earlier, health department officials in the city said hospitals had received at least four dead bodies and 20 wounded people. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. Jalalabad is the capital of restive Nangarhar, which borders Pakistan. Some areas of the province are a stronghold of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group but Taleban fighters are also active there. It was the latest deadly violence to strike Afghanistan as militant groups step up attacks and US-backed Afghan forces intensify air strikes and ground offensives. The assault comes days after suicide bombers and gunmen launched apparently coordinated attacks on two Kabul police stations on Wednesday, killing at least 10 people. April saw a series of attacks across the country targeting voter registration centres as the country gears up for long-delayed legislative elections due in October. The Taleban and ISIS have made clear their intentions to disrupt the elections. Officials are concerned that a low voter turnout will undermine the credibility of the poll. The Taleban recently launched their annual spring offensive, in an apparent rejection of a peace talks overture by the Afghan government. Their Operation Al Khandaq will target US forces and ""their intelligence agents"" as well as their ""internal supporters"", a Taleban statement said on April 25. But the ISIS group has also stepped up its attacks in recent months, particularly in Kabul. Nine journalists, including AFP's chief photographer in Kabul Shah Marai, were among the 25 people killed in a double suicide blast claimed by ISIS in the capital on April 30. Kabul has become one of the deadliest places in the country for civilians as security forces struggle to keep the militants at bay following the withdrawal of Nato combat forces at the end of 2014."
"Car bombs in Yemen’s Aden kill 6, wound dozens","SANAA, Yemen — Two car bomb explosions killed at least six people and wounded 43 others including civilians on Saturday in Yemen’s southern city of Aden, security officials and witnesses said, in an attack later claimed by the extremist Islamic State group. The explosions targeted the site of an anti-terrorism military camp with detention facilities for suspected militants, the officials said, adding that those killed included three civilians and three security personnel. They said that the casualties were taken to hospitals for treatment. The Islamic State’s statement, carried by its Aamaq news agency, said two suicide bomb attacks had struck the anti-terrorism camp in Aden. “The explosions terrified dozens of families living in the area who rushed to the street to look for their children,” eyewitness Gamal Mahdi told The Associated Press. He added that the explosions resulted in multiple causalities, including civilians, and were followed by heavy gunfire. Ali al-Saya, a member of the separatist Southern Transitional Council, told the Associated Press that one of the explosions targeted an office at the STC, which is also the residence of Aden’s former governor Aidrous al-Zubaidi. The office is situated close to the anti-terrorism camp. Al-Zubaidi was not present when the bomb went off. Other witnesses said that militants tried to storm the camp before the explosion but failed. Photos surfaced following the explosion showing the charred vehicles and clouds of heavy smoke hovering over the area."
At least seven killed in suicide attack on Kabul commemorations,"KABUL, Sept 9 — A suicide bomber on a motorbike blew himself up near a convoy of gunmen commemorating the death anniversary of a famed resistance leader in Kabul today, killing at least seven people, officials said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the latest deadly attack in the Afghan capital that comes days after a double bombing at a wrestling club killed at least 26 people. At least seven people were killed and 24 wounded in the explosion, the interior ministry said in a statement. All the casualties were civilians. The force of the blast shattered windows and shook nearby buildings. Among the dead was the driver of a car taking part in the commemorations. He veered off the road and into the front of a shop when the blast happened, witnesses told AFP. Two of his passengers were wounded, they said. Afghan security forces said earlier they had shot dead a man who had been planning to blow himself up near supporters of Ahmad Shah Massoud. The Tajik commander led resistance to the Soviet occupation in the 1980s and to the 1996-2001 Taliban regime. The attack came as convoys of gun-wielding men terrorised Kabul as they commemorated the 17th anniversary of Massoud’s death. Massoud was killed two days before the 9/11 attacks in New York and Washington that precipitated the US-led invasion of Afghanistan. Dozens of cars and pickups carrying men armed with heavy weapons and waving flags drove around the city, blaring loud sirens. AFP journalists heard frequent bursts of gunfire. At least 13 people were wounded by falling bullets and taken to hospital, health ministry spokesman Waheed Majroh told journalists. Police arrested 110 people and seized 20 cars and 10 weapons, the interior ministry said, as part of a crackdown on the violent commemorations. Elsewhere, nearly 20 members of the Afghan security forces were killed in fighting overnight, adding to the hundreds of people killed in recent weeks. Ten police officers were killed and eight wounded during an hours-long gunbattle with Taliban fighters in Wardak province, near Kabul, provincial governor spokesman Abdul Rahman Mangal told AFP. “Air strikes were called in and over 50 Taliban fighters were killed” in the fighting in Daimirdad district, Mangal added. On the other side of the country, Taliban fighters attacked a checkpoint in Obe district in Herat province, killing nine members of the security forces, provincial governor spokesman Jailani Farhad told AFP. Five others were wounded in the attack that ended when government-backed reinforcements were sent to the scene, Farhad said, adding that 15 insurgents were killed. The bloodshed comes amid a flurry of diplomatic efforts to convince the Taliban, Afghanistan’s largest militant group, to agree to negotiate an end to the war. The smaller but potent Islamic State (IS) group is not part of the process, with the United States vowing to annihilate its fighters in Afghanistan. But today’s blatant lawlessness in the capital and the limited response from security forces further undermined confidence in authorities. In a firestorm of angry posts on social media, war-weary Afghans expressed their frustration with the constant violence and the government’s inability to protect civilians. “Why do people have to endure this every year on Sept 9th? Why is the #Afghan govt allowing this?” one social media user posted on Twitter. “Where is rule of law?” tweeted another. A double bombing at a wrestling club in a heavily Shiah neighbourhood on Wednesday killed at least 26 people, including two journalists, and wounded 91. IS claimed responsibility for the attack. The extremist group considers Shiah Muslims apostates and has ramped up attacks against the minority community in recent years. The last major IS-claimed attack on Shiahs in Kabul was on August 15 when a suicide bomber blew himself up in an education centre, killing dozens of students."
Two dead in militant attack on Afghan government office," JALALABAD, July 11 — Gunmen stormed an education department compound in Afghanistan’s restive east today and were battling security forces in an ongoing attack that has left at least two people dead, officials said. Five others have been wounded in the second attack in Jalalabad city in as many days and a number of employees were trapped inside the building, Nangarhar provincial governor spokesman Attaullah Khogyani told AFP. Security forces were trying to clear the militants from the compound and rescue the workers. It was not clear how many gunmen or employees were inside. A security guard employed by the department was among the dead, Khogyani said. Jalalabad health director Najibullah Kamawal confirmed five wounded people had been brought to hospital so far. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the raid. Nangarhar’s provincial capital has seen an uptick in violence in recent weeks, with the Islamic State group claiming most of the attacks. Yesterday, a suicide attack in the city killed at least 12 people and ignited a nearby petrol station, with witnesses describing screaming victims “swallowed” by flames. The bomber was targeting Afghan security forces when he blew himself up. Ten civilians were among the dead. IS claimed that attack via its Amaq propaganda agency. The group has claimed a series of high-casualty suicide bomb attacks in the province in recent weeks, as US and Afghan forces continue offensive operations against the group. While the Taliban is Afghanistan’s largest militant group, IS has a relatively small but potent presence, mainly in the north and east of the country. Today’s attack comes a day after President Ashraf Ghani flew to Brussels to attend a Nato summit where he will be hoping to get a greater commitment from members to the nearly 17-year conflict. Currently, there are about 14,000 US troops in Afghanistan, providing the main component of the Nato mission there to support and train local forces. The attack also coincides with the start of a university entrance exam for more than 16,000 students in Jalalabad, but it was not clear if the two events were linked. The attack comes exactly a month after militants raided the education department in the city. In that incident a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance to the department, triggering a fierce battle between gunmen and security forces. At least 10 people were wounded after terrified employees jumped out of the windows. A recent ceasefire between Afghan security forces and the Taliban during the Islamic holiday Eid had raised hopes that an end to hostilities in the war-weary country was possible. Since then, however, the Taliban has returned to the battlefield and IS, which was not involved in the truce, has continued to carry out deadly attacks. Nangarhar borders Pakistan, which has been under growing US pressure to crack down on extremist groups operating in the country. Pakistan has long been accused of supporting the Afghan Taliban and providing safe haven to its leaders, charges Islamabad denies. Pakistan, in return, has accused Afghanistan of sheltering the Pakistani Taliban."
Belgium mourns victims of bloody Liege attack,"LIEGE, May 31 — Belgium yesterday paid emotional tribute to two policewomen and a student shot dead in the eastern city of Liege as investigators probed the gunman’s transition from years of petty criminality to “terrorist murder”. Prosecutors confirmed they were treating Tuesday’s bloodshed as an act of terrorism, saying the shooter Benjamin Herman was also suspected of another murder the night before. The Islamic State group claimed one of its “soldiers” was behind the attack, the jihadists’ Amaq propaganda agency said yesterday. Across Belgium, flags were flying at half-mast as Prime Minister Charles Michel led a minute’s silence in Liege where around 1,000 people had gathered to pay their respects, among them many police officers. Belgium’s national football squad also halted a training session ahead of next month’s World Cup to observe a minute’s silence for the victims. As police scrambled to unpick the gunman’s motive for the attack, a dramatic account emerged of Tuesday’s bloodshed, which began when the 31-year-old attacked two policewomen with a knife. After repeatedly stabbing the policewomen, he grabbed their weapons and killed them in a modus operandi which has been encouraged online by extremists from the Islamic State group. The two victims were identified as Lucile Garcia, 54, who had recently become a grandmother, and Soraya Belkacemi, 44, a mother to 13-year-old twins. He then shot dead a 22-year-old student sitting in a parked car in the city centre before entering a nearby school where he briefly took a female cleaner hostage. Speaking to the Derniere Heure newspaper, the cleaner, who gave her name only as Darifa, said he had asked her whether she was Muslim and if she was fasting for Ramadan. When she answered “yes” to both questions, Herman said he would not harm her. She then urged him to give himself up, telling him: “You shouldn’t be here, this is a school, there are children!” after which he burst out for his final confrontation with police. Investigators are trying to understand how Herman, a drifter who spent a decade in and out of prison for violence and drug offences, came to carry out such a bloody attack. “The facts are qualified as terrorist murder and attempted terrorist murder,” prosecutors’ spokesman Eric Van Der Sypt told a news briefing in Brussels. He pointed to the fact that “the perpetrator shouted several times ‘Allahu akbar’... and information from state security according to which the perpetrator was in touch with radicalised persons.” But he said information about Herman’s contacts with extremists dated “from late 2016, early 2017” and had not been confirmed since. Amateur footage obtained by AFP showed the gunman shouting Allahu akbar — “God is greatest” — as he walked through the streets. In another video, Herman darts out of the school before a short and intense burst of police gunfire, after which he collapses on the ground. “There are signals that there was radicalisation in the prison but did this radicalisation lead to these actions? There, too, we can ask ourselves a lot of questions,” he told RTL radio. Investigators are also examining whether Herman acted alone or had accomplices. Investigators are paying special attention to the gruesome killing of an alleged heroin dealer linked to Herman who was battered to death with a hammer late Monday in a village near the Luxembourg border. They found the hammer in Herman’s car on Tuesday. Jambon said police believed he had carried out the killing just hours after getting temporary release from prison on Monday morning. Liege, a major city in Belgium’s blighted industrial rustbelt, was the scene of another bloody shootout in 2011 when another former convict killed six people and wounded more than 120 before turning the gun on himself. Belgium has been on alert since January 2015 when authorities smashed a terror cell near Liege that was planning an attack on police. That cells had links to Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the mastermind of the November 2015 attacks on Paris that killed 130 people and was claimed by IS. "
Egypt court puts government critic on terror list,"CAIRO, Feb 21 — An Egyptian court yesterday put a leading government critic and 15 others on terror lists at the request of the public prosecutor, a judicial official said. Abdel Moneim Abul Fotouh, who is accused of joining an illegally formed group and spreading false news in Egypt that could harm its interests, is to remain on the list for five years, the official said. He was arrested on Wednesday after joining a call to boycott next month’s presidential election, which incumbent Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is expected win easily after most rivals were sidelined or withdrew. The identity of the 15 others put on the terror lists were unknown. On Thursday, prosecutors ordered Abul Fotouh be remanded for 15 days over alleged links to exiled members of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. The interior ministry accused Abul Fotouh, a former leading member of the Brotherhood and candidate in the 2012 presidential election, of having been in contact with the group’s members in exile “to sow trouble and instability”. Abul Fotouh was detained shortly after he arrived from London where he gave interviews in which he was critical of the Egyptian government. Sisi was elected in 2014, a year after the former army chief ousted his Islamist predecessor Muhammad Mursi. Abul Fotouh had supported mass protests against the Islamist that prompted the military to topple him. He has since been critical of Sisi who has been accused of clamping down on dissent."
Anger in Nigeria over Boko Haram ‘abduction’ response,"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Feb 23 — Anger erupted in a town in remote northeast Nigeria yesterday after officials fumbled to account for scores of schoolgirls who locals say have been kidnapped by Boko Haram jihadists — a disappearance reviving traumatic memories of the abducted Chibok schoolgirls. Police said on Wednesday that 111 girls from the state-run boarding school in Dapchi, in Yobe state, were unaccounted for following a jihadist raid on Monday night. Hours later, Abdullahi Bego, spokesman for Yobe state governor Ibrahim Gaidam, said “some of the girls” had been rescued by troops “from the terrorists who abducted them”. But on a visit to Dapchi yesterday, Gaidam appeared to question whether there had been any abduction. “The girls scattered during the attack, and we can’t be sure whether they were lost or taken,” he said. “We have no certainty that these boys (Boko Haram) took these girls. “Nobody saw these girls being taken in vehicles. It is possible some of the girls came across motorists and they gave them a ride to some places.” As news of his comments spread, groups of angry youths set up barricades and burned car tyres in the streets, hurling missiles at the governor’s convoy. Bego’s statement had been the first official acknowledgement of an abduction, two days after Boko Haram fighters stormed the remote town in pick-up trucks and a lorry. The disappearance sparked fears of a repeat of the 2014 mass kidnapping of more than 200 girls from a similar school in Chibok, in neighbouring Borno state. Initially, the students in Dapchi were reported to have fled with their teachers at the sound of gunfire. Families claimed the authorities tried to cover up the abduction. A federal government delegation spent less than an hour on the ground at the school meeting Gaidam and military commanders before leaving by helicopter. Information Minister Lai Mohammed made no direct comment on Gaidam’s remarks, but said some students “have phoned from their hiding places... (and) other locations”. He told reporters: “As things develop we will let you know. But we cannot categorically say, ‘x number of girls have been abducted’. But we can say that not all have returned.” Inuwa Mohammed, whose 16-year-old daughter, Falmata, was missing, said he was “devastated by this twist of events” and that his wife fainted on hearing the news and was in hospital. “I woke up with the strong hope of meeting my daughter and my wife had been making preparations for a warm welcome, only for us to receive this shattering news that all along the story has been a rumour,” he added. The attack will again raise questions about the government’s grip on security in remote northeast Nigeria, after nearly nine years of fighting and at least 20,000 deaths. US State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Boko Haram’s “choice of targets including schools, markets and places of worship reflect the brutality of terror organizations.” Residents said fighters dressed in military fatigues and turbans arrived unchallenged, firing weapons and shouting “Allahu Akbar” (“God is greatest”). Safai Maimagani, a herbal medicine vendor, said the militants headed towards the school on the edge of the sleepy farming community. When they returned, “I heard shrieks of girls from the lorry,” he said. Muhammad Kabo, a tea seller, gave a similar account: “They were here for less than an hour. I heard girls wailing in the truck and it was clear that they abducted some girls from the school.” A school security guard who gave his name as Baa-Koro said the gunmen tried to stop the girls from fleeing and tricked them into believing they had come to rescue them. “Some of the girls believed them and climbed up into the lorry. Many others just kept running,” he added. President Muhammadu Buhari was elected in 2015 on a promise to defeat the Islamic State group affiliate and has repeatedly maintained they are now a spent force. But civilians — especially those displaced by the conflict — remain vulnerable to suicide attacks and hit-and-run raids. The Dapchi attack also calls into question how far pledges to improve security at schools have been implemented nearly four years after the Chibok abduction. Since May last year, 107 of the 219 held since 2014 have either escaped or been released as part of a government-brokered deal. Security analysts suggested government ransom payments to secure the release of the Chibok girls could have given the under-pressure group an incentive for financing. "
Gunmen kill 12 Revolutionary Guards in attack on Iran military parade,"DUBAI, Sept 22 ? Gunmen fired on a military parade in southwestern Iran today, killing 12 members of the Revolutionary Guards, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported, in one of the worst attacks ever on the elite force. State television said the assault, which wounded more than 60 people, targeted a stand where Iranian officials had gathered to watch an annual event marking the start of the Islamic Republic’s 1980-88 war with Iraq. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) have been the sword and shield of Shi’ite clerical rule since Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. The Guards also play a major role in Iran’s regional interests in countries such as Iraq, Syria and Yemen. A video distributed to Iranian media showed soldiers crawling on the ground as gunfire blazed in their direction. One soldier picked up a gun and got to his feet as women and children fled for their lives. Ali Hosein Hoseinzadeh, deputy governor in Khuzestan province, was quoted as saying the death toll was expected to rise. One of those killed was a journalist. The bloodshed struck a blow to security in Opec oil producer Iran, which has been relatively stable compared with neighbouring Arab countries that have grappled with upheaval since the 2011 uprisings across the Middle East. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack in the city of Ahvaz. State television blamed “takfiri elements”, a reference to Sunni Muslim militants, for the attack. Ahvaz is in the centre of Khuzestan province, where there have been sporadic protests by the Arab minority in predominantly Shi’ite Iran. Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif said the assault was the handiwork of “regional terror sponsors”, language that usually refers to Iran’s enemies Saudi Arabia and Israel, and “their US masters”. He vowed Tehran would respond decisively. ISNA said an unnamed spokesman for the Revolutionary Guards blamed Arab nationalists backed by Saudi Arabia for the attack. The Revolutionary Guards are the most powerful and heavily armed military force in the Islamic Republic and also have a vast stake worth billions of dollars in the economy. Kurdish militants killed 10 Revolutionary Guards in an attack on an IRGC post on the Iraqi border in July, Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency reported, the latest bloodshed in an area where armed Kurdish opposition groups are active. Iran will be scrambling to determine the motives for today’s high-profile attack as it faces growing US pressure. President Donald Trump decided in May to pull the United States out of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Tehran and reimpose sanctions in a bid to isolate the Islamic Republic. ‘Where Did They Come From?’ A video on state television’s website showed confused soldiers at the scene of the attack. Standing in front of the stand, one asked: “Where did they come from?” Another responded: “From behind us.” Four militants carried out the attack and two of them were killed, according to ISNA. There has been no claim of responsibility for the attack in the city of Ahvaz. Iran was holding similar parades in several cities including the capital Tehran and the port of Bandar Abbas on the Gulf. “Shooting began by several gunmen from behind the stand during the parade. There are several killed and injured,” a correspondent told state television. Tensions between mainly Shi’ite Iran and mostly Sunni Saudi Arabia have surged in recent years, with the two countries supporting opposite sides in wars in Syria and Yemen and rival political parties in Iraq and Lebanon. Attacks on the military are rare in Iran. Last year, in the first deadly assault claimed by Islamic State in Tehran, 18 people were killed at the parliament and mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder and first supreme leader of the Islamic Republic."

The group also claimed an attack in 2015 on the Corinthia hotel, a landmark location in Tripoli. The NOC attack came a day after the United Nations said major armed factions had agreed to freeze their positions to extend the ceasefire."
Ex-IS captive says son died in her lap from militant fire,"By the Associated Press DAMASCUS, Syria — A Syrian woman captured by Islamic State militants said her 8-year-old son died in her lap after the extremists shot him and his cousin during a military operation to liberate them more than 100 days after they were kidnapped. Najwa Abu Ammar, 35, was kidnapped with her two sons and daughter and nearly two dozen others in July from southern Sweida province in a bloody attack on their villages in which the militants killed over 200 people. When a military operation began to liberate them Thursday, the children panicked during the gunfire, she said. Her son Rafaat and his 13-year-old cousin Qusay ran and the militants fired at them. “We were in the open air at the bottom of a valley as the clashes raged between the army and gunmen,” she said. “When my son tried to run away, they (IS militants) shot him. He was in my lap when he died.” His cousin Qusay bled to death after nearly five hours, Abu Ammar said. ??I am very very sad,” she told The Associated Press in a telephone interview through a crackling line from her remote village of Shbiki. “I am tired.” A large funeral procession for the two children set out from the national hospital in Sweida to their village, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) to the east. “What is the sin of those innocent children, who should now be in their classrooms,” Monzer al-Shoufi, a resident of Sweida who took part in the procession, told AP by telephone. The family of Abu Ammar suffered another loss in the kidnapping — Rafaat’s grandmother was killed on the day of the abductions. Nashaat Abu Ammar, Rafaat’s father, said his mother was among those kidnapped by the militants, who forced the elderly, sick woman to walk about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles). When she failed to continue, they shot her dead. The rare attacks in the province populated mainly by minority Druze included several suicide bombings. The violence on July 25 devastated the community and shattered the region’s calm. At least 216 people were killed and the militants walked away with the captives. Nashaat Abu Ammar said about 20 of those killed were close relatives and 60 others were related. Najwa Abu Ammar said the captors held the group in different hideouts, including a camp and a cave, and once kept them in a moving car for over 12 hours, the captives not knowing where they were headed. The militants fed them sporadically and beat and insulted the children. They didn’t torture them, Abu Ammar said, but started threatening to kill them as time passed. At least two women and one man died in captivity, including a woman who was shot by the extremists to pressure authorities in negotiations for the captives’ release. “Sometimes they fed us once every two days and other times twice every day,” Abu Ammar said, adding that it was mostly just olive oil, thyme and jam. “They held us first in a camp then a cave and kept moving us from one place to the other,” she said. Abu Ammar said she didn’t know about the killed hostages until they were liberated. Six other hostages, two women and four children, had been freed in an exchange with the government in October. Negotiations were expected to free the remaining hostages but talks failed and Syrian troops launched a broad offensive against IS in southern Syria."
"In Syria’s Sweida, young men take up arms to defend villages"," By the Associated Press SWEIDA, Syria (AP) — Maysoun Saab’s eyes filled with tears as she recalled finding her parents bleeding to death on the ground outside their home, minutes after they were shot by Islamic State militants on a killing spree across once tranquil villages they infiltrated in a southeastern corner of Syria. Within an hour, she had lost her mother, father, brother and 34 other members of her extended family. Overall, more than 200 people were killed and 30 hostages abducted in the coordinated July 25 attacks across Sweida province. It was one of the biggest single massacres of the Syrian civil war and the worst bloodshed to hit the province since the conflict began in 2011, underscoring the persistent threat posed by the Islamic State group, which has been largely vanquished but retains pockets of territory in southern and eastern Syria. More than two months after the attack, tensions over the missing hostages — all women and children — are boiling over in Sweida, a mountainous area which is a center for the Druze religious minority. Anger is building up, and young men are taking up arms. This week, the militants shot dead one of the women, 25-year-old Tharwat Abu Ammar, triggering protests and a sit-in outside the Sweida governorate building by relatives enraged at the lack of progress in negotiations to free them. It’s a stark change for a usually peaceful province that has managed to stay largely on the sidelines of the seven-year Syrian war, and where most villagers work grazing livestock over the surrounding hills. “We still haven’t really absorbed what happened to us. It’s like a dream or a nightmare that you don’t wake up from,” said Saab, a slender woman with a long braid showing underneath a loose white scarf covering her hair. During a rare visit to the Sweida countryside by an Associated Press team, armed young men and teens, some as young as 14, patrolled the streets. Some wore military uniforms, others the traditional black baggy pants and white caps worn by Druze villagers. They said the Syrian army had provided them with weapons to form civilian patrols to defend their towns and villages. Residents recalled a summer day of pure terror that began with gunfire and cries of “Allahu Akbar!” that rang out at 4 a.m. Militants who had slipped into the villages under the cover of darkness knocked on doors, sometimes calling out residents’ names to trick them into opening. Those who did were gunned down. Others were shot in their beds. Women and children were dragged screaming from their homes. Word of the attack spread in the villages of Shbiki, Shreihi and Rami as neighbors called one another to warn of the militant rampage. A series of suicide bombings unfolded simultaneously in the nearby provincial capital of Sweida. In Shreihi, a small agricultural village of cement houses, Maysoun and her husband were asleep in one room, their children, 16-year-old Bayar and 13-year-old Habib, in another when she heard the first burst of gunfire. From her window, she saw the silhouette of her neighbor, Lotfi Saab, and his wife in their house. Then she saw armed men push open the door, point a rifle at them and shoot. Maysoon screamed, her voice reverberating through the open window. The militants threw a grenade in her direction. Her husband climbed onto the roof of their home and aimed a hunting rifle at the men, while she hunkered downstairs with the children. At least two of the men blew themselves up nearby. At the crack of dawn, Maysoun heard another neighbor screaming, “Abu Khaled has been shot!” — referring to Maysoun’s father. Ignoring her husband’s orders to stay indoors, Maysoun ran over the rocky path to her parent’s house, and spotted her father’s bloodied body on the ground near the front porch. She screamed for her mother and found her lying nearby, shot in her leg, blood everywhere. “There is no greater tragedy than to see your parents like this, strewn on the ground before your eyes. We were together just the night before, staying up late together and talking. … They took them away from us,” she said, choking back tears. Maysoun’s brother, Khaled, meanwhile, was trapped with his wife and daughter in their home, fearfully watching the IS fighters from their shuttered window. Another brother, who rushed to their aid, was killed outside Khaled’s home. Less than an hour later, Maysoun called to tell Khaled that both their parents were dead. When he was able to leave his house, Khaled said he and other neighbors fought and killed as many IS militants as they could. He suffered two gunshot wounds in his thigh. But there was no time to grieve. “We didn’t have the chance to cry or feel anything, even if our father, mother, neighbors, friends, all of these people had died. But at the time there wasn’t a moment to cry for anyone,” said the 42-year-old truck driver. Residents said the village men fought with whatever weapons they could lay their hands on — hunting rifles, pistols, even sticks — against the far superior IS guns. The Islamic State group, which once held large swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq, has been mostly vanquished. Its de facto capital of Raqqa, in eastern Syria, fell a year ago this month. But the group fights on in eastern pockets like Deir el-Zour and Sweida province. Some here fear that as the militants flee the advancing Syrian government forces, they will try to regroup in remote pockets of territory like this once quiet corner of Syria. They fear another raid or more trouble because of the brewing tensions over the hostages IS still holds. On Tuesday, a video posted on the internet purported to show IS militants shoot Abu Ammar in the back of her head as they threatened to kill more hostages if the Syrian government and its Russian allies do not meet their demands, which include freeing IS fighters and their family members elsewhere in Syria. In the village of Rami, where 20 civilians from the Maqlad family were killed in the July assault, Nathem Maqlad points to bullet holes and blood stains on the ground from the battle with IS. “I stand ready and alert to defend our land and dignity all over again if I have to,” he said, walking with a group of young men with rifles slung over their shoulders."
"Widow of Orlando nightclub gunman knew of his plans, prosecutors say","ORLANDO (REUTERS) - The widow of the gunman who killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in 2016 cased possible attack sites with her husband and did nothing to stop his plans, prosecutors told jurors at her federal trial on Wednesday (March 14). But a defence attorney for Noor Salman said she was a“simple woman who loved children” and did not know that her husband, Omar Mateen, intended to carry out the Pulse nightclub shooting on June 12, 2016. Duelling portraits of Salman, 31, emerged during opening statements at her trial in US District Court in Orlando. She faces up to life in prison if she is convicted of aiding and abetting her husband and obstructing a federal investigation. “The defendant’s cold actions gave Omar Mateen the green light to commit these crimes” on behalf of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Assistant US Attorney James Mandolfo told jurors. She is the only person charged in the massacre. Mateen died in an exchange of gunfire with police. Mandolfo said the government will put on evidence that Salman had foreknowledge of her husband’s deadly plot, including statements she made to investigators just hours afterward. She was at home with the couple’s then-three-year-old son during the shooting spree. Defence attorney Linda Moreno told jurors Salman was unaware of her husband’s sinister plans. “Noor was in the dark about Omar’s secret and despicable life,” Moreno said. Moreno said the FBI did not record its interrogation of Salman and coerced her into making statements that favoured the prosecution. Following opening statements prosecutors called several witnesses to describe the bloodshed and testify about Mateen’s calls to authorities. The trial is expected to last a month. Mateen, 29, opened fire shortly after last call for drinks on the club’s popular Latin night. Holding hostages during his standoff with police, he claimed allegiance to a leader of the ISIS militant group. According to prosecutors, Salman initially told investigators her husband acted without her knowledge but later said she knew he was watching Islamic State recruitment videos, had purchased an assault rifle and examined three possible attack locations. Salman’s attorneys contend prosecutors could not show any direct links between Mateen and Islamic State and have provided no evidence that Salman aided her husband. Salman was indicted on two charges: obstruction of justice for alleged false statements to federal investigators, and aiding and abetting Mateen in his attempt to provide material support to a terrorist organization."
"Widow of Orlando nightclub gunman goes on trial, facing life in prison","ORLANDO, March 14 — A trial for the widow of the gunman who killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in what prosecutors say was an attack in the name of Islamic State, was set to begin today with opening statements by both sides. Noor Salman, widow of Omar Mateen, faces up to life in prison if she is convicted in US District Court in Orlando of aiding and abetting her husband and obstructing a federal investigation into the June 12, 2016 massacre at the Pulse nightclub. Salman, 31, was at home with the couple’s then-3-year-old son during the shooting rampage, which ended with Mateen’s death in an exchange of gunfire with police. But prosecutors say she knew of her husband’s plans and did nothing to stop him. The trial, which is expected to last for a month, will take place at the Orlando courthouse where protesters have been gathering during jury selection to call for a guilty verdict. Inside the courtroom, the owner of the Pulse nightclub, Barbara Poma, has been present for some of the initial proceedings. Although Salman initially told investigators that her husband acted without her knowledge, she later acknowledged being aware that her husband was watching Islamic State recruitment videos, had purchased an assault rifle and examined three possible attack locations, according to prosecutors. Salman’s attorneys contend the U.S. government could not show any direct links between Mateen and Islamic State before the attack and has provided no evidence that Salman aided her husband. In court papers filed on Tuesday defense lawyers asked that prosecutors not be allowed to tell jurors during opening statements that the shooting rampage was intended as an attack on the gay community or that Salman took part in her husband’s gun and ammunition purchases. “It was Mateen, not Noor, who decided to attack the Pulse Night Club, Mateen who chose to drive to the club, Mateen who purchased the weapon and ammunition, and Mateen who alone carried out the attack,” the defense said in court filings. Salman was indicted on two charges: obstruction of justice for alleged false statements to federal investigators, and aiding and abetting Mateen in his attempt to provide material support to a terrorist organisation. Mateen, 29, opened fire shortly after the last call for drinks on the club’s popular Latin night. Holding hostages during his standoff with police, he claimed allegiance to a leader of the Islamic State militant group before being fatally shot."
Thousands march for Belgium terror shooting victims,"LIEGE, June 4 — Nearly 3,000 people marched in the Belgian city of Liege yesterday to honour the three victims of a shooting there last week that prosecutors are treating as a terrorist attack. The marchers, most dressed in white, made a solemn procession through the city’s sunny streets before laying white roses at the scene of the attack by Benjamin Herman, who shot dead two policewomen and a student on Tuesday. Hundreds of white balloons were released into the sky at the culmination of the march, which comes ahead of official funerals on Tuesday for the two slain officers, who have both been posthumously awarded Belgium’s highest civilian decoration. “I think it’s important to be here, just to support the family, not to change things. Just to show to the family that we are here and support them,” Marie Pousset, who was among nearly 3,000 marchers according to local police, told AFP. Government officials and a representative of Belgium’s king are set to attend the funerals for police officers Lucile Garcia, 54, and Soraya Belkacemi, 44, on Tuesday morning. Student Cyril Vangriecken, 22, shot dead by Herman as he sat in the passenger seat of a parked car, will be buried on Monday. Belgian police have identified Herman, 31, as a serial offender who spent a decade in and out of prison for acts of violence and petty crimes and came into contact with extremist Islamists while in jail. Herman attacked the two policewomen with a knife, stabbing them repeatedly before taking their service pistols and shooting them, then Vangriecken. Herman went on to hole up in a nearby school, briefly taking a cleaner hostage before bursting out to confront police and being cut down in a hail of bullets. The Islamic State group claimed one of its “soldiers” was responsible for the attack, through its Amaq propaganda agency. IS said “he led the attack in response to calls to target the countries of the US-led international coalition,” which is fighting the jihadist group, mainly in Syria. Prosecutors said Herman’s method of attack has been encouraged in online videos from IS, which claimed a deadly double suicide bombing in Brussels in 2016. "
"At least 30 hurt in Guinea clashes: medical source, witnesses"," At least 30 people were injured in clashes between opposition supporters and security forces in central Guinea, medical sources and witnesses said on Wednesday, after an opposition leader said his car was hit by gunfire a day earlier. Opposition leader Cellou Dalein Diallo, a chief rival of President Alpha Conde, on Tuesday said his vehicle was struck by a police bullet during a banned rally in the capital Conakry over disputed municipal elections. Police denied Diallo’s allegations, but a teenager was later killed during clashes between opposition youths and police in the capital. His family said he had been shot by police. Protests erupted on Wednesday after a meeting of Diallo’s UFDG party in Labe, his hometown and an opposition stronghold, 400 km (248 miles) north of Conakry, local party officials said. “There are at least 30 wounded among the demonstrators who we first received at the party headquarters before sending them to the regional hospital or private clinics,” said Dr. Saliou Malal Barry, who runs a private clinic in the town. Youths set up barricades and burned tires on several main routes in Labe to protest what Diallo had called an attempt to assassinate him. “We are ready for everything,” local UFDG representative Mamadou Dian Fadiga said. Local police official Amadou Camara said youths had taken to the streets, causing disturbances and forcing local businesses to shut down. “They were attacking everything close to them or anything appearing to be linked to the state and it took a massive deployment of security forces to calm the city centre,” Camara said. Tensions have been high in the poor West African country since the death on October 16 of a protester during a two-day opposition campaign aimed at bringing Conakry to a standstill. The opposition claims Conde’s government has reneged on a deal to install new officials elected in the contested February 4 municipal ballot, the first such vote since the end of a military dictatorship a decade ago. Authorities have started to install new municipal officials, with the opposition accusing the government of bribing some to keep control of local councils across the former French colony. The municipal elections had been repeatedly delayed because of political infighting and the Ebola crisis in 2013-16."
Saudi forces arrest armed ‘extremist’ after gunfight: Ministry,"Saudi forces have arrested a heavily armed “extremist” after wounding him in an exchange of gunfire in the kingdom’s conservative central heartland, the interior ministry said early Thursday. The man had embraced the Islamic State group’s “ideology” and was found to be in possession of a machine gun, a pistol and multiple rounds of ammunition, the ministry said in a statement. The man in Al-Bukhariya city was also wearing what appeared to be an explosives-laden belt, state-run Al-Ekhbariya television reported. The incident comes as the kingdom prepares to host the annual hajj pilgrimage from August 19-24. The kingdom has seen numerous attacks in recent years by jihadists, including Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group, against security forces. It has also seen clashes between Shiite militants and security forces in the eastern provinces. In July, a drive-by shooting against a checkpoint in central Saudi Arabia and an ensuing gunfight left a security officer, a Bangladeshi civilian and two attackers dead, according to the interior ministry. And in April, four Saudi policemen were killed and four others wounded in an attack targeting a checkpoint in the southwestern province of Asir."
Paris attacks documentary shows victims’ defiance in face of horror,"PARIS, May 31 — “I’m not going to be killed by some guy in jogging pants,” one of the Bataclan survivors told herself as jihadists raked the Paris concert hall with gunfire. Remarkable testimony from dozens of survivors of the bloodbath form the core of a new three-part documentary about the November 13 carnage by the French brothers who won an Emmy for 9/11, the inside story of the heroics of New York firefighters on September 11, 2001. Although filmmaker Jules Naudet was in the World Trade Centre when the second plane struck — after already capturing the first one hitting the North Tower — he and his brother were not in Paris when the attackers struck in November 2015 , killing 130 people. But their documentary mini-series, Attack on Paris — which starts on Netflix tomorrow — tells the story through the eyes of those at the heart of the drama. Through 40 interviews with survivors, the first police and ambulance officers at the scenes and former French president Francois Hollande, the pair try to recreate the terrible night which began with a suicide bombing at the Stade de France football stadium. “You get the feeling that (the survivors) are all looking you in the eye” as they tell their stories, Jules Naudet told AFP. “It was about creating a bubble where you forget the outside world” and are plunged back into the events which “are told in the present tense”, he added. His brother Gedeon said the fact they themselves had lived through a major terror attack — the pair were with the firefighters as they tried to evacuate the towers — helped create a bond with the survivors. “They talked about things that you share between survivors. They themselves were surprised that they were so open, like you would be in therapy,” he said of the interviews, which were filmed over the course of eight months. “We told them about what happened to us on September 11, the stages of trauma we went through, and they were very curious,” Gedeon Naudet added. One of the most surprising things to emerge from the documentaries was the manner in which many of the survivors talk about the gunmen. None of the jihadists are ever named — nor is the Islamic State mentioned — so “the films can never be used as propaganda”, the brothers say. Instead, the Bataclan survivors refer to the killers with barely concealed derision, remembering “the big dumbo” or “the angry little git”, describing them collectively as blundering “donkeys”. One woman taken hostage as the attackers holed themselves up at the end of the siege, had a typically Parisian take on their dress sense. “I not going to be killed by some guy in jogging pants,” she said to herself. But others made no attempt to hide the horror that was unleashed as the gunmen burst in on a concert by US band Eagles of Death Metal. “The room transformed into an immense collective cry of agony,” one survivor recalled, while another talked of the “discreet heroism” of people trying to help each other in the most dangerous of circumstances. “It was so horrible that after a while my brain just cut off the sounds because it was unbearable,” said a third. Christophe Molmy, head of the police intervention brigade (BRI), said what he and his officers saw when they stormed the building will be forever “chiselled into our memories... It made me think of Dante’s ‘Inferno’,” he said."
"A year after extremist siege, Philippine families seek closure","Mahid Radia's last glimpse of his parents was when he and his children were fleeing their home amid gunfire, explosions and the howl of airplanes bombing the dens of extremists who had taken over Marawi, the Philippines' only Islamic city. MARAWI CITY, Philippines: Mahid Radia's last glimpse of his parents was when he and his children were fleeing their home amid gunfire, explosions and the howl of airplanes bombing the dens of extremists who had taken over Marawi, the Philippines' only Islamic city. The military prevailed over Islamic State-inspired rebels in the country's biggest and longest battle since World War Two. One year since the fighting began, there is peace in Marawi, but little else. Radia's lakeside home is a pile of rubble, like scores of others in the former war zone. His mother and father are still missing, and he yearns for closure. ""Our parents decided to stay home in the belief the fighting would end in days,"" said Radia, 31, the eldest of 11 siblings. ""We pray that if they died, their remains were retrieved."" Hundreds of families are missing relatives since the start of a war that few saw coming, and which could happen again, the government has warned, if Islamic State's radical ideology spreads among the Muslim minority in the mainly Catholic nation. About 165 security forces and 47 residents were confirmed killed in the battle for Marawi. But people from Marawi believe the number of civilians killed was far higher. The official death toll in the five-month war is 1,109, mostly members of a shadowy militant alliance that drew fighters from radical factions of domestic Islamist groups. It has taken six months to clear hundreds of unexploded bombs and booby traps and for volunteers to sift the debris. Samples of DNA have been taken from 244 retrieved bodies, prior to their burial in numbered graves. Radia hopes to find his mother and father, but tracing matches is difficult. Relatives have claimed just 11 bodies so far. The task becomes tougher because the bodies of residents trapped or held captive in the war zone cannot be distinguished from those of slain militants. ""We had instances when we identified the deceased and we coordinated with the relatives, but they did not claim the cadaver,"" said Norhanie Marohombsar, the head of the interior ministry in Marawi. ""The relatives fear being tagged as part of the insurgency."" Authorities and aid workers have different estimates of the number of residents still missing since the fighting ended in October. Marawi Mayor Majul Gandamra put the number at 50, while the provincial disaster agency says it is 78. International Committee of the Red Cross workers in Marawi estimate 100 families are missing relatives. Marawi evacuee Malik Manguda struggles to move on with his life because he does not know what happened to his 20-year-old son, Ramos. He has seen a photograph of a dead body that resembles his son, but it's not enough. ""Many times I am not myself,"" said Manguda. ""I thought parents are supposed to die ahead of their children."" About 28,000 families remain displaced and many fear they will have no home to return to. With no money or insurance, some must also tackle issues of proving land ownership. Residents have taken every opportunity to stake their claims during visits the military has recently begun to allow to the battle zone, lasting just a few hours each. Names and contact details are spraypainted or etched in charcoal on the blackened skeletons of former homes. Others came prepared with tarpaulins and painted banners. The military is bent on preventing a repeat of Marawi, but intelligence reports suggest an effort by extremists to start recruiting again. The government has warned against potential attacks on other cities. The army has held meetings and seminars to warn people to resist radical groups and help the government to stop them. ""Not all local terrorist groups died. There still are remnants,"" said Major Jeoffrey Braganza of Joint Task Group Tabang, which is helping Marawi's recovery effort. ""For the remnants, we are in hot pursuit with the help of reports from the ground,"" he added."
"US, Afghanistan launch air strikes as Taliban attack western city","US and Afghan aircraft Tuesday bombed Taliban positions in the western city of Farah after the insurgents launched a major attempt to capture the provincial capital, with fearful residents seeking shelter from explosions and gunfire. Special forces from Kandahar and Herat were rushed to the city to take part in the fighting, which residents said began around midnight. Sporadic clashes were still ongoing late Tuesday, provincial council member Dadullah Qani told AFP. It was the latest in a series of attempts by the Taliban over the past three years to capture urban centres. Afghan forces have been struggling to hold back the resurgent militant group since the withdrawal of NATO combat forces at the end of 2014. Afghan officials and NATO’s Resolute Support mission said that the government remained in control, but the Taliban also appeared confident, posting a flurry of social media updates throughout the day that purported to show their fighters in the city. Farah province, which borders Iran, has been the scene of intense fighting in recent years, and there have long been fears that the city is vulnerable. “The situation is very bad,” Satar Hussaini, a tribal elder in Farah, told AFP earlier. “Heavy fighting is going on and Taliban are in the city but the police headquarters and NDS (the Afghan intelligence agency) have not fallen to them,” he said. “NDS forces in their HQ are engaged in heavy clashes with the Taliban.” Qani confirmed Hussaini’s comments. Gunfire and explosions could be heard as he spoke to an AFP reporter by telephone. The noise has “filled the city”, said one resident who gave his name as Bilal, adding that he could see smoke rising from the direction of a building housing the NDS. NATO’s Resolute Support mission in Kabul said the government remained in control of the city. “Both Afghan A-29s and Mi-17s have conducted multiple strikes. U.S. forces have conducted one drone strike (MQ-9) and a show-of-force with A-10s. Dozens of Taliban killed.” Defence ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanish said pockets of resistance remained, but “our forces are battling the enemy with high morale”. With internet and mobile networks patchy, casualty figures were difficult to verify. Radmanish said four soldiers and “dozens” of insurgents had been killed. At least some militants have been hiding in private houses, making it difficult for Afghan forces to use heavy weapons, Farah governor Abdul Basir Salangi told Ariana News, adding: “But still we are taking back positions one by one.” Many radio and television channels in the province have stopped broadcasting, fearing for their employees’ lives, according to media watchdog Nai. The insurgents in a statement warned residents to remain in their homes and “stay calm”. The Taliban are stepping up their spring offensive, in an apparent rejection of a peace talks overture from the government. But it has been the scene of intense fighting in recent years. In 2017, insurgents tried three times to overrun the capital, according to the Afghanistan Analysts Network. As such, Tuesday’s offensive “should not have taken government forces off guard”, said military analyst and retired general Atiqullah Amarkhail. Amarkhail added that “even ordinary citizens were aware of the Taliban gradually taking over more areas and becoming a formidable force in the province”. He accused the government and military leadership of “turning a blind eye” until the insurgents actually entered the city. Afghan troops and police nationwide have struggled to cope with unrelenting militant attacks in recent years, their numbers sapped by killings and desertions. When asked about the issue, US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said that Afghan forces are actually being bolstered in the most important area — special operations forces. Speaking earlier this month, he said this expansion was why the Taliban had not taken any district centres or provincial centres. The insurgents have tried several times to take provincial capitals in recent years, including Kunduz and Lashkar Gah, with the Afghan army deploying significant numbers of troops to hold those cities and push the militants out. Kunduz, Afghanistan’s fifth largest city and capital of the northern province of the same name, fell briefly to the Taliban in 2015. They along with the Islamic State group have also stepped up their attacks in the capital Kabul, which the UN says has in recent years become one of the country’s deadliest places for civilians."
Heavy fighting as Taliban attack western Afghan city," Afghan aircraft Tuesday bombed Taliban positions in the western city of Farah after the insurgents launched a major attempt to capture the provincial capital, with fearful residents seeking shelter from explosions and gunfire. The attack — the first major assault targeting a city since the Taliban launched their annual spring offensive — began around midnight, with the militants capturing one urban district and parts of another, said local provincial council member Jamila Amini. “Heavy fighting continues inside the city and aircraft have just started bombarding Taliban positions,” she told AFP Tuesday from inside Farah. Afghan officials said police special forces from Kandahar and commandos from Herat had also been deployed. “(The Taliban) will fail,” vowed interior ministry spokesman Najib Danish, who said both Afghan and foreign air forces were taking part in the fighting. There was no immediate confirmation from NATO’s mission in Kabul. Defence ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanish said at least 10 insurgents and two Afghan security force members had been killed so far. “The situation is under control and will change by the end of the day,” he said. But inside the city residents reported clashes were continuing. “The situation is very bad,” Satar Hissaini, a tribal elder in Farah, told AFP. “Heavy fighting is going on and Taliban are in the city but the police headquarters and NDS (the Afghan intelligence agency) have not fallen to them,” he said. “NDS forces in their HQ are engaged in heavy clashes with the Taliban.” Another provincial council member, Dadullah Qani, confirmed Hissaini’s comments, the sound of gunfire and explosions audible as he spoke to an AFP reporter by telephone. The noise has “filled the city”, said one resident who gave his name as Bilal, adding that he could see smoke rising from the direction of a building housing the NDS. At least some militants have been hiding in residential houses, making it difficult for Afghan forces to use heavy weapons, Farah governor Abdul Basir Salangi told Ariana News, adding: “But still we are taking back positions one by one”. The insurgents released a statement warning residents to stay inside their homes and “stay calm”. They have also been posting images on social media they claim shows them inside the city. Many radio and television channels in the province have stopped broadcasting, fearing for their employees’ lives, according to media watchdog Nai. The Taliban are stepping up their spring offensive, in an apparent rejection of a peace talks overture from the government. Farah is a poppy-growing province in an isolated region of Afghanistan. There are plans for a section of the multi-billion-dollar TAPI (Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India) gas pipeline to traverse it, a project the Taliban have pledged to cooperate with. But it has been the scene of intense fighting in recent years. In 2017 insurgents tried three times to overrun the capital, according to the Afghanistan Analysts Network. As such Tuesday’s offensive “should not have taken government forces off guard,” Afghan military analyst and retired general Atiqullah Amarkhail told AFP.

 Suicide attack on Libya election commission kills 12,"TRIPOLI, May 2 — Suicide attackers killed at least 12 people at Libya’s electoral commission in the capital Tripoli today, authorities in the violence-wracked country said, after witnesses reported thick smoke and gunfire. The internationally backed Government of National Accord (GNA) said it was dealing with “the consequences of the cowardly suicide attack” after the health ministry put the toll at 12 dead and seven wounded. Four armed assailants attacked the building this morning, a senior security official in Tripoli, Mohamad al-Damja, told AFP. “They killed the guards before opening fire at people on the premises,” he said. At least two of the attackers detonated their explosives when the security forces arrived, Damja added, describing the building as seriously damaged after it caught on fire. Security forces have since brought the situation under control, he said, while the site has been sealed off. Eyewitnesses earlier said shots and at least two explosions were heard, while black smoke could be seen rising from the headquarters of the national election commission. The assault has not yet been claimed. Election hopes -The United Nations mission in Libya condemned the “terrorist attack” and said it extended “its condolences to the families of the victims who lost their lives”. “Such terrorist attacks will not deter Libyans from moving forward in the process of consolidating national unity and building the state of law and institutions,” it said on Twitter. The UN is hoping that Libya can hold elections this year as it seeks to leave behind years of chaos since the 2011 ouster of dictator Muammar Gaddafi. UN special envoy Ghassan Salame said in February he was aiming for parliamentary and presidential elections in the North African country by the end of 2018, but warned conditions were not yet ready for polling. The electoral commission is considered to be one of the few credible and independent institutions in the country. Elections were banned during Kadhafi’s 42-rule and after his ousting legislative polls were organised in 2012 and 2014. But turmoil has continued in Libya with rival militias, tribes and jihadists vying for territory and the country’s vast oil wealth. A 2015 UN-backed deal to set up the GNA in Tripoli failed to end the turmoil, as divisions continue with a rival administration in the east. Human Rights Watch warned in March the country was far from ready in political, judicial or security terms for elections, citing harassment of activists and journalists as among the problems to be overcome. A new constitution has to be put to a referendum and an electoral law adopted before polling. As of March, 2.4 million Libyan voters had been registered of a population of six million. While most recent attacks across Libya have been outside Tripoli, the capital remains mired by insecurity. In January clashes between rival militias around the city’s only working international airport left some 20 people dead. In 2015 the Islamic State group claimed an attack on Tripoli’s luxury Corinthia Hotel that killed nine people, including five foreigners."
Four Saudi officers killed in gun attack,"Four Saudi officers were shot dead and four others wounded Thursday when their checkpoint came under gunfire in southern Asir province, state media said citing the interior ministry. Three officers were instantly killed when the outpost came under attack, the Saudi Press Agency reported, without specifying who was behind it. ""Security officials have succeeded in identifying a number of suspects involved in the crime and arrested two of them, both Saudi nationals,"" SPA said. ""In the interest of the investigation, their names cannot be revealed."" A third Saudi suspect opened fire as he tried to escape, killing another officer and wounding four others, SPA added. The attack comes as Saudi Arabia is embroiled in a long running conflict in its southern neighbor Yemen, dubbed by the United Nations as the world's worst humanitarian crisis. In March 2015, the kingdom launched a coalition of Arab states fighting to roll back Iran-backed Huthi rebels in Yemen and restore the country's internationally-recognised government to power. Riyadh and Shiite rival Tehran back opposing sides in a range of hotspots across the mainly Sunni Muslim Middle East, including Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen. Since late 2014, the Islamic State group has claimed a series of bombings and shootings against Shiites and security forces in the Sunni-majority kingdom. Saudi Arabia is a member of the US-led international coalition that has helped battle the Sunni extremist group in Syria and Iraq. Last November, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman vowed to ""pursue terrorists until they are wiped from the face of the earth"" as he presided over the first meeting of an Islamic counter-terrorism alliance involving around 40 Muslim countries."

Indonesian police foil terror attacks ahead of Polling Day,"Indonesian police have foiled at least two terrorist attacks planned for the upcoming regional elections, after officers shot dead three suspects last week in West Java. The separate incidents, which took place in Subang last Friday and Depok last Saturday, come just days before more than 150 million Indonesians head to the polls to elect their local leaders on Wednesday. The suspect killed in Friday's police ambush on an overpass in Pamanukan, Subang, was carrying a homemade bomb, complete with a detonator, in his backpack, said the police yesterday. He was shot after he lunged at police officers with a knife as he was being apprehended. National police spokesman M. Iqbal said the suspect, identified only as M, was preparing to strike during the June 27 elections, known locally as Pilkada. Two other suspects, killed in a similar police operation on Saturday morning, also had plans to mount attacks on Polling Day. AS and AZ were gunned down by the police in Depok after they tried to resist arrest. Another suspect, MM, was nabbed later that same day in connection to AS and AZ. According to General Iqbal, the two men, aged 27 and 31, were armed with a commando knife and a loaded FN pistol. FN is the acronym for Belgium-based Fabrique Nationale, one of the world's largest exporters of military small arms. Gen Iqbal did not say where the suspects may have acquired the pistol, although he confirmed that both AS and AZ had previously undergone paramilitary training under Indonesian militant leader Bahrumsyah. It is widely believed that Bahrumsyah is in command of a group of South-east Asian militants who have travelled to the Middle East to fight for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). But the authorities have been investigating online chatter picked up in April saying that the Indonesian militant was killed during air strikes in Syria by the United States. Bahrumsyah is a senior figure in the Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), an Indonesian terrorist network. Both he and JAD leader Aman Abdurrahman were placed on a US terrorist watch list in January last year. The US State Department also referred to the JAD as a terrorist group that pledged allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The JAD is responsible for the spate of terrorist attacks in Indonesia. These include the January 2016 siege in the capital Jakarta, which killed four bystanders; the twin suicide bombings in East Jakarta on May 23 last year, which killed three policemen; and last month's series of suicide bombings in Surabaya, in which 14 victims died. Security has been beefed up in the country, with the government mobilising the military to supplement the police force in a move made possible after Indonesia's anti-terror laws were amended following the Surabaya bombings. The country remains on edge as the upcoming polls being held in 171 regions are also coming after a South Jakarta court last Friday sentenced Aman to death for inciting the attack in Jakarta two years ago, as well as at least four other JAD strikes across the country. The court's decision marked the end of a closely watched trial, which started after the police, in a rare move last August, decided to identify the terrorist leader as a suspect in attacks that he was not directly involved in. Aman has been in prison since 2010, and was serving time for funding a Jemaah Islamiah paramilitary training camp in Aceh, when four JAD militants mounted the Jakarta strike in 2016. He is said to have ordered his followers to mount attacks from behind bars, purportedly using mobile phones hidden in his cell. Analyst Adhe Bhakti, who has followed the militant leader's rise to the top of the JAD, told The Straits Times that Aman remains an influential figure and ""revenge attacks by his followers can be expected""."
Police nab terror suspects in Medan,"Counterterrorism squad Densus 88, with the assistance of North Sumatra Police personnel, have arrested a number of terror suspects in several locations in North Sumatra, including the provincial capital of Medan, following the church attacks in Surabaya. North Sumatra Police chief Insp. Gen. Paulus Waterpauw confirmed the arrests, including one in Tanjung Balai city on Tuesday, where security personnel shot one suspect dead and injured another for resisting arrest. Meanwhile, Densus 88 personnel arrested at least two other suspects in Medan, who were identified as 28-year-old ojek driver MYR and 38-year-old milk seller SL, on the same day. A suspect identified as W reportedly fled during an attempted arrest. All suspects have been taken to the North Sumatra Police’s Mobile Brigade headquarters and put under heavy guard of police personnel. The police, however, had yet to publish the number and names of suspects as of Wednesday evening. “We are still investigating it,” North Sumatra Police spokesman Adj. Sr. Comr. Tatan Dirsan Atmaja said. Since the suicide bombings on three churches in East Java’s Surabaya, police personnel have arrested a number of terror suspects across the country, namely 13 in East Java, two in South Sumatra’s Palembang, one in Riau’s Pekanbaru and three in Banten’s Tangerang. The police have also shot dead several others including four in Pekanbaru. "
Counter-terrorism police investigating makeshift bombs found in London flat,"HARLESDEN, Nov 22 — British counter-terrorism police were investigating two suspected improvised explosive devices discovered in an unoccupied flat in northwest London yesterday. The block of flats in Harlesden was evacuated during the operation to make the devices safe and residents have since been allowed to return, London’s Metropolitan Police said in a statement. The devices are undergoing forensic examination and the force’s Counter Terrorism Command has launched an investigation. Chief Superintendent Simon Rose called on the public to come forward with any information. “I also want to reassure the local community that we have carried out precautionary searches in the surrounding area to make sure there was nothing else of a similar nature nearby, which I’m pleased to confirm is the case,” he said. Britain is on its second-highest threat level after several attacks in 2017. "
Police officer slightly injured in Brussels knife attack,"BRUSSELS, Nov 20 — A Brussels police officer was injured in a knife attack in front of the city’s main police station early this morning, a spokeswoman said. The attack took place on the second day of a state visit to Belgium by French President Emmanuel Macron with memories of the Paris and Brussels attacks running high. An assailant stabbed the officer outside the central police station at 5:30am, police spokeswoman Ilse van de Keere told AFP. “A police officer was stabbed and slightly wounded” and taken to hospital, she said. “His colleagues retaliated by firing shots at the attacker who was subdued” but whose life is not in danger. The spokeswoman refused to confirm a local media report that the attacker had cried Allahu Akbar (God is Greatest) during the incident. Later today, Macron visits the Brussels district of Molenbeek, home of Islamic State jihadists who carried out the 2015 Paris attacks that left 130 people dead. "
Police say treating Melbourne stabbing as a terror attack,"Australian police on Friday said a deadly knife attack in Melbourne was an act of terror, revealing that the deceased suspect was originally from Somalia and was known to intelligence agencies. ""We are now treating this as a terrorism event,"" said Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton, adding that the suspect is ""someone that is known to us"" and had travelled to central Melbourne in a 4x4 packed with gas bottles. Ashton said the attacker -- who was shot by police and later died in custody -- was known by the authorities because of family connections and had been in Australia for decades. The counter-terrorism command has taken a lead role in the investigation. One person was killed in the attack and two others were injured. Police officers who apprehended the suspect are being treated for cuts and scrapes and are not thought to be in a serious condition. Ashton said the authorities do not see any ongoing threat related to the attack."
7 wounded including 2 British tourists in Paris knife attack,"PARIS — Seven people including two British tourists were wounded Sunday in Paris after they were attacked by a man armed with a knife and an iron bar, according to police and other sources. A source close to the inquiry said the suspect, believed to be an Afghan national, has been arrested. ""Nothing at this stage shows signs of a terrorist nature in these assaults,"" the source said, adding that the attacker had targeted ""strangers in the street"". Of the seven wounded, four are in a critical condition, police said. The incident took place just after 11:00pm (2100 GMT) on the banks of a canal in the northeast of the capital. A security guard at one of two cinemas on either side of the Bassin de la Villette, part of the Canal de l’Ourcq, said he saw a man who had already assaulted people being chased by two other men who tried to stop him. ""He had an iron bar in his hand which he threw at the men chasing him, then he took out a knife,"" he said. Another eyewitness, 28-year-old Youssef Najah, said he was walking along the canal near a bowling green when he saw a man running and holding a knife about 25-30cm long. ""There were around 20 people chasing him. They started throwing Petanque balls at him,"" Najah said, referring to the sport popular in France also known as boules. ""Around four or five balls hit him in the head, but they weren’t able to stop him,"" he added. According to the same witness, the attacker then dived into an alleyway, where the man ""tried to hide behind two British tourists. We said to them: ’Watch out, he has a knife"". But they didn’t react"". The pair were then attacked, he said. High alert A police investigation has been launched for attempted murder, according to a judicial source. It is the latest of several knife attacks France has seen in recent months, with terrorism being ruled out in most cases. On August 23, a man stabbed his mother and sister to death and seriously injured another person in a town near Paris before being shot dead by police. The motive for the violence remained unclear despite a claim by the Islamic State (IS) group that it was an attack by one of its fighters responding to the terror organisation’s propaganda. Authorities said the 36-year-old had serious mental health problems and had been on a terror watch list since 2016. That attack came days after an Afghan asylum-seeker was arrested in the town of Perigueux for a drunken rampage with a knife in which four people were wounded, one seriously. Police said investigators had ""very quickly"" dismissed a terrorist motive after the August 13 incident. And on June 17, two people were hurt in another southern town when a woman shouting ""Allahu akbar"" (God is greatest) attacked them in a supermarket with a boxcutter knife. France has been on high alert following a string of jihadist attacks in recent years, often by people who have become radicalised or claim to have acted in the name of the IS group. More than 240 people have been killed by Islamic extremists since a massacre at the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine in Paris in January 2015."
Spanish police treat attempted knife attack as terrorist act,"MADRID: A man, wielding a knife and uttering the word ""Allah"" lunged at an officer in a police station near Barcelona, Spain, on Monday in what police said was a terrorist act, and was shot dead. Police said the man entered the station in Cornella, in the northeastern region of Catalonia, shortly before 0400 GMT, seeking information. He then leapt towards a female officer, brandishing a large knife, they said. The attacker, identified only as living in Cornella, was shot dead. ""The officer can only remember that he used the word Allah, the other words were incomprehensible,"" regional investigating police chief Rafel Comas told a news conference. ""On this evidence, for the moment, we are treating it as a terrorist attack."" The Arabic phrase ""Allahu akbar"" (God is greatest) has often been used by jihadist attackers. The attacker ""wanted to die himself"", police added on Twitter. Comas did not confirm Spanish media reports that he was a 29-year-old Algerian, saying only that he had been in the country ""for years"". Forensic investigators and officers with dogs later searched the attacker's house in Cornella, evacuating neighbouring houses as a precaution. ""With the information that we have right now we can say that it was an isolated event that targeted the police,"" Catalan interior minister Miquel Buch said at a news conference when he was asked whether the attacker was part of a terrorist cell. Buch added the situation had been dealt with. Spain would maintain its security alert at level 4, one notch below the maximum level which signals an attack is imminent. Last Friday, Barcelona commemorated the first anniversary of an Islamist assault in which a young man drove a van down a busy central boulevard, killing 14 people and injuring over 100 in Spain's worst attack in more than a decade. Separately on Monday, three people were injured when a car mounted a pavement in the northern town of Casetas, in what a government spokeswoman later said was being treated as an accident. The two occupants of the car fled the scene and were later detained."
UK police hunt object that poisoned couple with nerve agent,"SALISBURY, July 6 — Police today raced to find the object that contaminated a British couple with the Soviet-made Novichok nerve agent in southwestern England where a former Russian spy was poisoned with the same toxin four months ago. Dawn Sturgess, 44, and Charlie Rowley, 45, fell ill on Saturday in Amesbury, a small town near the city of Salisbury where Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia collapsed on March 4, spreading fear once again among locals. Police said they had established that the couple, who remain in a critical condition in hospital, were exposed to the nerve agent after “handling a contaminated item.” They also did not rule out the possibility of more people coming into contact with the poison, which they suspect may have been left over from the attempted murder on the Skripals, although police have yet to determine whether it was the same batch. “It is rather scary,” local resident Geoffrey, 66, told AFP, as he walked by the canal. “It is an agent, it is not a gun or a knife that you can find and dispose of. It is something different, it could be on that bench... it makes me worried.” Dentist Jane Turner, 57, said she was concerned about children who “can pick things up without even thinking”. London blames Russia for the Skripal attack, with interior minister Sajid Javid on Thursday accusing Moscow of using Britain as a “dumping ground for poison”. “It is now time that the Russian state comes forward and explains exactly what has gone on,” Javid told parliament. “It is completely unacceptable for our people to be either deliberate or accidental targets, or for our streets, our parks, our towns to be dumping grounds for poison.” But Russia quickly hit back, denouncing Britain for playing “dirty political games”, trying to “muddy the waters” and “frighten its own citizens”. “We urge British law enforcement not to get involved in dirty political games,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters. “This government and its representatives will have to apologise to Russia and the international community,” she said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described the case as “very worrying” but said Russia had no information “about what substances were used and how they were used”. The Skripal incident triggered a major diplomatic crisis, leading to Britain and its allies withdrawing diplomatic staff from Moscow and tit-for-tat expulsions by Russia. Novichok is a military-grade nerve agent developed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. A government scientist told the BBC yesterday that the agent can be degraded by water and sunlight, meaning it was unlikely the contamination took place in the open, and said that it was so toxic that it could pass through the skin. Police declared a major incident on Wednesday after Sturgess and then Rowley collapsed on Saturday. They initially suspected that the couple had consumed a contaminated batch of illegal drugs, saying they had found “paraphernalia” in the house, but tests at nearby defence laboratory Porton Down revealed they had been exposed to Novichok. A friend of Rowley’s told AFP that he was a drug user and Sturgess lived in a homeless hostel in Salisbury. Around 100 counter-terror detectives are now working alongside police on the investigation, with officers in protective equipment and police tape once again visible on the quiet streets of Salisbury. Several sites in the city and nearby Amesbury that were visited by the couple have been cordoned off, including a park and Sturgess’s homeless hostel in Salisbury, as well as a pharmacy, church and the house in Amesbury where they fell ill. Officials said there was only a “low risk” to the wider public, but urged anyone who had visited the affected sites to wash their clothes and wipe down personal items. The Novichok used in March was believed to have been smeared on the Skripal’s front door. Police said there was no evidence the latest victims had visited any of the sites linked to the Skripals, which have since been decontaminated. Sam Hobson, a friend of the couple, said he had visited Salisbury with them the day before they fell ill. Hobson said he went to Rowley’s house on Saturday as Sturgess was being taken to hospital and stayed with him for several hours until he too began to complain of feeling ill. “He was sweating loads, dribbling, and you couldn’t speak to him,” Hobson said. “It’s like he was in another world, hallucinating.” "
"Police shoot knife-wielding man at Berlin Cathedral, 'terror' ruled out","BERLIN: Police shot and wounded a knife-wielding man inside Berlin's main cathedral on Sunday (Jun 3) but said there was no indication the assailant had a ""terrorist"" motive. The man with the knife, a 53-year-old Austrian, was ""yelling and causing damage"" before being shot in the leg shortly after 4.00 pm (8.00pm Singapore time), police said in a statement. When the incident began, about 100 people were evacuated from the landmark Berlin Cathedral in the heart of the German capital. When officers arrived they urged the man to put down the knife and tried to neutralise him with irritant gas, to no success, police said. Finally, they faced the assailant near the altar of the cathedral, and ""the man was wounded in the leg by a shot from a policeman,"" a spokesman said. The man was hospitalised and underwent surgery, the spokesman added. A policeman was also slightly injured by a ricocheting bullet from another officer, but was able to leave the hospital in the evening. Witnesses told local media that the man appeared ""very confused"". ""Based on what we know so far, we have no information that the suspect in any way had a terrorist or Islamist motive,"" a police spokesman said. The iron-domed Protestant cathedral, one of the city's top tourist attractions, is on Museum Island off east Berlin's main Unter den Linden boulevard and close to the Alexanderplatz shopping district. An AFP reporter said the entrances to the church were blocked off with red-and-white police tape and several officers with automatic weapons were patrolling the scene. DPA news agency said some witnesses were taken away to receive psychological counselling. The shooting comes with authorities in a state of high alert for militant attacks after several assaults claimed by the Islamic State group in the country. Like other European nations, Germany remains a target for Islamist militant groups, in particular because of its involvement in the coalition fighting IS in Iraq and Syria, and its deployment in Afghanistan since 2001. In the worst militant attack in the country to date, Tunisian asylum seeker Anis Amri rammed a truck into crowds at a Berlin Christmas market in December 2016, killing 12. The assault occurred in the shadow of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, a war-damaged landmark in the west of the capital. A court in March sentenced a 26-year-old Palestinian asylum seeker to life in prison for killing one and wounding six others with a knife in a Hamburg supermarket out of a ""jihadist"" motive last July. In April, Berlin police briefly detained six men amid fears of an attack on the city's half marathon, which drew 36,000 runners. But they were released when searches of their homes and vehicles netted no weapons, explosives or other evidence. The same weekend, a German driver in the western city of Muenster ploughed a van into an open-air restaurant, killing two people. The driver later shot himself and investigators cited mental health problems, not a political motive, as being behind the attack. Germany's security services estimate there are around 10,000 Islamic radicals in Germany, some 1,600 of whom are suspected of being potentially violent. Political opponents of Chancellor Angela Merkel, including the far-right AfD party, have charged that the security situation has worsened with the arrival of more than one million migrants and refugees since 2015, many from African and Middle Eastern conflict hotspots."
German police arrest three Iraqis suspected of planning attack,"BERLIN, Jan 30 — German police arrested three Iraqi citizens on suspicion they were planning an Islamist-motivated attack, the federal prosecutor’s office said today. “According to the findings to date, the suspects had not yet selected a specific target for their attack,” the federal prosecutor’s office said in a statement."
"Finland knife attacker was fully aware of his actions, according to psychiatric assessment","HELSINKI, March 9 — A Moroccan man charged with two murders and eight attempted murders “with terrorist intent” was criminally responsible for his knife attacks in Finland last August, a psychiatric assessment showed yesterday. The trial of Abderrahman Bouanane, who was 22 at the time at the attacks, is due to begin in the city of Turku later this month. The state prosecutor has demanded a life sentence for him if the court rules he was fully aware of his actions. Bouanane has admitted the attacks but has denied that his motive was terrorism. The police have concluded that he was a “lone wolf” who saw himself as a soldier for the Islamic State militant group. ISIS did not take responsibility for the act. Bouanane arrived in Finland in 2016, lived in a reception centre in Turku and had been denied asylum. It is the Nordic country’s first terrorism-related attack. A life sentence in Finland means at least 12 years in prison."
Belgium police open fire on attacker with knife," BRUSSELS, Jan 24 — Railway security opened fire yesterday on a man who threatened them with a knife at a train station in the Belgian city of Ghent, Belgian media said. RTBF television said the man’s condition was not immediately known following the incident whose circumstances and possible motive remained unclear. Belgium lowered its terror threat level Monday after three years of high alert that included the March 2016 Brussels suicide bombings, but soldiers continued to guard key sites. The federal prosecutor’s office which handles terrorism cases told AFP the incident “was not a case for the federal prosecutor at this stage, but it could be one later”."
Dutch intelligence thwart four terror plots since 2011,"THE HAGUE, Jan 11 — Dutch security forces have thwarted four planned terror attacks in the Netherlands since late 2011, the country’s intelligence agency said today. The country’s top spy chief, Rob Bertholee, told the NOS broadcaster late yesterday that he could say his service had recently foiled “two to three” attacks, but then agreed that since he took up his post in December 2011 the force had averted three to four terror-related plots. A spokesman for the intelligence and security agency AIVD told AFP it was four plots that had been uncovered in the past few years. “It is of course an issue of definition,” added spokesman Hilbert Bredemeijer. Bertholee told NOS he could “dare to say that we have prevented an attack,” mentioning the case of a Dutch citizen jailed for four years in November for preparing a terror strike. The man was arrested in 2016, after police discovered an assault rifle and a large amount of fireworks in his Rotterdam apartment. Asked by NOS how many plots had been detected, Bertholee said “recently there have been two or three which I cannot divulge because some of them are still being dealt with and are still before the courts”. He said sometimes it was only “with hindsight” that it was possible to say whether an arrest had been terror-related. The Netherlands has so far been spared from the assaults by Islamic jihadists which have rocked its neighbours in recent years, including France, Belgium and Britain. But amid a number of scares, and reports that people linked to some of those attacks may have crossed briefly into the country, Dutch security and intelligence officials have been on high alert. “The main thing which is complicated here is that we are obviously investigating something which may happen,” Bertholee added in the extract of his interview. The full interview will be broadcast on NOS on January 21. On Christmas Eve, Dutch police arrested four men including a Swedish citizen on suspicion of being involved in terror-related activities. In another scare, Dutch military police shot and wounded a man armed with a knife at Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport causing panic among travellers in mid-December. But the authorities said the man was “confused” and the incident was not terror-related."
Knife-wielding man attacks police in Jambi," A man attacked personnel at a police station in Muarojambi regency in Jambi on Tuesday. Two policemen, identified as Adj. Second Insp. Manalu and Chief Brig. Sangab Tinambunan, were wounded in the attack. The attack took place at 2 p.m. when a man riding a motorcycle parked his vehicle in front of the Marosebo Police station, vandalized a police car and attacked the officers. The attacker, identified as SD, 34, is now being interrogated, Jambi Police chief Brig. Gen. Muchlis AS said. The police suspected that other people might have assisted SD in carrying out the attack, but the police have yet to conclude if the attack was terror related. "
Three arrested over alleged Melbourne terror plot,"MELBOURNE — Three men who allegedly plotted ""chilling"" terror attacks in Melbourne were arrested early Tuesday, less than two weeks after a stabbing rampage inspired by the Islamic State group left two dead in Australia’s second city, police said. The trio, all Australian nationals of Turkish descent, were detained by counter-terror police in overnight raids as they escalated preparations to attack crowded areas of Melbourne, according to police. The men were ""certainly inspired by ISIS"", the Islamic State group, but had no known links to a specific organisation, Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton said. The three, who were not named but included two brothers, had been under investigation since March but had become ""more energised"" since the IS-inspired stabbing attack in Melbourne on November 9, Ashton said. The men had sought to purchase semi-automatic .22 calibre rifles and police were concerned they could target upcoming Christmas season events that will see huge crowds gathering in the city. ""There was a view towards a crowded place, a place where maximum people would be attending, to be able to kill, we allege, as maximum an amount of people as possible,"" Ashton told reporters. The group had not yet picked a specific target or time for the attack, and Ashton added that police were confident Tuesday’s arrests had ""neutralised any threat to the... community from this group"". In the November 9 attack, a Somali-born Australian, Hassan Khalif Shire Ali, stabbed and killed one man and wounded two others in a central shopping area before being shot dead by police. Coincidentally, the victim of that attack, Sisto Malaspina, 74, was honoured by a state funeral in Melbourne on Tuesday. Hundreds of Melbournians and dignitaries attended a service at Melbourne’s St Patrick’s Cathedral to bid farewell to Malaspina, the beloved owner of a local Italian cafe and a well-known figure on the city’s vibrant restaurant scene. The three arrested men were aged 30, 26 and 21, and will be charged in a Melbourne court later in the day with terrorism-related offences that carry a potential penalty of life in prison, police said. ""If we had not acted early in preventing this attack, we’ll allege the consequences would have been chilling, with... a potential significant loss of human life,"" said Ian Mccartney, a federal counter-terror police spokesman. Australian police have charged 90 people in relation to 40 counter-terrorism investigations since 2014, when the country’s terror alert level was raised to ""probable"". Melbourne has been the target for a number of attacks and plots. In addition to the November 9 knife rampage, a 28-year-old man was convicted on six counts of murder last week for mowing down dozens of people in the same street in January 2017, and another man is in jail awaiting trial for a plot to cause mass casualties in the city’s Federation Square. Shire Ali, like the three men arrested Tuesday, had his passport cancelled to keep him from joining ISIS in the Mideast, and Ashton said this may have led to their actions at home. ""Unfortunately, the ISIS propaganda machine and that of al-Qaeda promotes this type of activity so when people are prevented from travelling or it’s difficult to get to the conflict zone, often the view will be to change tack and commit an act in the country in which they live,"" he said. Police said the probe which led to Tuesday’s arrests had been complicated by their use of encrypted messaging applications, an element certain to fuel debate about government attempts to force device makers and telecom companies to grant access to the applications.

Terror attacker was ‘inspired by Islamic State’,"Sydney?A Somali-born Australian who went on a deadly knife rampage in the country’s second-largest city of Melbourne was inspired by Islamic State but did not have a direct link to the jihadist group, the government said Sunday. Hassan Khalif Shire Ali stabbed to death well-known local cafe co-owner Sisto Malaspina and injured two other men in Bourke Street in the heart of Melbourne on Friday afternoon before he was shot and killed by police. The 30-year-old had gone to the bustling city in a utility vehicle filled with gas cylinders before setting it alight. Islamic State said via its propaganda arm that Shire Ali was an “Islamic State fighter and carried out the operation”, but provided no evidence to back its claim. “In relation to his connections with ISIL (another name for IS) or with any terrorist group... there’s not, as I’m advised, a membership of an organization or a definite link to ISIL,” Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton told reporters in Brisbane. “The working theory is at the moment a case where this person has been downloading information or receiving messages in his own mind about what he should be doing. It’s inspired as opposed to affiliation or membership.” Shire Ali, known to the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO), had his passport revoked in 2015 on fears he was trying to travel to Syria to join IS. But he was also assessed by authorities as not being a domestic threat. Dutton defended the actions of ASIO, saying they had more than 400 investigations and people of interest to monitor.“Police did not have intelligence in relation to this person that he was about to commit an act,” he added. “The fact is that many people, particularly where there is a low level of sophistication, where you have someone who can grab a knife from a kitchen drawer... it is impossible for authorities to cover every one of those circumstances.” Dutton’s comments came as Melbourne’s Herald Sun reported Sunday that Shire Ali had drug and alcohol problems, and had split from his wife and become distanced from his family. Melbourne’s The Age raised questions about his mental health, quoting a local imam as saying Shire Ali told him he was being “chased by unseen people with spears”. Meanwhile more than Aus$50,000 (US$36,000) has been raised on GoFundMe for a bystander dubbed “trolley man”, who was hailed as a hero for trying to stop Shire Ali by knocking him over with a shopping cart. The man, named in local media as Michael Rogers, is homeless according to the GoFundMe page creators. Authorities say more than a dozen terrorist attacks have been prevented in recent years, but several have taken place, including a cafe siege in Sydney in 2014 where two hostages were killed. Shire Ali’s brother will go on trial next year on separate terror-related charges?accused of trying to acquire a firearm and kill people in a New Years’ Eve crowd."
"Melbourne knife attacker inspired by Islamic State, police say","MELBOURNE: A Somali-born man who set fire to a truck laden with gas cylinders in the centre of Melbourne and fatally stabbed one person was inspired by Islamic State but did not have direct links with the group, Australian police said on Saturday. Police identified the man responsible for Friday's attack as 30-year-old Hassan Khalif Shire Ali and said he was radicalised and inspired by the militant group's propaganda. He was shot by police and died in hospital. Police said Shire Ali's Australian passport was cancelled in 2015 after an intelligence report he planned to travel to Syria, but an assessment was made that while he had radical views, he posed no threat to national security. Islamic State had claimed responsibility for the attack, which came two days before Remembrance Day, marking 100 years since the end of World War One, without providing any evidence. ""I think it is fair to say he (Shire Ali) was inspired. He was radicalised,"" Australian Federal Police Acting Deputy Commissioner Ian McCartney told reporters in Melbourne. ""We're not saying there was direct contact. We're saying it was more from an inspiration perspective."" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the national terrorism advisory remained at ""probable"", the midpoint of a five-tier system, and told reporters in Sydney that radical Islam was the issue. ""I need to call it out. Radical, violent, extremist Islam that opposes our very way of life. I am the first to protect religious freedom in this country, but that also means I must be the first to call out religious extremism,"" he said. Friday's attack began just before the evening rush hour and lasted only minutes. Shire Ali stabbed bystanders and attacked police while his utility truck carrying barbecue gas cylinders burned on busy Bourke Street, (https://tmsnrt.rs/2Qu5stX) The cylinders did not explode and the fire was put out in 10 minutes, by which point the attack was over, though not before one man was fatally stabbed. Police said he was a 74-year-old man who worked in the city, but did not release his name. Local media identified him as a restaurant owner. ""This shouldn't happen in a city like Melbourne,"" one witness who had returned to the scene on Saturday told Reuters, crying. ""I just want to forget it,"" she said. Video posted to Twitter and broadcast on television showed Shire Ali swinging a knife at two police officers, while the truck burned in the background, before he collapsed when one shot him in the chest. Victoria state police said counter-terrorism investigators were searching two properties in suburban Melbourne in connection with the attack, but there was no immediate word on what the searches yielded. At one, a modest one-storey brick house on the city's western fringe, armed officers wearing masks stood guard outside. Bourke Street also reopened on Saturday morning, and a Reuters reporter said there was an increased police presence in the area. A staunch U.S. ally, Australia has been on alert for such violence after a Sydney cafe siege in 2014, and its intelligence agencies have stepped up scrutiny. Victoria Police Commissioner Graham Ashton said there was no warning of the latest attack. He said there was no longer a threat to the public, but that security would be boosted at horse races and Remembrance Day memorials over the weekend. Authorities say Australia's vigilance has helped foil at least a dozen plots, including a plan to attack Melbourne at Christmas in 2016 and a plan to blow up a flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi using a bomb disguised as a meat mincer. Two hostages were killed during the 17-hour Sydney cafe siege by a ""lone wolf"" gunman who was inspired by Islamic State militants."
Paris knife attacker ‘born in Chechnya’," PARIS?A knife-wielding man who killed a man and wounded four other people in a suspected terror attack in central Paris was born in Chechnya and his parents have been taken into custody, a judicial source said on Sunday. The young Frenchman, born in 1997 in the southern Russian republic according to the source, was shot dead by police after carrying out the assault on Saturday evening near the city’s main opera house. “He had no judicial record,” the judicial source told AFP. “[The attacker] is French, born in Chechnya in 1997. His father and mother were placed in custody Sunday morning.” Witnesses said they heard the attacker shout “Allahu akbar” (God is great) as Parisians fled into restaurants and bars after realizing another possible terror attack was underway in a country already reeling from a string of jihadist assaults that have killed more than 245 people in the last three years. “I was taking orders and I saw a young woman trying to get into the restaurant in panic,” Jonathan, a waiter at a Korean restaurant, told AFP. The woman was bleeding and a young man fended off the attacker who then ran away, he said. “The attacker entered a shopping street, I saw him with a knife in his hand,” he said. “He looked crazy.” Milan, 19, said he saw “several people in distress” including a woman with wounds to her neck and leg. “Firemen were giving her first aid. I heard two, three shots and a policeman told me that the man had been overpowered.” French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted: “France has once again paid the price in blood but will not give an inch to the enemies of freedom.” Authorities said a 29-year-old man was killed in the attack and that a terror investigation had been launched. The assailant had no identifying documents on him. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility, saying one of its “soldiers” had carried out the attack, according to the SITE monitoring group, but provided no corroborating proof to back their assertion. Two of those wounded, a 34-year-old man and a 54-year-old woman, were rushed to hospital in a serious condition but Interior Minister Gerard Collomb later told reporters all the injured would survive. “I have just seen the person who was most seriously injured, she is better, she is saved,” he said.French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said police were on the scene “within five minutes” of the attack and that some nine minutes later the assailant was dead, he added. “The speed of the response obviously avoided a heavier toll,” he said. A police source told AFP one officer tried to restrain the attacker with a taser but when that failed a colleague shot the man dead. The attack took place on Rue Monsigny in the second arrondissement, an area that lies between the main opera house and the Louvre museum, two major tourist attractions. Shocked tourists and residents looked on from behind a security perimeter set up by the police. “I was on the cafe terrace, I heard three, four shots, it happened very fast,” said 47-year-old Gloria. “The bartenders told us to come inside very quickly. Then I went out to see what was going on, and then I saw a man on the ground,” she added. One witness, who gave her first name as Maxine, said panic spread as word got out that an attack was taking place. “We saw someone coming out of a building who said he saw the assailant slaughter someone, so people took refuge in the bar,” she said. France has suffered a series of major Islamist attacks including the massacre at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, the November 2015 attacks that killed 130 in Paris, and the 2016 Bastille Day truck attack in Nice that killed more than 80. There have also been a string of less deadly but frequent attacks by lone wolf jihadists wielding knives or guns. Most of the attacks have either been claimed by the Islamic State group or been carried out in their name. A state of emergency put in place just after the 2015 Paris attacks was lifted in October when Macron’s centrist government passed a new law boosting the powers of security forces. Thousands of French troops remain on the streets under an anti-terror operation known as Sentinelle, patrolling transport hubs, tourist hot spots and other sensitive sites."
Finland knife attacker says he was ‘in war against women’,"HELSINKI, April 17 — A Moroccan man told a court in Finland he was “in war against women” when he went on a rampage in the Finnish city of Turku last year, stabbing two women to death and wounding eight more people, local media reported. Abderrahman Bouanane, at the time a 22-year-old asylum seeker, spoke in district court today, where he is on trial on charges of murder and attempted murder “with terrorist intent”. Bouanane told the court that before the attacks last August, he had visited mosque and recorded a video in which he talked about US-led air strikes in Syria and the fight for Islamic State. When he started the attacks on the market square, he said, he couldn’t control himself. “I honestly felt like I was controlled remotely... The idea was to keep attacking as long as a head falls,” Bouanane said via an interpreter, according to the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat’s online edition. Two women were killed and six more women were injured. Two men were hurt when they tried to help the women. Police stopped the attacks by shooting Bouanane in the leg. A psychiatric assessment concluded that Bouanane was criminally responsible for the attacks. Police said he was a “lone wolf” who saw himself as a soldier for Islamic State. The militant group did not take responsibility for the attack. “My target was to hit women, not men... I was in war against women,” Bouanane said, according to Helsingin Sanomat. The hearing was broke off today when Bouanane suddenly declined to sit in his chair or stand, without giving a clear reason. Bouanane had been radicalised shortly before the attack, police investigation showed, and his application for asylum had just been rejected. The case marks the first terror-related attack in Finland. The prosecutor is seeking a life sentence, which in Finland means at least 12 years in prison. Bouanane has admitted the attacks, but his defence has denied terrorist intent, according to the definition in Finnish law."
"Australia PM, Muslim leaders spar over his terror comments","Australian Muslim leaders said Wednesday they would boycott a meeting with Prime Minister Scott Morrison after he said they needed to do more to halt terror attacks in the country. Morrison singled out Muslim community leaders as having a ""special responsibility"" to counter ""the radical and dangerous ideology of extremist Islam"" following a terror attack in Melbourne earlier this month that left two dead. ""They must be proactive, they must be alert and they must call this out,"" Morrison said, adding that he would hold a roundtable meeting with Muslim leaders this week to discuss the problem. But Australian Grand Mufti Ibrahim Abu Mohamed and a group of other senior Muslim figures rejected the invitation in an open letter to Morrison Wednesday. The men said they were ""deeply concerned and disappointed"" with comments by Morrison and other ministers ""which infer that the community is collectively culpable for the criminal actions of individuals and should be doing more to prevent such acts of violence"". ""These statements have achieved nothing to address underlying issues, but rather, have alienated large segments of the Muslim community,"" they said in the letter, which was published by Australian media. The letter prompted a tweetstorm from Morrison, who accused those behind the boycott of ""continuing down a path of denial"" and making their communities ""less safe and more vulnerable"". ""We all have responsibilities to make Australia safe, and that means making sure Muslim communities do not become infiltrated with this dangerous ideology,"" he tweeted. In the November 9 attack in Melbourne, a Somali-born man who police said was inspired by the so-called Islamic State, stabbed and killed one man and wounded two others before being fatally shot by police. And this week police arrested three more men in Melbourne for allegedly plotting another IS-inspired attack on the city -- the 15th terror attack authorities say they have thwarted since 2014. The terror threat has fuelled calls from some conservatives for a further toughening of Australia's already tight immigration laws, raising concerns among the Muslim community. In their letter the Islamic leaders, who head community groups in several Australian states, said they would attend a later meeting with Morrison if their ""views and concerns will be genuinely respected""."
Three men found guilty of Australia Christmas terror plot,"SYDNEY, Nov 14 — Three young men have been found guilty of plotting terror attacks in Australia’s second-largest city, intending to inflict mass casualties during the Christmas festive season. The court was told the men—Hamza Abbas, 23, Ahmed Mohamed, 25 and Abdullah Chaarani, 27 -- bought machetes and ingredients to make homemade bombs, and wanted to target major Melbourne sites including a train station and a church. The verdict came as Australians were reeling from last Friday’s Islamic State-inspired knife attack and attempted car bombing in Melbourne, which left two dead including the attacker. Hamza Abbas’ older brother Ibrahim Abbas pleaded guilty earlier this year to the Christmas plot, which was to be carried out in December 2016. The Supreme Court of Victoria jury decision was handed down in early November but only permitted to be published Wednesday after the lifting of suppression orders. Ibrahim Abbas had told the court he “wanted to make sure that the casualties would be high”, Melbourne’s Herald Sun reported. “The bigger the better. The bigger the more terror is achieved, and that’s the point.” Police uncovered the plot after monitoring the Australian-born men’s phone conversations, text messages and emails, and all four were arrested on December 22, 2016. Prosecutors had also alleged a link to the Al-Qaeda magazine Inspire’s article “How to make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom”, which was found on one of the men’s phones. Then Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called their plans “one of the most substantial terrorist plots that have been disrupted over the last several years”. Authorities say more than a dozen terrorist attacks have been prevented in recent years, but several have taken place, including a cafe siege in Sydney in 2014 where two hostages were killed. The men are due to be sentenced at a later date, and face life imprisonment."
Cash pours in for homeless ‘trolley man’ who battled terror attacker," MELBOURNE, Nov 12 — Donations poured in this morning for a homeless man dubbed “trolleyman” for his attempt to use a shopping cart to halt last week’s deadly lone wolf terror attack in Melbourne. An online GoFundMe campaign set up to help Michael Rogers after video of his bid to stop Friday’s attack went viral surged past A$100,000 (RM301,248) this morning, more than double the target of A$45,000. As of early this morning, A$104,790 had been contributed to the fund by more than 3,700 people. “I was scared, I was scared for myself,” Rogers told Channel Seven television following the incident, when Hassan Khalif Shire Ali went on a stabbing rampage in central Melbourne, killing one man and wounding two others before being fatally shot by police. Video taken by passers-by shows Rogers repeatedly pushing a metal shopping cart toward Shire Ali as he wielded his knife against two policemen trying to subdue him. “I have seen the trolley to the side, so I’ve picked it up and I ran and threw the trolley straight at him,” Rogers said. “I did that motion ... quite a number of times, but it just wasn’t getting him down.” Rogers insisted he was “not a hero, but I feel that I’ve probably saved some lives, maybe.” Police said Shire Ali, a 30-year-old Somalia-born Australian, was inspired by the so-called Islamic State, but did not have a direct link to the jihadist group and seems to have acted on his own.

23 suspects of surabaya church bombing moved to Jakarta: Police,"Surabaya, E Java (ANTARA News) - Twenty three suspects of a church bombing in Surabaya have been moved from East Java city to the National Police headquarters` jail in Jakarta for an investigation, a police spokesman said. ""The suspects had been transported to Jakarta on Monday,"" the East Java police spokesman, Sen. Coms. Frans Barung Mangera, said here on Tuesday. Seventeen of the 23 suspects were jailed in the East Java provincial police detention house, while six others were detained in the prison of Dukuh Pakis police in Surabaya, he said, adding that they were transported to Jakarta in two buses. Arrested by the National Police anti-terrorist squad, Densus 88, the suspects would be tried in Surabaya because the attack occurred in the capital city of East Java Province, he said. The Surabaya church bombing occurred last May where the executor was a woman who engaged her two children. The three of them blew themselves up in the yard of the targeted church. The spread of radicalism and terrorism still threatens Indonesia, and the empowerment of women is believed to be an important element for resolving serious threats due to women`s strategic roles. It was Yenny Wahid, director of the Wahid Institute, who raised the importance of empowering women in the war against terrorism while speaking at the National Gathering of One Thousand Indonesian Women`s Organizations held in Yogyakarta recently. ""How do we feel when we see a mother have no heart and blow up herself and her two children? On the contrary, if our kids happen to even slip, we get sad. But the mother did it because her husband wanted them all to go to heaven. If she was strong, she would definitely be able to reject a doctrine that she would only go to paradise through her husband or her father,"" Wahid said. Indonesian women should be empowered enough to refuse such a misleading doctrine because each man and woman must be responsible for whatever he/she has done. ""The main task of a parent is to educate his or her children but if they have grown up and become adults, all the sins they commit are not the responsibility of the parents but their own."" ""What a pity if the parents of corruptors, criminals, and other bad people are held responsible for the sins of their children,"" Wahid said."
"British, Egyptian tourists among 7 wounded in Paris knife attack","PARIS • A man wielding a knife and an iron bar injured seven people, including three tourists, in Paris, in an attack that bystanders tried to stop by throwing petanque balls at the assailant. Four of the victims were in a critical condition, police said, after the man, believed to be an Afghan national, went on the rampage next to a canal in the north-east of the capital on Sunday evening. Two British tourists, an Egyptian tourist and a local man were among the injured, police added. The suspect, believed to be in his 30s, had been overpowered by bystanders and was unconscious when officers arrived on the scene and took him to hospital, police said. A source close to the inquiry added that though he had targeted foreigners, ""nothing at this stage suggests a terrorist attack"". Chaos erupted on the banks of the Bassin de la Villette, an area popular with locals and visitors, who frequent the cafes, cinemas and other cultural venues along its banks, just after 11pm local time. Eyewitness Youssef Najah, 28, said he was walking beside the canal when he saw a man running and holding a knife about 25-30cm long. ""There were around 20 people chasing him. They started throwing petanque balls at him,"" Mr Najah said, referring to the sport popular in France also known as boules. ""Around four or five balls hit him in the head, but they weren't able to stop him,"" he added. According to the same witness, the attacker then dived into an alleyway, where the man ""tried to hide behind two British tourists. We said to them: 'Watch out, he has a knife.' But they didn't react"". The pair, said by police to be in their 50s, were then attacked, he said. A security guard at one of two cinemas there said he had seen the attacker running away from two men who were trying to stop him.

The authorities said the 36-year-old had serious mental health problems and had been on a terror watch list since 2016. That attack came days after an Afghan asylum seeker was arrested in the south-western town of Perigueux for a drunken rampage with a knife in which four people were wounded. Police said investigators had ""very quickly"" dismissed a terrorist motive after the Aug 13 incident.

"Knife attack near Paris leaves two dead, one injured","PARIS • A man stabbed his mother and sister to death and seriously injured another person in a town near Paris yesterday before being shot dead by police. The killer had serious mental health problems and had been on a terror watch list since 2016, French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told reporters after visiting the scene in the town of Trappes. The motive for the violence remained unclear despite a claim by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group that it was an attack by one of its fighters responding to the terror organisation's propaganda. Mr Collomb said the attacker was ""mentally unstable, rather than someone who was committed, who would respond to orders from a terrorist organisation, in particular Daesh"", another name for ISIS. Regular French criminal prosecutors are investigating the case rather than anti-terror specialists, Mr Collomb stressed, although checks on the attacker's phone and computer were under way. ISIS claimed ""the person who carried out the attack in Trappes, south-west of Paris, was an Islamic State fighter"". ""He carried out the attack in response to calls to target subjects of the countries of the coalition"" fighting ISIS, said a statement on its propaganda channel Amaq. The leader of the extremist group Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had called on Muslims to wage ""jihad"" in a purported new audio recording released on Wednesday, in which he also called for attacks in the West. Experts have urged caution about recent ISIS announcements because it has lost credibility after claiming responsibility for seemingly unrelated violence as it faces defeat in the Middle East. The attacker in Trappes had been on the terror watch list after expressing extremist views, a security source told AFP. BFM television reported that he had serious alcohol and drug problems. Armed police responded to reports of violence and were threatened by the man who stabbed his mother to death in her home, said Mr Collomb. ""He walked towards the police with his knife,"" he said. ""Police then opened fire."" The assailant has not yet been named. Trappes, with a population of about 30,000, is known for its social problems linked to poverty, gangs and hardline interpretations of Islam. About 50 locals are suspected of having left France to fight for ISIS in Syria and Iraq, French security sources had previously told AFP. France remains on high alert after a string of militant attacks since 2015 that have claimed the lives of more than 240 victims. Baghdadi's Telegram message on Eid al-Adha, the Islamic festival of sacrifice, was the first purported recording of the ISIS leader to be released since last September. ISIS overran large swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq in 2014, proclaiming a ""caliphate"" in areas it controlled. But it has since lost most of that to various offensives in both countries. The ""caliphate will remain, God willing"", Baghdadi said in Wednesday's recording, addressing followers in the Middle East, Asia and Africa. It was not clear when the message was recorded, but Baghdadi appeared to criticise a US$100 million (S$137 million) pledge by Saudi Arabia last week to help rebuild Syria's north-east. He threatened the US and Russia, which have both backed offensives against ISIS, saying that militants had prepared ""horrors"" for them. The ISIS chief made his only known public appearance in Iraq's second city of Mosul in July 2014. Baghdadi has been dubbed the ""most wanted man on the planet"" and the US is offering a US$25 million reward for his capture."
Finland jails asylum seeker for life over country's first terror attack," HELSINKI (AFP) - A Finnish court on Friday (June 15) sentenced a Moroccan asylum seeker to life in prison over what was described as the nation's first terror attack after he killed two women and injured eight others in a stabbing spree last year. The district court of South-western Finland found Abderrahman Bouanane guilty of two murders and eight attempted murders ""with terrorist intent"" in the southern Finnish city of Turku on the afternoon of August 18, 2017. The court said in its verdict that the 23-year-old swore allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria group (ISIS) in a video uploaded the night before the attack at a market place. The extremist group never claimed responsibility for the assault. Police shot the rejected asylum seeker in the thigh minutes after the attack at another square nearby, arresting him and confiscating his knife. The murders ""were strongly premeditated and committed in a particularly brutal and cruel way"", the court said, adding Bouanane ""was about to cut off the victim's head"". Authorities said he targeted women in the attack. Six of the total injured were women, while two men were wounded when they tried to fend off the attacker. Bouanane, who confessed to the killings, has 30 days to appeal the verdict. A life term in Finland averages 14 years, although the longest prison term has been 22 years. The court also ordered Bouanane to pay compensation to the survivors and to the victims' families, totalling more than 470,000 euros (US$546,000)."
"Belgian police-killer had history of violence, petty crime","BRUSSELS, May 30 — Benjamin Herman, who shot three people dead in a suspected terror attack in eastern Belgium, was a serial petty criminal with a drug problem who may have been radicalised in prison. The 31-year-old Belgian was known to police since adolescence and had been in and out of prison for robbery and drug offences. Local media have portrayed him as a violent and unstable man. He is thought to have converted to Islam in prison but questions remain over whether he became radicalised there and whether this was what drove him to carry out his murderous rampage. “He converted to the Muslim religion in 2012 while meeting with another prisoner in Arlon,” a town in southern Belgium near Luxembourg, Justice Minister Koen Geens told broadcaster RTBF. But both Geens and Interior Minister Jan Jambon, interviewed on Belgium’s RTL channel, were cautious about whether he had embraced Islamist militant ideology before launching his attack. “The fact he took part in a prayer group, for example, is it a sufficient sign of radicalisation to treat him as a dangerous terrorist?” Geens asked. “We may have been mistaken, but the response was negative,” Geens added. “There were signs of radicalisation in prison but did this radicalisation lead to these actions? There, too, we can ask ourselves questions,” Jambon said. “We must wait for the results of the investigation.” Herman’s name appeared in police and state security reports about radicals, though he was not the subject of the reports. Prosecutors say they are treating the case as “terrorist murder and attempted terrorist murder”. That was partly because the method  of his attack has been advocated in online videos by the Islamic State group. Herman attacked police officers with a knife before taking their guns to shoot people. Alain Grignard, a Belgian Islamic studies expert at the University of Liege, said Herman appeared to be a “criminal who converted”. “People want labels that are too clear: ‘delinquent’, ‘terrorist’. The reality is between the two,” Grignard said. Herman’s first brush with the law was in 2003 when, aged 16, he was placed for several weeks in a juvenile home in the Flemish region of Everberg. Herman and his brother were both reported to be cocaine and heroin addicts. “Every day they hunted for money to get their fix,” the newspaper La Meuse reported. Herman was granted temporary release from prison on Monday morning for “family leave”. He embarked on his deadly spree instead of returning on Tuesday evening. In a separate investigation, prosecutors also suspect Herman killed another man on the eve of his rampage. Analysts say a high number of jihadists had trouble with the law before being radicalised. They include several involved in the November 2015 attacks in Paris and the March 2016 Brussels suicide bombings."
Psychiatrists to assess Jambi Police attacker," Authorities are examining the mental state of a man who attacked officers with a knife at the Marosebo Police station in Jambi province on Tuesday evening. Anwar Sadat, 35, is being assessed by psychiatrists at the Jambi Regional Mental Health Hospital (RSJD), according to Jambi Police spokesperson Adj.Sr.Comr. Kuswahyudi Tresnadi. ""We believe that [Anwar] may be suffering from mental health issues, so we need to involve psychiatrists in our investigation,” he said on Wednesday, adding that the suspect was still being questioned. Preliminary investigations suggest that Anwar carried out the attack alone. ""He is the single perpetrator. Motives behind the attack are being investigated. [Anwar] has remained silent,"" Kuswahyudi said. Anwar is currently being detained at the Jambi Police's Mobile Brigade (Brimob) headquarters. According to police findings, he is unemployed but investigators have yet to discover whether he has been involved in other crimes. Meanwhile, Adj. Second Insp. Manalu and Chief Brig. Sangap Tinambunan who were wounded in the attack, are still being treated at the Jambi Bhayangkara Police Hospital. Both sustained stab wounds to the neck and hands, but their conditions are improving. Anwar arrived at the Marosebo Police station by motorcycle at 2 p.m. on Tuesday, then vandalized a police car before attacking officers. "
Suspected terror attack in France foiled," PARIS (AFP) - Police in France have foiled a suspected terror attack and arrested two brothers of Egyptian origin, French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said on Friday (May 18). ""There were two young people of Egyptian origin who were preparing to commit an attack, with either explosives or ricin, this very powerful poison,"" the minister said on BFMTV. ""They had tutorials that showed how to make ricin-based poisons,"" Mr Collomb said, adding that they had communicated via the Telecom encrypted messaging app. The revelation came after a 29-year-old man was killed and five other people injured in a deadly knife attack in Paris last Saturday night. Mr Collomb did not indicate when they were arrested, but a source close to the inquiry said they were detained in the northern 18th Arrondissement of Paris on May 11, the day before Khamzat Azimov carried out his knife rampage. One of the men ""admitted having wanted to stage an attack"", the source told AFP. Azimov also lived in the 18th Arrondissement, parts of which are packed with low-income high-rises and a mix of French and immigrant communities. In late March, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe had indicated that a total of 51 attacks had been thwarted by French security services since January 2015, the beginning of a wave of strikes on French soil, many claimed by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group. A total of 246 people have been killed in attacks since then."
"Friend of Paris knife attacker charged, two women held","PARIS (AFP) - A friend of the man who carried out a deadly knife attack in Paris was charged on Thursday (May 17) with ""associating with criminal terrorists"", while two women were detained for questioning as the investigation gathers speed. Khamzat Azimov, a 20-year-old naturalised Frenchman of Chechen origin, killed one man and injured five others in the busy Opera district of the French capital on Saturday night before being shot dead by police. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group has claimed the attack. Abdul Hakim A, also a Chechen-born French national, was detained on Sunday in the eastern city of Strasbourg, where the two men grew up, and charged with ""associating with criminal terrorists with plans to attack people"", a judicial source said. Both men, who were close friends, had appeared on French terror watch lists, although neither had a prior criminal record. ""He has denied any implication in either preparing or carrying out the acts as well as any recent links with Khamzat Azimov, claiming not to have seen or been in contact with him for several months,"" France's top anti-terror prosecutor Francois Molins said. But he added that examinations of telephone networks showed that shortly before the attack, Hakim A has sent his sister a text message of ""a jihadist chant regularly used by the Islamic State (in Iraq and Syria)"". Investigators want to determine if Hakim A ""may have influenced Azimov in his jihadist quest or knew he was planning this attack"", the source said. During a search of his home in Strasbourg, police found seven cellphones, but were unable to locate the phone he used most often, sources close to the case said. ""This telephone, he probably threw it away. He told investigators that he had gone to the gym and lost it there,"" Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told RTL radio on Wednesday. Mr Molins confirmed that two women were detained for questioning on Thursday in connection with the attack. Mr Molins said he did not want to give more details of the two women for now, but a source close to the inquiry said one was Ines Hamza, a radicalised 19-year-old who married Hakim A before trying to leave for Syria in January 2017. Witnesses said Azimov yelled ""Allahu akbar"" (God is greatest) during the rampage, for which the ISIS group has claimed responsibility, later releasing a video purporting to show Azimov pledging allegiance to the Islamists. Interior Minister Collomb said that Azimov had carried out his attack ""with one of his mother's kitchen knives"". Azimov's parents were released from custody on Tuesday after investigators found no incriminating elements during questioning. The attack brings to 246 the number of victims from a string of apparent Islamist strikes against French targets since 2015."
Three terror suspects from Probolinggo involved in Surabaya-Sidoarjo bombing attacks,"Probolinggo, E Java (ANTARA News) - Three terror suspects arrested by the Anti-Terror Special Detachment (Densus) 88 of the Indonesian Police were allegedly involved in the bombing attacks in Surabaya and Sidoarjo, both in East Java Province. Tens of Densus 88 personnel and Probolinggo Police raided three houses located in Wonoasih Sub-district in Probolinggo on Wednesday. ""Three male terror suspects identified by their initials as F, S, and H were arrested for interrogation,"" Head of the Probolinggo Police Adjunct Senior Commissioner Alfian Nurrizal informed the press here, Thursday. No violence broke out, as the three men did not resist arrest, he added. Several items seized during the raids at the three houses included guns, an arrow, a knife, machetes, books on jihad, communication devices, and electronic assemblies, he noted. The three suspects were taken to the Indonesian Police Headquarters in Jakarta for further investigation. Earlier, a series of bomb attacks hit three churches, a city police station in Surabaya, and a flat in Sidoarjo, East Java, on Sunday and Monday, killing at least 18 people and injuring dozens. In Riau Province, the police confirmed that they had shot dead four terrorists attempting to attack the Riau Police Headquarters in the provincial capital of Pekanbaru on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the Indonesian Police Headquarters has involved the Army`s Special Elite Force (Kopassus) in combating terrorism in the country. ""Kopassus has been involved in it (counter-terrorism),"" Chief of the Public Relations Division at the National Police Headquarters Inspector General Setyo Wasisto stated on Wednesday. Wasisto noted that Chief of the National Police General Tito Karnavian has confirmed the involvement of Kopassus in counterterrorism efforts. The National Police`s Mobile Brigade has been cooperating with Kopassus in maintaining security when an anti-terror squad raids a terrorist cell."
Pontianak airport beefs up security after terror attacks," The authorities at Supadio International Airport in Pontianak, West Kalimantan, have beefed up security, announcing the highest alert status, siaga I, in response to terror attacks in Surabaya, East Java, and Pekanbaru in Riau.

"Police detain more families linked to Surabaya, Sidoarjo bombings","Counterterrorism squad Densus 88 raided on Tuesday evening the residences of terror suspects believed to be linked to the recent bombings in Surabaya and Sidoarjo, East Java.  One suspect was killed during the raid, while two families comprising nine people were detained for further questioning. The police sought to apprehend Dedy Sulistiantono at his residence on Jl. Sikatan IV, Tandes, Surabaya. He is the younger brother of terror suspect Anton Ferdiantono whose wife and eldest son were killed after a bomb went off prematurely at his low-cost apartment in Wonocolo, Sidoarjo. Dedy, however, was shot dead after resisting arrest by attacking the officers with a knife. “We have detained [Dedy’s] wife and four children [for further investigation],” East Java Police spokesman Sr. Comr.

Parents of Paris knife attacker let out of custody," PARIS (AFP) - French authorities released the parents of Paris knife attacker Khamzat Azimov from custody on Tuesday (May 15), while keeping his closest friend in detention, a judicial source said. Azimov, a naturalised French citizen of Chechen origin who had lived in Strasbourg, was shot dead by police on Saturday night after stabbing a 29-year-old man to death in the Opera district of Paris and wounding four others in an assault claimed by the Islamic State group. Azimov's parents were detained on Sunday morning. An apartment that his parents had rented in Paris was also searched. The attacker's close friend, named as Abdoul Hakim A., a 20-year-old of Chechen origin from Strasbourg, was retained in custody until Thursday. He was arrested by heavily armed, masked police on Sunday at his home in the eastern city. A source close to the inquiry told AFP he had been under surveillance since marrying Ines Hamza, a woman from the Paris region who tried to leave for Syria in January 2017. Police recovered seven cellphones during a search of his home but were unable to locate the main phone he used most often. Saturday's knife rampage followed a series of jihadist assaults that have now claimed 246 lives in France since 2015, including the Paris attacks of that year and the truck-ramming attack targeting Bastille Day revellers in Nice in 2016. A former student in Strasbourg told AFP that Azimov and Hakim A. were in the same class during their final year, ""and were very good friends, both Chechen - they were always together, both in school and outside."" Azimov's family later moved to Paris, where they were renting rooms in the 18th arrondissement. Azimov had been on both of France's main watchlists for suspected radicals since 2016 - the so-called ""S file"" and a more targeted File for the Prevention of Terrorist Radicalisation (FSPRT), which focuses on people judged to be terror threats. The government has come under fire over the fact that Azimov had been flagged as a suspected extremist, just the same as several others behind deadly attacks including the brothers who carried out the Charlie Hebdo gun massacre in 2015. Azimov became a French citizen in 2010 after his mother was naturalised. Hundreds of fighters from Chechnya have joined Islamist militant groups in recent years, following two bloody separatist wars against Russia. Amaq, the ISIS propaganda agency, released a video Sunday in which it claimed responsibility for the attack, with footage claiming to show Azimov pledging allegiance to the jihadist group. In Paris, witnesses said Azimov walked along stabbing people and yelling ""Allahu akbar"" (God is greatest). The seriously injured included a 34-year-old Chinese man who lives in Luxembourg and a 54-year-old woman. Two others were lightly wounded but all four are out of danger. The 29-year-old man who was killed has been identified as Ronan, whose neighbours in Paris's 13th arrondissement posted a letter announcing his death in the hall of their building. Erik Gouenard, a nearby restaurant owner, described him as ""discreet, quiet but always smiling. It was like a smile was part of his DNA."""
Chechnya-born man behind Paris knife attack,"PARIS • Police yesterday scoured the background of a Frenchman born in Russia's Chechnya region who went on a knife attack in central Paris, as the government said the 21-year-old had been flagged previously as a potential security risk. The assailant shouted ""Allahu akbar"" (""God is greatest"") as he stabbed a 29-year-old man to death and wounded four others, among them a Chinese and a Luxembourg citizen, before police shot him dead on Saturday. The attack took place in the busy Opera district, known for its many restaurants, cafes and the Palais Garnier opera. It was one of a succession of attacks in France in which more than 240 people have died since January 2015, keeping the country on high alert. The attacker was named by official sources as Khamzat A. He grew up with his family in the eastern city of Strasbourg, home to a large community of refugees from Chechnya, a Muslim republic. He obtained French citizenship in 2010. Since 2016, he had been on a counter-terrorism watchlist of suspected radicals, said government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux. The stabbing exposed once again the difficulty European intelligence services face in keeping track of suspected extremists and countering the threat posed by home-grown militants and foreign extremists. France is part of a US-led coalition fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and has thousands of soldiers in West Africa, where militants linked to Al-Qaeda are active. French academic Mathieu Guidere, an expert on Islamist terrorism, said the attack could have been planned by Chechen extremists. Over the past 20 years, Russia has fought two fierce wars with separatists in Chechnya, leading to the radicalisation of the territory and beyond. Radical groups see Muslims in the Russian Caucasus and Central Asia, who still face discrimination and harsh treatment by the authorities, as potential recruits. Chechen warlord Akhmed Chatayev, who was killed last year, was believed to be behind a 2016 attack at Istanbul's Ataturk airport in which 45 people died. ""The priority target for Chechens is not Westerners. From this point of view, (the Paris attack) is something of a turning point because up to now, Chechen propaganda has been focused on 'kill all the Russians' rather than 'kill Westerners',"" Mr Guidere told Agence France-Presse. The reprise could be linked ""to (Chechen Islamists') inability to carry out serious actions against the Russians in Syria or Russia, which makes the Islamic State group decide to use them against Westerners instead"", he added. President Emmanuel Macron said France would ""not yield an inch to the enemies of freedom"". A judicial source said the assailant's parents were being held for questioning. Police also arrested and held for questioning a friend of the attacker in Strasbourg. France bears ""full responsibility"" for the knife attack, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said yesterday. He identified the assailant as Hassan Azimov. ""He may have been born in Chechnya, but he grew up and formed his personality, his opinions and convictions within French society,"" said Mr Kadyrov."
Terror cops seek ID of Paris knife attacker," PARIS, May 13 — French investigators scrambled today to identify a knifeman who killed one person and wounded four others in a suspected terror attack that brought panic once more to the streets of Paris. An assailant shouting “Allahu akbar” was shot dead by police in central Paris late yesterday, minutes after he attacked people near the city’s main opera house — an area full of bars, restaurants and theatres which were brimming on a weekend night. Witnesses described scenes of panic as Parisians realised another potential terror attack was underway in a country already reeling from a string of jihadist assaults in the last three years that have killed more than 245 people. “I was taking orders and I saw a young woman trying to get into the restaurant in panic,” Jonathan, a waiter at a Korean restaurant, told AFP. The woman was bleeding and the attacker appeared behind her. He said a young man tried to fend off the assailant who then fled. “The attacker entered a shopping street, I saw him with a knife in his hand,” he said. “He looked crazy.” Milan, 19, said he saw “several people in distress” including a woman with wounds to her neck and leg. “Firemen were giving her first aid. I heard two, three shots and a policeman told me that the man had been overpowered.” In a tweet French President Emmanuel Macron said: “France once again pays the price of blood.” Authorities cited witnesses as saying the man shouted “Allahu akbar” (God is greatest) as he went on the rampage, killing a 29-year-old man, adding that a terror investigation had been launched. The assailant had no identifying documents on him. A source with knowledge of the case told AFP he was a young man with brown hair and a beard who was dressed in black tracksuit trousers. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility, according to the SITE monitoring group, but provided no corroborating proof to back their assertion. “The executor of the stabbing operation in the city of Paris is a soldier of the Islamic State and the operation was carried out in response to the calls to target the coalition states,” a “security source” told IS’s official Amaq news agency, according to SITE. Two of those wounded were rushed to hospital in a serious condition but Interior Minister Gerard Collomb later told reporters all the victims were out of danger and would survive their injuries. “I have just seen the person who was most seriously injured, she is better, she is saved,” he said. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said police were on the scene “within five minutes” of the attack and that some nine minutes later the assailant was dead, he added. “The speed of the response obviously avoided a heavier toll,” he said. A police source told AFP one officer tried to restrain the attacker with a taser but when that failed a colleague shot the man dead. The attack took place on Rue Monsigny in the second arrondissement, an area that lies between the main opera house and the Louvre museum, two major tourist attractions. A large area was cordoned off where police, fire and rescue vehicles converged. Shocked tourists and residents looked on from behind the security perimeter. “I was on the cafe terrace, I heard three, four shots, it happened very fast,” said 47-year-old Gloria. “The bartenders told us to come inside very quickly. Then I went out to see what was going on, and then I saw a man on the ground,” she added. One witness, who gave her first name Maxine, said panic spread as word got out that an attack was taking place. “We saw someone coming out of a building who said he saw the assailant slaughter someone, so people took refuge in the bar,” she said. France has suffered a series of major Islamist attacks including the massacre at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, the November 2015 attacks that killed 130 in Paris, and the 2016 Bastille Day truck attack in Nice that killed more than 80. There have also been a string of less deadly but frequent attacks by lone wolf jihadists wielding knives or guns. Most of the attacks have either been claimed by the Islamic State group or been carried out in their name. A state of emergency put in place just after the 2015 Paris attacks was lifted in October when Macron’s centrist government passed a new law boosting the powers of security forces. Thousands of French troops remain on the streets under an anti-terror operation known as Sentinelle, patrolling transport hubs, tourist hotspots and other sensitive sites."
Indonesian police arrest 2 women planning to stab officers using scissors,"JAKARTA - Police have arrested two young women who planned to attack police officers by stabbing them using sharp steel scissors, two days after a militant believed to be a lonewolf stabbed an officer to death. Dita Siska Millenia, 18, and Siska Nur Azizah, 22, were arrested on Saturday (May 12) after police received a tip-off that they were descending on the country's Police Mobile Brigade (Brimob) headquarters, which has a detention facility that saw a dramatic two-day siege earlier this week. ""They are being interrogated,"" Brigadier General Muhammad Iqbal, a police spokesman, told news portal Jawapos.com late on Saturday evening. Police did not provide further details on the arrests. The Straits Times understands that the occupation listed on the suspects' IDs is 'unemployed' and their marital status is single. Police learnt that at least 50 militants were heading to Brimob headquarters from Pekanbaru (Riau province), Tegal (Central Java province), and several places of West Java province, including Karawang, Cirebon, Indramayu, and Tasikmalaya, a source told The Straits Times. On Thursday night, a 22-year-old man identified as Tendi Sumarno, a student, pulled a knife and killed a police intelligence officer near the detention centre before he was shot by the police. The detention facility in the Kelapa Dua area, just 25km from the city centre of Jakarta, housed a number of Islamist militants jailed on terror-related charges. All of them were transferred to the Nusakambangan prison island in Central Java province on Thursday. Five police officers and an inmate were killed in a two-night stand-off involving more than 150 inmates at the centre. The rioting inmates, supporters of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), held police officers hostage during the 36-hour siege, killing and torturing the five police officers. Another four officers were injured. The standoff started on Tuesday night and ended only on Thursday morning after the police mounted a raid. Police spokesman Setyo Wasisto on Friday told reporters that police arrested four militants in Bekasi, West Java, at 1.35am on Thursday morning, after a tip-off that they were heading to Brimob headquarters to join forces with the rioting inmates in Kelapa Dua. As the four militants, in handcuffs, were being taken to Jakarta, two of them made an attempt to escape. One of them strangled an officer and tried to snatch his pistol but failed, Inspector-General Setyo said. The two inmates were shot by the officers and one of them died in hospital. The four were members of the Bandung, West Java, chapter of the Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) terrorist group, which is affiliated to ISIS."
 Terror probe launched after deadly Paris knife attack,"PARIS, May 13 — A  knifeman shouting “Allahu akbar” was shot dead by police in central Paris late yesterday after he killed one person and injured four, prompting a terror probe. The attack took place near the city’s main opera house in an area full of bars, restaurants and theatres which were brimming on a weekend night. French President Emmanuel Macron said: “France once again pays the price of blood.” Yesterday’s assault is the latest to strike a nation rocked by a series of jihadist attacks in the last three years that have killed more than 245 people. Prosecutors cited witnesses as saying the man shouted “Allahu akbar” (God is greatest) as he went on the rampage, and added that a terror investigation had been launched.

The man, who has not yet been named, attacked five people with a knife, one of whom died, police said. Two were in serious condition and all the victims are in hospital. A police source told AFP one officer tried to restrain the attacker with a taser but when that failed a colleague shot the man dead. Interior Minister Gerard Collomb hailed in a tweet the “sang-froid and reaction of the police who neutralised the attacker”. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, who visited police in the district where the attack took place, added: “France is determined not to give in to threats that the attackers hope will grind her (the country) down.” The attack took place on Rue Monsigny in the 2nd arrondissement, an area that lies between the main opera house and the Louvre museum, two major tourist attractions. A large area was cordoned off where police, fire and rescue vehicles converged. Shocked tourists and residents looked on from behind the security perimeter. “I was on the cafe terrace, I heard three, four shots, it happened very fast,” said 47-year-old Gloria. “The bartenders told us to come inside very quickly.

Paris knife attack suspect was on extremist watchlist,"PARIS (AFP) - The knifeman who killed one man and wounded four other people Saturday (May 12) night in Paris had been on an anti-terror watchlist of suspected extremists, sources close to the inquiry told AFP on Sunday. The Frenchman, born in 1997 in the Russian republic of Chechnya, was on the so-called “S file” of people suspected of radicalised views who could pose security risks, the sources said, though he did not have a criminal record. Police shot and killed the man shortly after being alerted to the attack on the Rue Monsigny, a lively neighbourhood of theatres and restaurants near the main opera house in Paris. One of the five people he attacked later died, police said. Two were in serious condition and all the victims are in hospital. Witnesses said they heard the man yelling “Allahu akbar” (God is greatest) as people fled the scene.  His parents have been taken into custody. Investigators have not yet said when the man arrived in France. Many but not all of the people on France’s S file (the ‘S’ stands for security) have been involved in the series of deadly jihadist attacks that have killed some 245 people across the country since 2015. The watchlist contains anyone suspected of being a radical, including potentially dangerous religious extremists but also leftist and far-right activists. A separate list, the File for the Prevention of Terrorist Radicalisation (FSPRT), focuses on people judged to be terror threats.  That list currently has nearly 20,000 people, of whom about half are under active surveillance. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group has claimed responsibility for Saturday's attack, according to the SITE monitoring group. “The executor of the stabbing operation in the city of Paris is a soldier of the Islamic State and the operation was carried out in response to the calls to target the coalition states,” a “security source” told ISIS' official Amaq news agency, according to SITE. French President Emmanuel Macron said: ""France once again pays the price of blood."" Prosecutors said a terror investigation had been launched.

A large area was cordoned-off where police, fire and rescue vehicles converged. Shocked tourists and residents looked on from behind the security perimeter.

Then I went out to see what was going on, and then I saw a man on the ground,"" she added. Police said the attacker's motives were still unknown. The attack comes as France is under a constant threat from terrorism. A string of militant attacks have claimed the lives of over 245 people around France in the past three years."
Teenager on trial for UK terror plot with fairy tale code words," LONDON, May 11 — A trial began yesterday of a teenage girl accused of plotting a terror attack in London from behind bars using the guise of an Alice in Wonderland themed tea party. Safaa Boular was aged 17 when she allegedly schemed with her sister to launch assaults in the British capital in April, 2017. She began plotting after failing the year before to join her then-fiance Naweed Hussain, a member of the Islamic State group subsequently killed in Syria, the court heard. While in custody for allegedly trying to travel to IS territory, she encouraged her elder sister Rizlaine Boular to carry on with the plot, jurors were told. In calls from jail, she talked with her 21-year-old sibling about arranging an “Alice In Wonderland” themed tea party, which prosecutors said was code for an attack. The duo also referenced a “Mad Hatter” and “pineapples”, other code words in the plot, they added. During their investigation members of the security services posed as IS fighters online to engage with the pair and track their activities. Safaa Boular, now 18, told one officer that all she needed was a “car and a knife to get what I want to achieve”, jurors were told. Prosecutors said the sisters and their mother Mina Dich, 43, had carried out reconnaissance around major landmarks in Westminster and purchased a pack of knives and a rucksack. The trio were arrested on April 27 last year in raids by counter-terrorism police, during which Rizlaine Boular was shot. She has since pleaded guilty to terrorism offences. Safaa Boular, who lived at home with her mother in southwest London, has denied two counts of preparing acts of terrorism. Her defence lawyer Joel Bennathan told jurors that she had been “groomed” by Hussain, who was twice her age, and that her family had “encouraged” and “celebrated” it. "
German police foil Berlin half-marathon attacks,"BERLIN, April 8 — German police have detained four men, one of whom they suspect of planning knife attacks at today’s Berlin half-marathon, the newspaper Die Welt reported in its online edition. Die Welt said the four suspects were linked to Anis Amri, a Tunisian man with Islamist militant ties who killed 12 people in an attack in Berlin in December 2016 when he hijacked a truck and drove it into a crowded marketplace. Berlin police were not immediately available for comment. In its unsourced report Die Welt said the main suspect was known to Amri and had planned to stab to death spectators and runners at the half marathon. The suspect had in his possession two knives which had been especially sharpened for this purpose, the report said. Amri’s attack in Berlin in 2016 had prompted German lawmakers to call for tougher security measures. No major Islamist militant attack has been carried out in Germany since. Earlier today, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said the government would do everything possible to protect citizens, but added: “We have again experienced that ... absolute security is unfortunately not possible.” Seehofer was speaking in Muenster, where a man drove a camper van into a group of people sitting outside a restaurant on Saturday, killing two of them before shooting himself dead. Authorities have said the attacker was a 48-year-old German citizen with mental health problems and that there was no indication of an Islamist militant connection."
Sword-wielding attacker in Yogyakarta church shot by police,"JAKARTA  -  A sword-wielding man who went on a rampage in a church in Yogyakarta was shot and wounded by local police on Sunday (Feb 11). Three members of the St Lidwina Bedog church in Sleman District, as well as a police officer responding to the incident, were injured as a result of the attack. Witnesses said the attacker charged in through the main entrance of the church, hurting a member of the parish before heading towards the altar in the middle of Sunday Mass. He also destroyed statues of Jesus and the Virgin Mary during the attack, which lasted about 15 minutes before police arrived at the scene. A member of the congregation Andhi Cahyo was quoted as saying that soon after the service started, a fellow member whose head was bleeding ran into the church chased by the man. “Everybody started panicking and screaming. I was scrambling to save my wife and children,” Mr Cahyo was quoted as saying by Agence France-Presse. He said that when the police arrived, they fired a warning shot but the attacker refused to surrender. The attacker charged at one of the officers with his sword and was shot. But he somehow managed to injure the officer before being subdued, Mr Cahyo added. All four people hurt in the attack, including parish head, Father Karl-Edmund Prier, were taken to hospital where they were treated for their injuries. District police chief Muhammad Firman Lukmanul Hakim said the suspect, who suffered gunshot wounds to his legs, is being held at Bhayangkara Hospital, where he is also being treated. The police, who identified him as university student Suliono from Bayuwangi in East Java, are trying to establish where he lived in Yogyakarta. The city, located about 500km south-east of Jakarta, is regarded as the cultural heart of Java, Indonesia’s main island. The incident sparked fears of a terrorist attack on the church, but police said investigations were ongoing. Similar incidents have occurred in Indonesia in recent years. In August 2016, a knife-wielding assailant attacked a priest, also during Sunday service, at the St Joseph Catholic church in Medan, North Sumatra. Three months later, a church in Samarinda, East Kalimantan was struck by a home-made bomb which injured four people."
Knife-wielding attacker wounds four church-goers in Indonesia,"JAKARTA, Feb 11 — A knife-wielding attacker wounded four church-goers in the Indonesian city of Yogyakarta today, officials said, before being shot by police who could not yet confirm if it was a terror-related incident. Police said they were investigating possible motives for the attack by the suspect, believed to be a university student, at a Catholic church service in Yogyakarta, the gateway to the cultural centre of Indonesia’s main island of Java. “We cannot confirm yet if this was a terror-related incident,” said Yogyakarta police spokesman Yuliyanto, who goes by one name like many Indonesians. “We can confirm the suspect has been detained and is being treated at hospital.” Yuliyanto said the unidentified attacker had been shot in the stomach by police. The condition of the wounded church-goers was not immediately clear. Indonesia is an officially secular country and has the world’s largest population of Muslims, as well as sizeable minorities of Christians, Hindus, and those who adhere to traditional faiths. Communal and religious tensions have been on the rise in recent years as calls by hardline groups for sharia, or Islamic law, to be implemented nationally grow louder. Indonesia has also seen a resurgence in homegrown radicalism, inspired in part by the militant Islamic State group."
Malaysia arrests two ISIS militants over planned attacks on police stations and Buddhist monks," KUALA LUMPUR (REUTERS, THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Malaysia has arrested two men believed to have links with militant group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), including one who allegedly walked around its capital armed with a knife aiming to kill Buddhist monks, police said on Monday (Jan 22). The Muslim-majority South-east Asian nation has been on high alert since gunmen linked to ISIS launched several attacks in Jakarta, the capital of neighbouring Indonesia, in Jan 2016. The two suspects were arrested in two separate raids in December and January, on suspicion of planning to carry out acts of violence and promoting ISIS ideology. One of them, a 23-year-old Indonesian who was arrested last week on Jan 17, had allegedly scoured a busy district of the capital, Kuala Lumpur, in November, seeking Buddhist monks to kill, in retaliation for violence suffered by Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. ""The attempt failed, and police managed to confiscate a knife during the raid,"" Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi Harun, the inspector-general of police, said in a statement. The suspect had planned to attack the federal police headquarters in Bukit Aman as well as the Travers police station. He added that the suspect had also allegedly communicated with a senior ISIS leader over WhatsApp, had sought to recruit several other Indonesians and put up an ISIS flag at the building site where he worked. The other suspect, a 25-year-old Malaysian teacher at a private religious school, was detained in Dec on suspicion of planning an attack on entertainment outlets and to rob, kidnap or kill non-Muslims. The suspect, who had been previously jailed under Malaysia's anti-terror law, had also maintained contact with former members of known terror groups and promoted ISIS ideology on his Facebook account to recruit new members, police said. Separately,  the Kuala Lumpur High Court on Monday sentenced a former factory supervisor to eight years in jail for attempting to go to Syria with intent to commit terrorist acts. Mohamad Awang, 42, was arrested in Kuala Lumpur on Feb 21 last year with a flight ticket, an international passport, a handphone and several SIM cards in his possession. He had planned to go to Syria via Teheran. Malaysia has arrested hundreds of people over the past few years for suspected links to militant groups. A grenade attack on a bar on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur in June 2016 wounded eight people. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, the first such incident on Malaysian soil. Mr Fuzi also said in a statement on Monday that police will be ramping up security during the Hindu celebration of Thaipusam on Jan 31. ""Police will be increasing security measures in all locations across the country to prevent untoward incidents that could disrupt the event,"" he said."
Truck attack against Swedish 'infidels' planned for months: Prosecutors,"STOCKHOLM (AFP) - A 39-year-old Uzbek asylum seeker who confessed to an April 2017 Stockholm truck attack that killed five people planned his assault ""against infidels"" in Sweden for months, prosecutors said on Tuesday (Jan 30). Rakhmat Akilov, who swore allegiance to Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) prior to the attack, has admitted to stealing a truck and mowing down a crowd of people on a pedestrian street on a Friday afternoon. Prosecutors formally charged him on Tuesday with ""terrorism and attempted terrorism"". Akilov wanted to ""instigate fear among the public in Sweden and force Sweden's government and parliament to end Sweden's participation in military training of the global coalition against ISIS in Iraq,"" the indictment said. ISIS has, however, never claimed responsibility for the attack. Arrested a few hours after the assault thanks to video surveillance images, Akilov confessed to police the next day. The prosecution said it would present as evidence excerpts of Akilov's chat conversations concerning his ""willingness to carry out a terror attack"" and his ""desire to join ISIS"". In one chat, Akilov asked for help ""to carry out a crime, he wanted to run down infidels (because) Sweden supports Nato and sends bomb technicians to Iraq and train Kurds,"" the indictment read. Prosecutors, who will argue Akilov acted alone, will also present two videos recorded on the eve of the attack in which Akilov swore allegiance to ISIS. It was still not known why Akilov became radicalised, but ""he wasn't radicalised right before the attack,"" prosecutor Hans Ihrman said. The prosecution plans to present as evidence Akilov's chat texts dating back to January 2017, photos of the area taken with his smartphone ahead of the attack and Internet searches for possible targets and bomb materials on his computer. After crashing the truck into the facade of a department store, Akilov set off an explosive device in the cab of the truck made up of five butane gas canisters, screws, knife blades and metal objects, causing damage to the truck but no injuries, prosecutors said. He then fled the scene. ""His motive was to punish Sweden for its participation in the war against ISIS,"" prosecutor Hans Ihrman told reporters. Akilov's lawyer Johan Eriksson told reporters his client would explain his motives further during the trial. ""He admits committing a terrorist act"" and ""admits that he should be convicted"" and expelled from Sweden after serving his sentence, Eriksson said, adding that Akilov had not expected to survive the attack. ""He thought he would be shot or would die."" The Stockholm district court announced on Tuesday that the trial would start on Feb 13. A construction worker, Akilov had gone underground after his application for Swedish residency was rejected in 2016, police said last year. Three Swedes, including an 11-year-old girl, a 41-year old British man, and a 31-year-old Belgian woman were killed in the attack. Around 10 others were injured. Similar assaults with vehicles have taken place in Europe in recent years, including Berlin, London and the southern French city of Nice, where 86 people were killed and more than 400 were injured on July 14, 2016. That attack was claimed by ISIS."
 Six Africans injured in ‘racial’ drive-by shooting spree in Italy," MACERATA, Feb 4 — A shaven-headed far-right supporter suspected of wounding six Africans yesterday in brazen drive-by shootings in central Italy was arrested, as the country’s interior minister said “racial hatred” had prompted the attack. After the morning assault in the town of Macerata, the suspect got out of his car, allegedly made a fascist salute with a tricolour Italian flag draped over his shoulders and shouted “Viva Italia”, or “Long Live Italy”, and “Italy for Italians,” media reports said. The wounded included five men and one woman from Ghana, Mali and Nigeria, the Agi news agency said. It came a day after a Nigerian man was arrested in the town over the gruesome murder of a teenage Italian girl. Interior Minister Marco Minniti said the attack was part of a culture “of right-wing extremism with clear reference to fascism and Nazism” and deplored that the sole link between the victims was “the colour of their skin”. He said the “criminal act” was “prepared in advance”. The man allegedly opened fire in eight areas in the town and also targeted the office of the centre-left Democratic Party in a two-hour terror spree in the sleepy town of 43,000 people, press reports said. “Six people were injured and all of them are foreigners,” said town mayor Romano Carancini. Police confirmed in a tweet that “the wounded persons were of foreign nationality”, adding that the “presumed author of the attack is Italian”. One victim was seriously injured in the thorax, press reports said. The other five had lesser injuries. A Nigerian man who was shot in the thigh while buying cigarettes on the street, telling a television channel from his hospital bed that he was in great pain, adding: “It’s very serious.” Television footage showed the suspect being arrested at the town’s war memorial. Police also posted a photo of the capture. Authorities identified the suspected shooter as Luca Traini, 28. He is a member of the far-right anti-immigration Northern League party and had run in local elections last year. Media reports said police found a gun in the man’s vehicle, a black Alfa Romeo. “Someone who shoots is a delinquent, irrespective of the colour of his skin,” said Northern league chief Matteo Salvini, in full campaign mode ahead of legislative elections on March 4. “I’m in a hurry to be in government to bring back security, social justice and serenity to Italy,” he said. Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni meanwhile made a pitch for unity, saying: “Hate and violence will not divide us.” The attack comes a day after a Nigerian asylum-seeker and drug dealer was arrested in Macerata over the gruesome killing of an 18-year-old Italian woman whose dismembered body was discovered in suitcases earlier this week. Police found the clothes of the victim, Pamela Mastropietro, in the house of the 29-year-old Nigerian as well as a bloodstained knife. However, no official link has been made between the two incidents. Italians head to the polls in national elections next month, with immigration shaping up to be a key issue. The country is a favoured landing point on Europe’s southern coastline for migrants making the perilous journey across the Mediterranean, often aboard unseaworthy boats, to enter the continent. But 2017 was a turning point for Italy: the country went from large-scale arrivals in the first six months to a sharp drop-off, thanks to controversial agreement between the EU and Libya. Some 119,000 people landed in Italy last year, down 35 percent on 2016. The Northern League is part of a populist coalition tipped to do well in the elections. According to opinion polls, the alliance between ex-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi’s centre-right Forza Italia (Go Italy), the post-fascist Fratelli d’Italia (Italian Brothers) and the Northern League leads with more than 35 percent ahead of the March 4 vote."
Three men charged with supplying gun to Strasbourg market attacker,"Three men were Friday charged with supplying the weapon used by the gunman in the Christmas market attack in the French city of Strasbourg and placed in pre-trial detention, a judicial source said. The three suspects, from the same family and aged 32, 34 and 78, were indicted by an examining magistrate in Paris for “possession and transfer of a category B weapon in relation to a criminal terrorist enterprise” and for “conspiracy with terrorist criminals”, according to the source. They are alleged to have supplied an 8mm pistol used by Cherif Chekatt, a small-time criminal who shot dead five people and wounded 11 during the December 11 attack on the open-air Christmas market. The three men were arrested Tuesday in eastern France along with two other members of the family, who were released from custody Wednesday evening without being charged. The three suspects were transferred Thursday from Strasbourg to the counter-terrorism bureau in Levallois-Perret, near Paris. On December 17, another man, a relative of the killer, was also arrested and charged on the same counts. Anti-terrorist police believe Chekatt had obtained the firearm — an 8mm pistol — a few days before the attack. Chekatt, 29, who was on a special watchlist as a suspected radical Islamist, was shot dead by police after a two-day manhunt in the city on the German border. Judicial sources said Chekatt had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group in a video found on a USB key. The interior minister has dismissed a claim by the Islamic State group that it was responsible for the attack. France has been on high alert since the start of a wave of jihadist attacks in 2015 which have killed 251 people."

One killed in Paris knife attack by man shouting 'Allahu akbar',"PARIS: An assailant shouting ""Allahu akbar"" killed a passer-by in a knife attack that also wounded four others in the heart of Paris late on Saturday before he was shot dead by police, French authorities said. The country has been on high alert amid a series of attacks, commissioned or inspired by the Islamic State militant group, that has killed more than 240 people since 2015. France ""will not yield an inch to the enemies of freedom,"" President Emmanuel Macron said after the attack, praising officers for ""neutralizing the terrorist."" The first call to police was placed at 8:47 p.m. local time (1847 GMT), officers were on the scene within five minutes, and the attacker was ""neutralized"" within nine minutes of that first call, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told reporters. Police union representative Rocco Contento told Reuters that the assailant, after attacking bystanders with a knife, rushed at police shouting ""I will kill you, I will kill you!"" He was then shot by the officers. The attack took place in the heart of the French capital in a district popular with tourists for its many restaurants and cafes, landmark retail stores, and the Paris opera. Prosecutor Francois Molins told reporters the police's anti-terrorism unit would launch an investigation, given the aggressor's ""mode of operation."" The identity of the attacker man was not yet known, officials said early on Sunday. A picture seen by Reuters, which a source said showed the attacker, showed a bare-chested and bearded young man dressed in black trousers. The Islamic State claimed responsibility via its Amaq news agency, but provided no proof for its claim. Witnesses described for French media how they saw the assailant running towards police officers who shot him. ""We were told to get into a bar quickly. I was curious and went outside again. Outside, I saw a person on the ground about 200 metres from me. The police, fire brigade and ambulance arrived,"" one female witness told LCI television. ""I could not see anything else after that."" Authorities did not immediately reveal the identity of the victim."
French police quiz radicalised girlfriend of supermarket gunman,"PARIS, March 27 — French investigators yesterday quizzed the radicalised girlfriend of the Islamist gunman who shot dead four people last week in southern France, including a heroic policeman killed after taking the place of a hostage. Policeman Arnaud Beltrame was the fourth person killed during Radouane Lakdim’s rampage in the towns of Carcassonne and Trebes that also left three people injured. Beltrame’s mother Nicole said she was not surprised that her 44-year-old son offered to be swapped for a woman held hostage by Lakdim at a supermarket in the sleepy town of Trebes. “I know Arnaud: loyal, altruistic, and since he was small, working for other people, committed to the country,” she said, adding the practising Catholic would have wanted his act to make people “a bit more tolerant”. Lakdim, a 25-year-old Moroccan-born French national who was on a watchlist of suspected extremists, also killed a butcher and an elderly shopper when he stormed the Super U supermarket after firing at police and shooting dead a man when hijacking a car in Carcassonne. During the siege he said he was acting on behalf of the Islamic State group and demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam, the prime suspect in the November 2015 Paris terror attacks. Yesterday, police continued to question his 18-year-old girlfriend, who converted to Islam at 16 and had also been on the watchlist of potential radicals. Paris prosecutor Francois Molins told reporters that she shouted Allahu Akbar (God is greatest) while in custody, but denied any prior knowledge of Lakdim’s attack plans. A 17-year-old man described as a friend of Lakdim’s who was under his sway, is also in custody over the attack. He too denies any involvement, Molins said. Under France’s anti-terrorism laws, the two suspects can be held for up to 96 hours without charge. Over 200 officers are probing the latest in a string of jihadist attacks that have claimed the lives of over 240 people around France since January 2015. President Emmanuel Macron will lead a national commemoration to Beltrame at Invalides military museum in Paris on Wednesday, his office said. Pope Francis, in a message to the Catholic Church in Carcassonne, saluted “the generous and heroic gesture of Lieutenant-Colonel Arnaud Beltrame, who gave his life in trying to protect others.” Richard Lizurey, the head of France’s gendarmes police service, said Beltrame took the initiative to swap places with a woman being used by Lakdim as a human shield at the Super U supermarket in Trebes. Beltrame’s widow Marielle told the Christian weekly La Vie that his actions were “the act of a gendarme and of a Christian.” Lakdim came to France with his family in 1992 as an infant and gained citizenship 12 years later. He dabbled in drugs and petty crime and in 2016 spent a month in prison but prison authorities “detected no visible sign of radicalisation”, Molins said. But investigators have found notes at his home in Carcassonne referring to the Islamic State group, a legal source said, including a handwritten letter in which he claimed allegiance to the jihadists. Armed with a gun, knife and homemade explosive devices, he remained holed up for over two hours at the Super U supermarket with Beltrame, who took the place of a female hostage. Beltrame was fatally stabbed in the throat by Lakdim shortly before police stormed the store, ending the siege. Hundreds of mourners packed a church service Sunday for the victims of France’s latest Islamist attack. Asked if she felt hatred towards Lakdim, Beltrame’s mother replied: “Not at all. I feel indifference and the greatest sense of contempt.” She also suggested not even talking about him, “not showing his photo. We should show the photos of heroes, not killers and monsters.” "
Proud mother of slain French police hero calls for tolerance,"PARIS (AFP) - The mother of a French policeman killed in an attack last week after he swapped himself for a hostage said Monday (March 26) she was proud of his actions, and did not feel hate towards his killer. Speaking to RTL radio on Monday, Nicolle Beltrame said she was not surprised by her 44-year-old son Arnaud's selfless act at a supermarket in south-west France on Friday, saying he was a fierce patriot and proud serviceman. ""Arnaud would not have wanted us to give up,"" she said. ""I'm here to honour him and I'm speaking to honour him, so that his act has some purpose, that we're a bit more human, a bit more tolerant."" She added: ""We need to realise that we can't accept everything either."" Arnaud was killed on Friday during a shooting spree and hostage-taking around the towns of Carcassonne and Trebes by Radouane Lakdim, a Moroccan-born French national, that left four people dead and three injured. Beltrame said when she heard that a policeman had been killed on Friday, she knew it was her son. ""I know Arnaud: loyal, altruistic, and since he was small working for other people, committed to the country,"" she explained. It also emerged Monday that Lakdim's girlfriend, like the gunman himself, had been on a watchlist of suspected extremists, sources close to the inquiry told AFP. The 18-year-old woman, who has been in police custody since Friday evening, was under surveillance by intelligence services, one source told AFP. A legal source had told AFP on Sunday that the woman was answering questions during her detention, and had ""shown signs of radicalisation"". A 17-year-old man has also been detained for questioning. Lakdim, 25, a drug dealer with a criminal record, was on France's extremist watchlist but authorities had concluded that he did not pose a threat. Asked if she felt hatred towards Lakdim, Nicolle Beltrame replied: ""Not at all. I feel indifference and the greatest sense of contempt."" She suggested not even talking about him, ""not showing his photo. We should show the photos of heroes, not killers and monsters."" Richard Lizurey, the head of France’s gendarmes police service, said Beltrame had taken the initiative to swap places with a woman being used by Lakdim as a human shield at the Super U supermarket in Trebes. “It was the first time in the history of the service this kind of act was done,” Lizurey told France Inter radio. “The decision made by Arnaud Beltrame was his own decision, which he determined he had to do because he wanted to save a hostage’s life, which is what he did."" President Emmanuel Macron’s office has said a national tribute will be organised in the coming days, expected for Wednesday or Thursday. “He has not spoken to me directly but I’m aware there will indeed be a national commemoration at the Invalides,” the officer’s mother said, referring to the military museum and hospital in Paris. Investigators have found notes at Lakdim's home in Carcassonne referring to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria group, a legal source said, including a handwritten letter in which he claimed allegiance to the extremists. On Friday, Lakdim, armed with a gun, knife and homemade explosive devices, hijacked a car in Carcassonne and shot the two people inside, killing the passenger and leaving the Portuguese driver in a critical condition. He also shot and wounded a police officer out jogging before heading to Trebes, where he killed the butcher and a customer at the Super U supermarket before taking hostages. Beltrame was shot and stabbed in the throat by Lakdim shortly before police stormed the store and ended the siege. He died of his wounds early Saturday, prompting an outpouring of emotion across the country."
Police monitoring thousands of IS-linked social media accounts," KUALA LUMPUR, March 13 ? Thousands of social media accounts suspected of links to the Islamic State (IS) terrorist group are being monitored by local law enforcers, said the Home Ministry. Deputy Home Minister Datuk Masir Kujat told Parliament that to date 3,871 Facebook accounts are being monitored while 800 more were blocked and 240 users arrested. On Twitter, the police are monitoring 76 accounts, have blocked nine and arrested eight people. On Instagram, the police are monitoring 72 accounts and have made one arrest. “We find that they use social media to recruit new members and to look for funds from sympathisers. We have arrested those who use social media as (IS) recruiting grounds,” he said when answering an additional question by Tasek Gelugor (BN) MP Datuk Shabudin Yahaya. He attributed the police’s success to its counter messaging centre (CMC), which has been tasked to curb IS influence and propaganda on social media. Earlier, Masir also told Dewan Rakyat that the Home Ministry is deradicalising 19 people consisting of 18 locals and one foreigner. Another nine individuals have also reached the last phase, which is phase four of the deradicalisation programme. “The deradicalisation programmes uses a systematic and holistic deradicalisation procedures on terrorist consisting of religious, nationalistic, psychological, familial and core values. “The programme is considered successful when the detainees can be released and are no longer involved in terror activities. The modules are consistently reviewed and updated from time to time,” said Masir."
Calls for knife attacks preceded Sunday's sword rampage in Yogyakarta church: Counter-terror official,"KUALA LUMPUR: Radical groups were calling for knife attacks in Indonesia just a week before a sword-wielding man stabbed a Catholic priest and three others during mass in a church in Yogyakarta on Sunday (Feb 12), a counter-terrorism source told Channel NewsAsia. The attacker also slashed the statues of Jesus and the Virgin Mary during the violence at the Santa Lidwina church in Yogyakarta, Central Java. Counter-terrorism officials and the police are now investigating whether the attacker, Suliyono, 23, was inspired by radicals to carry out the attacks as a lonewolf or whether he is part of a terror group. “From several radical groups we were monitoring, it was found that they (radicals) were broadcasting calls to mujahidins to use knives to carry out attacks just a week ago,” a counter-terrorism official told Channel NewsAsia. The official did not give details on what platforms the broadcasts were delivered. Police are also investigating whether the suspect is linked to terror groups from Solo, Central Java, which had earlier planned to carry out attacks during Christmas and New Year’s Day but later postponed them. Counter-terrorism sources are now predicting an increase in acts of terror in Yogyakarta as there have been a rising number of activities by radical groups in the province. “In the past few months, there has been several incidents of persecution and rejection of church activities by the Islamic Jihad Front (FJI), among others, in Bantul and Mount Kidul,” the official told Channel NewsAsia. Bantul and Mount Kidul are regencies in Yogyakarta province. FJI is a hardline group that was launched in 2011 and headquartered in Bantul. The group is implicated in acts of violence against minorities, including Christians and Shias. On Jan 28, FJI disrupted and shut down a charity event organised by the St Paulus Pringgolayan Catholic church in Bantul. “Acts of persecution, attacks and terror in the special province of Yogyakarta will increase in line with the rise of activities by radical mass organisations, and also because of the policy of the provincial government, which has not taken firm actions in dealing with these acts of violence and intolerance in the city,” the official said. On Monday (Feb 12), Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo told reporters that there is no place for intolerance in Indonesia. “There is no place for those who are intolerant in our country, Indonesia,” President Widodo was quoted as saying by the Kompas daily, adding that the country’s constitution guarantees religious freedom to every citizen."
Gunman with IS links kills 3 in Belgian city,"A gunman on a police watchlist for contacts with Islamist extremists launched a brazen suspected terror attack in Belgium on Tuesday, shooting dead two female police officers with their own weapons before killing a bystander. The bloodshed in the gritty eastern industrial city of Liege began around 10:30 a.m. (0830 GMT) when the attacker armed with a knife repeatedly stabbed the two officers before using their own firearms to kill them, prosecutors said. Federal prosecutors said they had launched a terror investigation into the incident. Amateur video obtained by AFP appears to show the gunman shouting “Allahu Akbar” (“God is greatest”) as he attacked the police, although officials did not confirm it. Belgium remains on high alert after a string of attacks, including twin suicide bombings in Brussels in 2016 claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group. “Armed with a knife, the suspect followed and attacked two police officers, and used their own firearms to kill them,” prosecutor Philippe Dulieu told a news conference. “He continued on foot, attacking a parked vehicle where he opened fire on a 22-year-old man in the passenger seat. The young man died.” “He then continued and entered the Leonie de Waha school. He took a woman working there as hostage. Police intervened, he came out firing on the police officers, wounding several before he was killed,” he added. A source close to the investigation told AFP that the gunman was on a special police watchlist because of his contacts with radical Islamists. The source named the attacker as Benjamin Herman, born in 1982, saying he had past convictions for robbery, violence, and drug dealing. Herman was “already on the run” after committing another murder on Monday night in the town of On, in southern Belgium, the source said, though local prosecutors said they have not yet established a link with the Liege incident. He was reported by Belgian broadcaster RTBF to have been released from prison on Monday. “He is suspected of having been radicalized (in prison)… He has been reported or presumed to be belonging to the entourage of an Islamist recruiter,” the source said on condition of anonymity. A Twitter user posted dramatic footage of the violent climax to the incident. As a group of armed officers approach the entrance to the school, the black-clad gunman bursts out with a gun in each hand, before collapsing under a deafening hail of police bullets. Liege police chief Christian Beaupere said it was “clear that the assassin’s objective was to attack the police.” He added that one of the four officers wounded in the attack had suffered a serious leg injury. Liege, a major city in Western Europe’s former industrial heartland, was the scene of another bloody shootout in 2011. In that attack a former convict armed with grenades and an automatic rifle killed six people and wounded more than 120. Prime Minister Charles Michel denounced what he called the “cowardly and blind violence” of Tuesday’s attack. “All our support for the victims and their loved ones. We are following the situation with the security services and the crisis center,” Michel tweeted. There was support from other European countries, with French President Emmanuel Macron condemning the incident as a “terrible attack” and expressing the “solidarity of the French people”. British Prime Minister Theresa May said the United Kingdom “stands resolute with our Belgian allies against terror”. A major security cordon was set up around the area, while panicked parents came to collect their children from the school complex. The governor of Liege province said all the children and staff were safe and unhurt. “All the children are fine, those of the primary and kindergarten saw nothing, they were evacuated through the back of the school,” Julie Fernandez, mother of a seven-year-old at the school, told AFP. “They were cared for by staff and psychologists and high school students were cared for in a nearby park,” added Fernandez, who is also an MP. Belgium has been on high alert since authorities in January 2015 smashed a terror cell in the town of Verviers that was planning an attack on police. The cell also had links to Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the mastermind of the November 2015 IS attacks on Paris that killed 130 people. Belgium further raised its terror alert level after the Paris attack and placed the capital Brussels on lockdown for a week. The country was then hit itself by IS suicide attacks on Brussels airport and a metro station, which killed 32 people in March 2016. In August that same year, a machete-wielding man shouting “Allahu Akbar” attacked two policewomen in the industrial town of Charleroi before being shot dead. The country’s law enforcement agencies and intelligence services came under intense scrutiny for apparently missing a series of leads after the Paris attacks that could have led to the Brussels bombers."
"Iran promises ‘crushing’ response if US designates Guards a terrorist group, reports media","LONDON, Oct 9 — Iran promised today to give a “crushing” response if the United States designated its elite Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group. The pledge came a week before President Donald Trump announces final decision on how he wants to contain Tehran. He is expected on Oct 15 to will decertify the landmark international deal to curb Iran’s nuclear programme, in a step that potentially could cause the 2015 accord to unravel. Trump is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation, as he rolls out a broader US strategy on Iran. “We are hopeful that the United States does not make this strategic mistake,” foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA at a news conference. “If they do, Iran’s reaction would be firm, decisive and crushing and the United States should bear all its consequences,” he added. Individuals and entities associated with the IRGC are currently on the US list of foreign terrorist organisations, but the organisation as a whole is not. IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said yesterday “if the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.” Jafari also said that additional sanctions would end the chances for future dialogue with the United States and that the Americans would have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000 km (1,250 mile) range of IRGC’s missiles."
France foiled possible ricin attack,"PARIS • French police have foiled a suspected attack by an Egyptian man, possibly involving the lethal poison ricin, officials and sources close to the inquiry said yesterday. The plot was one of three prevented by domestic intelligence agents since the start of this year, Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said. He said the attack would have been committed ""with explosives or ricin"", which he described as a very ""powerful poison"". The suspect ""had tutorials that showed how to make ricin-based poisons"", Mr Collomb told BFM television. The man, who was born in Egypt in 1988 and living legally in France, was not previously known to security services, he said. The suspect was arrested alongside another Egyptian, initially identified by Mr Collomb as a brother, who has been released after investigators determined he was not involved in the planned attack. Mr Collomb said the plot was thwarted after intelligence agents intercepted messages on the secure social media platform Telegram. ""We're following a number of people on (social media) networks. These two happened to be on Telegram,"" he told BFM TV. The pair were detained on May 11 after a search of an apartment uncovered a bag of gunpowder obtained from fireworks and guides for making explosives and poisons, a source close to the inquiry said. Under questioning, the suspect ""freely admitted looking up jihadist propaganda and claimed that a person, not yet identified, had asked him via Telegram to find fireworks to make a bomb and strike in France"", the source said. Police later found that despite later denials, in subsequent messages the suspect ""had in reality accepted the mission and was ready to die as a martyr by blowing himself up"", the source said. Investigators believe the evidence suggests he was ""very determined"" to strike, the source added. The two Egyptians were arrested just a day before a 29-year-old man was killed and five other people injured in a knife attack by Khamzat Azimov, a 20-year-old man of Chechen origin, in Paris last Saturday night. They lived in the same northern 18th Arrondissement of Paris as Azimov. Parts of the district are packed with low-income high-rises and a mix of French and immigrant communities. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria later claimed responsibility for the knife attack, releasing a video purporting to show Azimov pledging allegiance to the militant group. A friend of Azimov's, named as Abdul Hakim A., was charged with terrorist conspiracy on Thursday and two women have been detained for questioning. A source said one of the women was a radicalised 19-year-old who married Abdul Hakim A. before trying to leave for Syria in January last year. France has been on high alert since the massacre of journalists at the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, the first in a wave of terror strikes on French soil which have left 246 people dead. In late March, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe indicated that a total of 51 attacks had been thwarted by French security services since January 2015."
 10 killed as van plows into Toronto crowd,"TORONTO, Canada — Canadian police sought a motive Tuesday for a van attack on a bustling downtown Toronto street that left at least 10 pedestrians dead. The driver of the van, who was arrested, was to appear in court Tuesday at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT | 10 p.m. PHT), Canadian media said. Police said the incident during the busy lunch hour Monday appeared to be deliberate, but that they had not identified a terror link. It took place in broad daylight around 16 kilometers (10 miles) from a conference center hosting a meeting of G7 ministers, but officials said they had no evidence of a link to the event. Ralph Goodale, the minister of public security, added that “on the basis of all available information at the present time, there would appear to be no national security connection to this particular incident.” “Horrible day in Toronto,” he posted earlier on Twitter. “Senseless violence takes heavy toll.” Police arrested a suspect at the scene, who police identified later as 25-year-old Alek Minassian from a northern Toronto suburb. The suspect and a police officer faced off, their guns drawn. The suspect eventually surrendered his weapon and was taken into custody. Fifteen people remained in hospitals throughout the city, Saunders said, adding that local, provincial and federal investigators were probing the case. Two South Koreans were among the dead, a Seoul foreign ministry official told AFP, with another of its citizens seriously injured. At the scene, at least three bodies could be seen under orange sheets and a long stretch of road was sealed off with police incident tape. Vehicle attacks have been carried out to deadly effect by extremists in a number of capitals and major cities, including London, Paris, New York and Nice. Canada’s Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said the G7 meeting would continue as planned into Tuesday, with officials discussing ways to secure democratic societies from foreign interference. “The work of the ministers obviously goes on. This is a very sad day for the people of Toronto and the people of Canada,” she said. – ’Really fast’ – Officers were called to the scene — on Yonge Street at the corner with Finch Avenue — around 1:30 pm (1730 GMT), police said. A white rental van with a dented front bumper was stopped on the sidewalk of a major intersection, surrounded by police vehicles. “He was going really fast,” witness Alex Shaker told CTV television. “All I could see was just people one by one getting knocked out, knocked out, one by one,” Shaker said. “There are so many people lying down on the streets.” Another witness, Jamie Eopni, told local Toronto television station CP24: “It was crashing into everything. It destroyed a bench. If anybody was on that street, they would have been hit on the sidewalk.” Though the act seemed “deliberate,” officials did not identify a terror link. Canada has only rarely been the scene of terror attacks. In October, a man stabbed a police officer in the western city of Edmonton before slamming his van into a group of pedestrians, hurting four people. And in Quebec in October 2014, a Canadian man ran over two soldiers in a parking lot with his car, killing one of them. The driver was shot dead by police when he attacked them with a knife. In March 2016, a Canadian who claimed to have radical Islamist sympathies attacked two soldiers at a military recruitment center in Toronto."
"Van plows into Toronto crowd, killing nine","The incident took place in broad daylight around 10 miles (16 kilometers) from a conference center hosting a meeting of G7 ministers, but officials said they had no evidence of a link to the event. Police arrested a suspect at the scene, but said it was too soon to say whether the attack in Toronto -- which has a population of about 2.8 million people -- had been deliberate, and if so, what the driver's motivation might have been. ""This is going to be a complex investigation,"" deputy police chief Peter Yuen told reporters. ""We have one person in custody and the investigation is ongoing."" ""We can confirm for you tonight right now we have nine people that are dead, 16 injured."" At the scene, an AFP reporter saw at least three bodies under orange sheets and a long stretch of road sealed off with police incident tape. Dan Cass of Sunnybrook hospital said 10 injured people had been brought in. Two of them were pronounced dead on arrival and five were in critical condition. Television images showed the man and a police officer facing off, their guns drawn. The suspect eventually surrendered his weapon and was taken into custody. Vehicle attacks have been carried out to deadly effect by extremists in a number of capitals and major cities, including London, Paris, New York and Nice, heightening fears of a deliberate ramming. Canada's minister for public safety, Ralph Goodale was asked at the G7 meeting whether the government had received any threats or information to suggest that the talks might be targeted. ""No, not to my knowledge,"" he said. Standing alongside him, Canada's foreign minister Chrystia Freeland said the G7 meeting would continue as planned into Tuesday, with officials discussing ways to secure democratic societies from foreign interference.

"Two caught for plotting IS attacks, al Maunah-style raid on Bukit Aman"," PETALING JAYA, Jan 22 — Police arrested two people on suspicion of planning terrorist attacks against non-Muslims and an audacious raid on the federal police’s armoury here as part of the Islamic State (IS)’s activities. According to Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi Harun, the first suspect was a 23-year-old Indonesian labourer who allegedly planned a daring raid on the Bukit Aman federal police headquarters to seize the police’s weaponry and on the Travers police station in Brickfields. In shades of the al Maunah incident of 2000, Mohamad Fuzi said the suspect had also attempted to infiltrate army camps and other police stations to acquire guns and ammunition for militant groups in the region to launch attacks. He said the suspect was arrested on Thursday after police discovered he was conducting reconnaissance activities around Jalan Pudu, Kuala Lumpur, while armed with a knife. “The suspect was targeting Buddhist monks and planned to kill them as an act of revenge against Muslim Rohingya persecuted in Myanmar by the government,” he said. The suspect was also found to have been in contact with a senior leader of the IS through WhatsApp and tried to recruit Indonesians to their cause. “To prove that Daesh was still active in Malaysia, he also raised the group’s flag at his construction site workplace,” he said, using the alternate name for the terrorist group. Police arresting a religious teacher suspected of involvement with IS, in Petaling Jaya. — Picture courtesy of Royal Malaysian Police The second suspect is a 25-year-old teacher at a private religious school in Subang Jaya who was arrested in Petaling Jaya on Dec 23. “He was previously detained under the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 in November 2015, but was subsequently released after serving his 18 months sentence in 2016,” he said in a statement. Mohamad Fuzi said the suspect resumed involvement with the IS after he was freed, and allegedly planned several attacks against entertainment outlets throughout Klang Valley. The man allegedly planned to rob, kidnap and murder non-Muslims based on his belief that they were infidels. Investigations found that the suspect actively used his personal Facebook account to recruit new members and was linked to several IS terror cells that were previously neutralised using the Internal Security Act before it was abolished."
Malaysia pulling out all the stops in war on terrorism,"PUTRAJAYA: Malaysian authorities have thwarted 19 terror plots and apprehended 369 suspect Islamic State (IS) militants the last four years. Deputy Home Minister Datuk Nur Jazlan Mohamed said 87 foreigners were among the terrorists detected between 2013 and 2017. ""The grenade attack at the Movida bar in Puchong in June 2016 was considered as the first IS-linked attack in Malaysia,” he said of the attack which injured eight people then. ""Thankfully, it did not result in any deaths, and the perpetrators were arrested and sentenced to jail,” Nur Jazlan added. Two people admitted to the crime and were each jailed 25 years. ""That incident was an apt reminder to us on the reality of modern terrorism, where conflicts that is happening thousands of miles away can have a very real repercussions on our security back home,"" he said when delivering the national statement during the Putrajaya International Security Dialogue at Marriot Hotel here. Nur Jazlan said it was time to review the current approach in addressing terrorism as IS recruits new members through social media. ""Through social media, IS continues to recruit members across the globe, mostly targeting disfranchised young men and women who seeks affirmation in their lives. ""They offer a form of escapism by tainting these young minds with their twisted world view and perverse ideology coupled the promise of a higher purpose in life. ""Therefore, the time has come for us to review our current approach in the war on terror. The heavy handed approach which may seem effective in the short term, does not address the core issues of terrorism, which is just as much as this is a war against criminals and terrorists, it is also a war for the hearts and minds, a battle of competing ideologies,"" he said. Nur Jazlan said Malaysia has mooted on the idea of offering a moderate religious interpretation as a proactive measure to stamp out extremism. ""Through counselling, re-education and by involving religious leaders and experts in correcting and countering the perverted views of Islam to terror convicts, we found that not only is it an effective tool in de-racialising them, it would also turn former convicts into key propagator in countering IS propaganda and ideology,"" said Nur Jazlan. Sudanese Interior Minister Major General (Police) Dr Hamid Mohamed, in his national statement, said Sudan also used the same approach as Malaysia to rehabilitate those involved in terrorism cells, which is through deradicalisation programmes. ""The young ones are the easy target for the extremists to recruit them as new members. ""We have deradicalisation programmes as counterterrorism measures. This is to rehabilitate those with extreme and violent religious or political ideologies to adopt more moderate views,"" he said. Representative of the Turkish president Mehmet Mehdi Eker said Turkey actively participates in the Anti-IS coalition such as Foreign Terrorist Fighters and Counter-Finance Working Groups. He also praised Malaysia as a good example for a multiracial, multi-cultural and multi-religious country with people living together in peace and harmony."
"Man drives into crowd in Germany, at least 2 dead","MÜNSTER, Germany — A man smashed a van into a packed restaurant terrace in Germany Saturday killing at least two people before shooting himself dead, with authorities ruling out an “Islamist” motive. Images of the scene showed broken and upturned tables and chairs strewn across the pavement in the center of the picturesque medieval city of Muenster. While stressing that the investigation was still ongoing, state interior minister Herbert Reul said the perpetrator was believed to be a German citizen “and not, as has been claimed everywhere, a refugee or something like that”. “There is no indication at the moment that there is any Islamist connection,” said Reul, who is from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats. At least 20 people were injured, six of them seriously, police said. The assailant was found shot dead behind the wheel of his van. The police said that “a potentially suspicious object” had been found in the vehicle that might possibly be an explosive, and experts had been called in to deactivate it. Media reports said the driver, identified only as Jens R., had a history of mental health problems. Public broadcaster ZDF said the man had recently attempted suicide while rolling news channel NTV said he had spoken of a desire to bring as much attention as possible to his death. ZDF also reported that he had possible links with far-right movements. The magazine, Der Spiegel, reported that Jens R. lived in Muenster and police had found an assault weapon at his flat. Police in the university city of 300,000 did not immediately confirm the reports. “There was a bang and then screaming. The police arrived and got everyone out of here,” an employee of the restaurant hit by the terrace told NTV. “There were a lot of people screaming. I’m angry — it’s cowardly to do something like this.” Germany has long braced for more violence after several attacks claimed by the Islamic State jihadist group, the bloodiest of which was a truck rampage through a Berlin Christmas market in December 2016 that left 12 people dead. Armed police were deployed in Muenster after Saturday’s incident with officers urging residents to avoid the city center to allow investigators to get to work amid initial fears the country had suffered another extremist assault. Merkel said she was “deeply shaken” by the incident “everything possible will be done to determine what was behind this act and to help the victims”. The presidents of Russia and France, Vladimir Putin and Emmanuel Macron, each sent their condolences. The attack is the latest in a string across Europe in which vehicles have been used to attack crowds of people in public places. In the Berlin Christmas market attack, Tunisian asylum-seeker Anis Amri hijacked a truck and murdered its Polish driver before killing another 11 people and wounding dozens more by ploughing the heavy vehicle through the festive market in central Berlin. He was shot dead by Italian police in Milan four days later while on the run. Germany has since been targeted again in attacks with radical Islamist motives. In July 2017, a 26-year-old Palestinian asylum seeker wielding a knife stormed into a supermarket in the northern port city of Hamburg, killing one person and wounding six others before being detained by passers-by. A court last month sentenced him to life in prison, finding he had had a “jihadist” motive. ISIS also claimed responsibility for a number of attacks in 2016, including the murder of a teenager in Hamburg, a suicide bombing in the southern city of Ansbach that wounded 15, and an axe attack on a train in Bavaria that left five injured. Germany remains a target for jihadist groups, in particular because of its involvement in the coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and its deployment in Afghanistan since 2001. German troops in the anti-ISIS coalition do not participate in combat operations but support it through reconnaissance, refueling and training. Germany’s security services estimate there are around 10,000 Islamic radicals in Germany, some 1,600 of whom are suspected of being capable of using violence. Merkel has allowed in more than one million asylum seekers in the past two years — a decision that has driven the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which charges that the influx spells a heightened security risk. ISIS also claimed several similar attacks in Europe, including a rampage along Barcelona’s Las Ramblas boulevard in August 2017 that killed 14 and left more than 100 injured. The deadliest such incident in recent years was in the French resort city of Nice in 2016, where a man rammed a truck into a crowd on France’s national July 14 holiday, killing 86 people."
Malaysia arrests two men linked to Islamic State,"KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia has arrested two men believed to have links with militant group Islamic State, including one who allegedly walked around its capital armed with a knife aiming to kill Buddhist monks, police said on Monday. The Muslim-majority Southeast Asian nation has been on high alert since gunmen linked to Islamic State (IS) launched several attacks in Jakarta, the capital of neighbouring Indonesia, in January 2016. The two suspects were arrested in two separate raids in December and January, on suspicion of planning to carry out acts of violence and promoting IS ideology. One of them, an Indonesian who was arrested last week, had allegedly scoured a busy district of the capital, Kuala Lumpur, in November, seeking Buddhist monks to kill, in retaliation for violence suffered by Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. ""The attempt failed, and police managed to confiscate a knife during the raid,"" Mohamad Fuzi Harun, the inspector-general of police, said in a statement. He added that the suspect had also allegedly communicated with a senior IS leader over WhatsApp, had sought to recruit several other Indonesians and put up an IS flag at the building site where he worked. The other suspect, a Malaysian teacher at a private religious school, was detained in December on suspicion of planning an attack on entertainment outlets and to rob, kidnap or kill non-Muslims. The suspect, who had been previously jailed under Malaysia's anti-terror law, had also maintained contact with former members of known terror groups and promoted IS ideology on his Facebook account to recruit new members, police said. Malaysia has arrested hundreds of people over the past few years for suspected links to militant groups. A grenade attack on a bar on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur in June 2016 wounded eight people. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, the first such incident on Malaysian soil."
Islamic State suspect wanted by Malaysia released after questioning: Thai defence ministry,"KUALA LUMPUR: A Thai national wanted by Malaysian police for suspected links to Islamic State (IS) has been released after authorities found no affiliation to the terror group, an official from the Thai defence ministry told Channel NewsAsia on Thursday (Apr 19). It was reported earlier on Thursday that Awae Wae-Eya, 37, had been arrested. “This individual Awae was arrested by authorities. They have questioned him. He is not Islamic State. He has been released,” said Panitan Wattanayagorn, principal security advisor to Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister Prawit Wongsuwan. “He (Awae) has no record of participating in any IS activities. He is just active online, making comments on IS-linked websites,” Panitan told Channel NewsAsia. He did not elaborate on when Awae was arrested and released. According to Malaysian news agency Bernama, he was arrested in Cho Airong district in southern Thailand. Awae hails from Narathiwat province, and is believed to be a former member of southern Thailand’s separatist movement. Malaysian police announced on Monday that they were trying to track him down, along with three other IS-linked suspects over their alleged involvement in a plot to kidnap and kill police officers, as well as attack churches and temples in Johor. A Malaysian security source earlier told Channel NewsAsia that Awae had pledged allegiance to IS leader Abu Bakar al-Baghdadi, and was planning to establish an IS presence in southern Thailand to fund his “jihad.” It marked the first known case of a Thai Malay pledging allegiance to IS. Southern Thailand insurgents have long eschewed IS and other radical groups as their fight is for greater autonomy, not global jihad. Panitan said Thai authorities have also detected several individuals in southern Thailand who have been communicating with people in the Middle East via extremist websites. “But they have not taken part in any real action on the ground (with terrorists). Some of them have been using IS’ name to raise money for themselves,” said Panitan. “Authorities have since shut down several websites,” he added, without elaborating. When contacted, Malaysian police declined to comment on the release of Awae."
Terror suspect planning Islamic State presence in southern Thailand: Malaysian security source,"KUALA LUMPUR: A former member of southern Thailand’s separatist movement, Awae Wae-Eya, 37, is planning to establish an Islamic State (IS) presence in his country with the hope of securing funds from the global terror group to fund his “jihad"", a senior Malaysian security source has told Channel NewsAsia. Southern Thailand’s insurgents have so far eschewed transnational extremist groups, including IS, and its radical teachings as their struggle is for greater autonomy, not global jihad. “Awae pledged allegiance to Abu Bakar al-Baghdadi (leader of IS) and he has contacts in Syria,” the security source told Channel NewsAsia. Awae hails from Thailand's Narathiwat province in the south. He is currently wanted by Malaysian police for planning terror plots in Johor state. The police said on Monday (Apr 16) that they were hunting Awae and three other IS-linked suspects involved in a plot to kidnap and murder police officers, as well as attack non-Muslim places of worship. Awae's ambitions came to light during the Malaysian intelligence gathering operation which led to six other member of an IS cell being arrested by the Johor counter-terrorism unit. However, while Malaysian intelligence suggests Awae has plans to establish an IS presence in southern Thailand, the authorities there played down the current risk. Major-General Sompol Pankul, commander of the Narathiwat Task Force told Channel NewsAsia: ""I don't think Awae is Islamic State."" He did not elaborate.   Isra News Agency of Thailand reported, quoting a security source, that although Awae is not an IS member, he is someone who supports its ideology and way of fighting. However, while there are differing views about Awae, Panitan Wattanayagorn, principal security advisor to Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister General Prawit Wongsuwan, told Channel NewsAsia that local security agencies are attempting to track him down. ""We hope to identify him in the next few days' time, perhaps at the end of the week,"" said Mr Panitan. ""These suspects in the south, including militants, often have dual citizenship and duplicate names, making it difficult to identify them quickly,"" he added. ""To date there are no signs of IS in southern Thailand or of individuals shifting their affiliation from traditional groups to IS."" According to Professor Zachary Abuza of the National War College in Washington DC, if Awae is indeed looking to establish an IS presence in southern Thailand, this would be a significant move. ""The southern Thai groups do not share IS' transnational ideology,"" said Prof Abuza, who has studied the insurgency for years. “There have been signs that this could happen. Thai security forces have found plenty of IS imagery, including flags, videos, and propaganda on insurgent suspects. But that's all it has been, just IS imagery and propaganda,” said Prof Abuza, who specialises in insurgencies and terrorism in Southeast Asia. The Muslim-majority region in the south of Thailand, covering the provinces of Yala, Narathiwat, Pattani and parts of Songkhla, has been a violence-wracked zone for over a decade as ethnic Malay insurgents battle the Buddhist-majority state for greater autonomy.   Don Pathan, an independent security analyst based in Yala, however, says he has not detected any shift to IS from the insurgents there. ""I would say there is lots of curiosity, not sympathy, thus explaining the high number of clicks on websites on IS activities by the Malays in Patani (Thailand’s southernmost provinces),"" said Pathan.  ""Keep in mind that ... groups like Jemaah Islamimah have tried to penetrate the conflict ... but they failed to convince the Patani Malay movements to take up their radical ideology and extremist approach. ""The Patani Malay struggle is etho-nationalist by nature and there is no indication that the political context is changing or has changed,"" Pathan added. Malaysian police said that Awae was plotting to launch terror attacks against churches, temples and a Freemason building in Johor state. The Thai Malay led an IS cell in Johor where he recruited a total of nine Malaysian men, via Facebook and Telegram, to carry out the terror attacks, according to the security source. ""After recruiting the men, Awae came to Malaysia to meet with the men to discuss the (terror) plot, technical matters and weapons,"" he said. “He (Awae) also wanted to kidnap a police officer and take him back to southern Thailand to be killed,” the source added. The attacks and kidnapping were foiled when Malaysian police arrested six members of Awae's cell in a sting operation in Johor. The terror plot was at its final stage, said the source, with the militants waiting for weapons and explosives from southern Thailand to be brought into Johor Bahru. “We now believe Awae is back in southern Thailand,” he said. ISLAMIC STATE WILL HELP FUND THAI SEPARATIST CAUSE? Since 2004, the dispute in southern Thailand has claimed almost 7,000 lives. The slow progress of the 3-year-old peace talks and a sense that the government in Bangkok lacks a sense of urgency have added to restlesness among separatists and a sense of disillusionment, according to Prof Greg Barton of Deakin University. He highlighted how they seek greater autonomy and greater freedom to express their Malay identity. ""The government would like to bring an end to the troubles, and some are beginning to recognize that the longer the issues remain unresolved the greater the risk of some younger activists being drawn towards ISIS-style global jihadi extremism,"" said Prof Barton. Against that backdrop, and based on Malaysia's intelligence gathering, Awae believes IS will advance the insurgents’ cause in southern Thailand, according to the security source. Awae needs large sums of money for his jihadi activities and he believes that he could get financial support from IS, the source said. “Awae believes that he could get funding from Islamic State once he successfully establishes (a branch) of Islamic State in southern Thailand,” he said. Prof Abuza warned of the dangers of IS establishing a foothold in southern Thailand. For Malaysia, it could mean that many IS militants or supporters would have a network in southern Thailand to utilize when they need to lie low, or more importantly, procure weapons, said Prof Abuza. “This has always been the top concern of Malaysian security officials. But Malaysian security officials have always been concerned that actions taken against southern Thai militants - such as arresting leaders or knocking over bomb factories or safe houses - make Malaysia a target in its own right,” Prof Abuza added. On the part of Thailand, its officials have been obsessed by the possibility of the insurgency morphing into an IS threat, said Prof Abuza. “This (morphing) is made easier by their (Thai officials) very poor understanding of the different Islamist strains. But they would only have themselves to blame ... They have proven completely unwilling to address the core political grievances of MARA Patani, the umbrella grouping for the insurgent groups,” he added. Prof Abuza warned of growing radicalism in southern Thailand as a younger generation of militants rise through the ranks. “Most of the insurgents eschew the transnational ideology and the radicalism of IS,” said Prof Abuza. “But do not underestimate the potential for growing radicalism as a younger generation of militants steps into leadership positions.”"
6 Islamic State suspects arrested in Johor for planning attacks on places of worship," KUALA LUMPUR: Seven suspected terrorists have been arrested in Johor and Sabah, said Malaysian police on Saturday (Mar 24).  Six of them, Malaysians from an Islamic State cell, were arrested in Johor for allegedly planning attacks on non-Muslim places of worship and plotting to kill police personnel, while an Abu Sayyaf member was detained in Sabah, said the police in a statement. The men were arrested in multiple operations between Feb 27 and Mar 15. In the first operation, police arrested a 37-year-old man believed to be the mastermind of the planned attacks on places of worship in Johor Bahru. He also actively recruited new militants, said Inspector-General of Police Mohamad Fuzi Harun. ""The second suspect is a 49-year-old security guard and adviser to the terror cell,"" he said, adding that the suspect was in charge of ensuring cell members kept their activities secret. He also gave orders to kill any member who leaked secrets. The third suspect was a 30-year-old security guard who was tasked with acquiring firearms from another country. He also scouted several places of worship across Johor Bahru.  The suspects planned to escape to a neighbouring country to seek refuge with another terror group after carrying out their attacks, said the police chief, without naming the country. Three other members of the same cell were arrested in follow-up operations. One of them was a 25-year-old waiter who had been ordered to kidnap and kill police personnel.  Two other suspects, aged 23 and 22, were arrested on Mar 1 and were working as janitors in Singapore. One of them acted as the intermediary in the purchase of firearms for the cell.  As for the Abu Sayyaf member who was arrested on Mar 15, he is said to be a trusted lieutenant to group leader Furuji Indama and has links to Malaysian militant Mahmud Ahmad. The Filipino man, who is wanted by the Philippines for his involvement in a a kidnap-for-ransom syndicate, is also an expert in making improvised explosive devices. The police chief added that the suspect had planned to carry out several attacks in Sabah and was responsible for making the state a safe haven for terror groups from the Philippines."
 SDF to study any request to hand over British Islamic State militants captured in Syria," AMUDA, Syria/WASHINGTON: The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) has not received a request from any foreign government to hand over two British Islamic State militants in its custody but will study any such request if made, a senior SDF official told Reuters on Friday. ""We have not received any official request from any international party to hand over the two prisoners,"" Redur Xelil, the SDF official, said. Any such request would be studied, he added. U.S. officials said on Thursday that the SDF, a militia force, had last month captured Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee ElSheikh, two of four militants known as the ""Beatles"" for their English accents. They were notorious for their role in the kidnap, torture and killing of Western hostages in Syria. Earlier U.S. and European officials said on Friday that Britain, the United States and officials in the region are discussing what should happen with the two militants. ""Together with our coalition partners, we are still considering options regarding ElSheikh and Kotey, but rest assured there is a common intention to hold anyone accountable who commits acts like those they are alleged to have committed,"" said a spokesman for the U.S. National Security Council. Xelil also confirmed that officials from the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State had taken part in the questioning of the two Britons. Earlier Xelil told Reuters Kotey was captured in a rural area of Raqqa province on Jan. 24 and was aiming to reach Turkey when he was captured by the Kurdish-led forces. ""He was intending to escape towards Turkey with cooperation and coordination with friends of his on the Turkish side,"" Xelil said. ""He is now under investigation with us,"" he said. Xelil gave no information about the second militant, ElSheikh. A senior security official in Turkey, however, accused the SDF of anti-Turkish propaganda, saying it was ""nonsense"" that an Islamic State militant would say they were going to Turkey, and that Ankara was taking every step to eliminate IS militants in Turkey. ""It is not that easy to cross the border without permission. There is a wall as well,"" said the official. The SDF, which is spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, has consistently accused Turkey of supporting Islamic State militants in northern Syria, where the U.S.-led coalition has helped the SDF to drive the jihadists from swathes of territory. In 2016 Turkey launched a military incursion into northern Syria to drive back IS fighters from the border, and it has built a wall along its 911-km (566-mile) frontier to try to halt infiltration. Turkish authorities have also detained hundreds of people across Turkey suspected of being Islamic State members since IS fighters were defeated in the Syrian city of Raqqa in October by the SDF. Turkey views the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought a three-decade insurgency in Turkey and is listed as a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union. It launched an offensive into the Kurdish Afrin region of northwestern Syria on Jan. 20, aiming to crush the YPG. The senior Turkish security official said: ""Turkey is open to joint cooperation, including intelligence, with all its international partners. Turkey has been fighting with IS in every way both inside the country and abroad."" The New York Times reported on Thursday that the British government had revoked the British citizenship of both Kotey and ElSheikh. Britain has taken similar action in the past against dual nationals who left Britain to join militant groups abroad. In the case of a former London resident who joined the Somali militant group al Shabaab, the militant Mahdi Hashi was sent for a federal court trial on terrorism related charges in New York. Hashi pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to provide material support to al Shabaab and was sentenced to nine years in U.S. prison."
Philippine doctor in New York plot charged in kidnap-murder case,"MANILA, Jan 30 — A Philippine doctor accused of wiring money for a foiled New York jihadist plot has been charged in a separate Islamic State-inspired kidnapping and murder case at home, documents released today said. Russel Salic, an orthopaedic surgeon, has been held in custody in the Philippines after US prosecutors charged him over a failed plot to attack New York’s subway, Times Square and concert venues in the name of IS during the Ramadan in 2016. US prosecutors are seeking his extradition. Now Salic and 53 other suspected Filipino extremists have been charged with kidnapping six lumber yard workers in the southern island of Mindanao — killing two of them — to demonstrate their loyalty to the IS movement in the Middle East. The hostages said that in 2016, armed men in the southern island of Mindanao, abducted and tortured them, accusing them of being spies for the military, the Justice Department documents said. The hostages were made to wear orange clothes and photographed. They were told that the pictures would be loaded onto the Internet to show the armed band’s loyalty to IS. Two of the hostages were later beheaded but the rest were freed after their employer negotiated with the kidnappers. The workers said that among their captors was a man who they were told was a doctor but who was only seen guarding and cleaning guns. This man was later identified as Salic, the department said. Salic has insisted he was innocent and said he could prove he was attending a medical convention elsewhere during the incident, the department records showed. However he was still included in the list of 54 accused in the kidnapping and murder case which has been blamed on the Maute group, a local extremist band that has previously pledged allegiance to the IS movement. Only Salic and three other individuals named in the charge sheet are in custody. The Maute group spearheaded the bloody siege of the southern city of Marawi last year that lasted five months and left over a thousand dead, including many of the groups fighters. The Justice Department could not immediately say whether the new charges would affect efforts to extradite Salic to the United States."
Armed men kidnap 15 girls in southeastern Niger,"NIAMEY: Armed men kidnapped 15 girls overnight in southeastern Niger, the local mayor said on Saturday. Boukar Mani Orthe, the mayor of Toumour in Niger's Diffa region near the border with Nigeria, said about 50 unidentified armed men seized the girls in a village about 9 km (6 miles) from the town centre. On Thursday suspected Boko Haram fighters killed eight people working at French drilling company Foraco's water well site in Toumour. Boko Haram has been waging an insurrection since 2009 aimed at establishing an Islamic state in northeast Nigeria. It has launched repeated attacks into neighbouring Niger, Chad and Cameroon. The violence has killed thousands of civilians and forced millions to flee their homes in the large Lake Chad basin region."
Freed Japanese journalist says Syria kidnap ordeal was 'hell',"A Japanese journalist who was held in Syria for more than three years before being freed this week has described his lengthy captivity as ""hell."" Jumpei Yasuda was freed earlier this week and taken to Turkey, where Japanese government officials confirmed his identity before announcing Wednesday that he was free. He boarded a plane bound for Tokyo on Thursday, speaking briefly to journalists in an interview broadcast by Japanese media. ""It was hell,"" he said, sporting a long beard peppered with grey hair. ""Not only physically, but mentally as well. The thought each day that 'I'm not being released today either' left me losing control over myself bit by bit."" Yasuda, who is expected to arrive in Tokyo on Thursday evening, spoke calmly, but appeared slightly overwhelmed and tired, if otherwise healthy. ""For about 40 months, I have not spoken a word of Japanese. Words don't come to my mind easily,"" he said. ""I am happy that I am returning to Japan. At the same time, I have no idea what will happen now and how I should conduct myself. I am at loss and don't know what to think."" Yasuda was kidnapped in Syria in June 2015, and was reportedly initially a hostage of the group previously known as the Al-Nusra Front, a former Al-Qaeda affiliate. But the group's current iteration, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, denied any involvement in his kidnapping in a statement earlier this week. There was only sporadic news of Yasuda throughout his captivity, including a bizarre video that emerged in August showing him and a man identified as an Italian called Alessandro Sandrini. Both men appealed for their release, dressed in orange jumpsuits, as masked, armed men stood behind them. Yasuda gave his name as Omar and described himself as South Korean, but his wife Myu confirmed that it was her husband in the video. The video did not identify who was holding the men or what their demands were. There has been no word on the fate of Sandrini since. Yasuda told journalists he believed he was held for all of his captivity in Idlib, a province in northwestern Syria that is one of the last parts of the country still held in part by rebels and jihadists. The details of how Yasuda was freed have remained murky, with the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, saying a ransom was paid. But Japan's government has denied that. In 2015, militants from the Islamic State group beheaded Japanese war correspondent Kenji Goto and his friend Haruna Yukawa in Syria. The Japanese government was criticised for what detractors saw as its flat-footed response to the crisis at the time, including apparently missed opportunities to free both men. But other Japanese hostages who have been freed and made it home safely have also faced heavy public criticism for what some have deemed reckless behaviour."
 Abu sayyaf men linked to basilan kidnap fall,"After 16 years in hiding, two Abu Sayyaf members who kidnapped 20 workers of a banana plantation in Basilan in 2001were  arrested Friday night.Chief Supt. Billy Beltran, regional director of provincial regional office-9 in Zamboanga City, identified the two  ASG members as Emran Sanduyugan Ismael, alias Bantong Basinti and Bryan Ismail Mahommad, alias Pojong. The two ASG  bandits were facing kidnapping and serious illegal detention for their complicity in numerous criminal acts when subdued by police intelligence operatives inside the Mindpro City Mall in Zamboanga City at about 9:15 p.m. Reports said the bandits were arrested on the strength of a warrant of arrest issued by Judge Leo Jay Principe of the Isabela City Regional Trial Court with no bail recommended. The arrest of Sanduyugan and Ismail brought to nearly dozens of ASG members who participated in the attack and kidnapping of at least 30 workers of Golden Harvest Plantation in Lantawan, Basilan in June 2001. In the said attack, nine civilians were beheaded by the ASG at the height of the kidnapping. The attack also resulted in the death of a worker who was shot by the bandits minutes before fleeing the scene to evade arrest from responding army and police personnel. The arrested ASG militants were positively identified by witnesses whom identities the authorities withheld for security reasons. The ASG operatives are now in the custody of the Zambaonga City Police Station-11 pending their turnover to the appropriate court. Among those already arrested in the Golden Harvest attack by the ASG were Abu Usman who was nabbed at the Port Area of Isabela City in Basilan. In July 2014, another ASG member, Ali Salih, also a culprit in the same incident, was arrested by joint police and military teams in Panigayan village in Malamawi Island, Isabela City. At present, the ASG has been held at bay, not figuring in any terrorist acts following their defeat and the death of their supreme leader and ISIS emir in Southeast Asia, Isnilon Hapilon in the Marawi City bloody siege.Meanwhile, the Islamic State-inspired Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters were reported to be running out of funds and have linked with drug syndicates and is forcing civilians to shell out money in the form of “zakat” (religious tax) to fund its armed operations, Gov. Esmael Mangudadatu said. In an interview, Mangudadatu said the collection of “zakat” is supposedly voluntary and no specific amount a Moro may share for the operation of a local Mosque or place of worship. “But the BIFF has been doing it under duress,” he said. “This is happening in remote villages where poor farmers could not refuse forced taxation, otherwise, they will be harassed.”   Mangudadatu earlier told the Provincial Peace and Order Council, which he chairs, that BIFF members also turned to peddling illegal drugs, selling stuff in and out of Maguindanao.  The BIFF turned to illegal drug syndicates for funds while the drug lords ally with the armed group for protection in the wake of the intensified campaign against illegal drugs and drug personalities. “It is a case of one group benefitting from the other in illegal activities,” the governor said. To contain this problem, Mangudadatu urged the local populace not to give in to BIFF-imposed “zakat.” He urged local officials down to the barangays to help military and police authorities contain the BIFF so their villages would improve. “This is for the benefit of people on the ground. The government cannot do it alone. We need the support of grassroots,” he added. During the PPOC meeting, officials from the affected towns of Shariff Aguak, Datu Unsay, Datu Saudi, Datu Hofer and Datu Salibo complained of forced taxation by the BIFF, informing the governor that many who resisted taxation were executed. The military has repeatedly pounded BIFF positions in Maguindanao in the tri-boundaries of Datu Unsay, Datu Saudi, and Datu Hofer where the BIFF had harassed hundreds of families from Teduray communities since Dec. 25. An estimated 800 Teduray families are currently staying in evacuation centers in the province due to the series of BIFF harassments."
" IS repels US-backed forces from east Syria holdout, reports monitor","BEIRUT, Oct 28 — The Islamic State group has ousted a US-backed coalition of Kurdish and Arab forces from its holdout in eastern Syria, killing dozens of fighters, a monitoring group said today. A Syrian Democratic Forces commander, asking not to be named, confirmed the SDF retreat from the Hajin pocket near the Iraqi border seven weeks into an offensive. The SDF, who are backed by air strikes of the US-led coalition, launched its campaign to retake the IS holdout on September 10. But they have faced a fierce fightback from the jihadists, including under the cover of sandstorms, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says. “In counterattacks since Friday to Sunday dawn, IS has taken back all positions to which the SDF had advanced inside the Hajin pocket,” the monitoring group’s chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. The Observatory reported 72 SDF fighters killed, as IS took advantage of the storm that hampered coalition air cover and dispatched suicide bombers as part of their fightback. The SDF commander told AFP that his forces had faced a “strong dust storm” and lacked local knowledge of the terrain. Unlike IS, “our forces don’t know the area and can’t move around in conditions of zero visibility,” he said. “Military reinforcements and heavy weapons have been sent to the front and some units will be replaced by more experienced ones,” the commander said. “We will launch a new military campaign as soon as those reinforcements have arrived,” he said. More than 300 SDF fighters and around 500 IS jihadists have been killed in the past seven weeks of fighting, the Observatory says. The coalition estimates that 2,000 IS fighters remain in the Hajin area. IS overran large swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq in 2014, proclaiming a “caliphate” across land it controlled. But the jihadist group has since lost most of that territory to various offensives in both countries. In Syria, its presence has been reduced to parts of the vast Badia desert also in the east and the Hajin pocket. A total of more than 360,000 people have been killed since Syria’s war erupted in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests."
"Manhunt for four with IS links, said to be planning attacks on houses of worship and police"," KUALA LUMPUR, April 16 — Federal police have launched a manhunt for four men, including a Thai national, with suspected links to the Islamic State (IS) militant group, who are said to be planning attacks on non-Muslim houses of worship as well as the police force. Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi Harun in a statement today revealed the identity of the four suspects. “They are considered dangerous as they plan to kidnap and murder police personnel. “We urge the public to immediately alert the police as to their whereabouts as they are capable of launching attacks that threaten national security,” he said. He added that the suspects were part of a 10-man terror cell network whose other members were arrested by the Special Branch Counter-Terrorism Unit in Johor between February 27 and March 1 this year. The first and second suspect, both from Tumpat, Kelantan, have been identified as 29-year-old Muhamad Faizal Muhamad Hanafi and 51-year-old Muhamad Hanafi Yah. The third suspect is Nor Farkhan Mohd Isa, 31, from Skudai, Johor, while the fourth suspect has been named as 37-year-old Awae Wae-Eya from Narathiwat, Thailand. Mohamad Fuzi also warned that anyone with knowledge of the suspects’ whereabouts was punishable by imprisonment of between seven and 30 years. Those with information on the four men are urged to contact the investigating officer, Inspector Mohd Badri Othman of the Special Branch Counter-Terrorism Department, at 017-6727120, Bukit Aman or the nearest police station."
10 sentenced to jail for planned Barcelona attacks,"MADRID, April 10 — Ten members of a jihadist cell linked to the Islamic State group (IS) who planned attacks in Barcelona and to film a decapitation were sentenced to 8-12 years in jail today. The defendants included five Moroccans, four Spaniards and a Brazilian, the National Court, which handles terror cases, said in a ruling. They were “ready to wage an attack against institutions such as the police, banks or Jewish institutions in Spain at any time, or to join the ranks of Daesh,” it added, using the Arabic acronym for IS. The cell was based in Terrassa, not far from Barcelona, the Catalonian capital. Last year, another jihadist group killed 16 people in attacks there and on the nearby popular seaside city of Cambrils. The 10, whose cell was called “Islamic Fraternity, Group for preaching jihad,” were sentenced for “belonging to a terrorist organisation’” the court said. The three leaders of the group were given 12 years in jail while the seven others got eight years. In March 2015, the main leader of the cell, a Spaniard who had converted to Islam, proposed to kidnap and decapitate an “infidel” whom he had already identified, film the killing and then broadcast the video online before fleeing to Syria. He had previously proposed that the group “commit an attack against the Catalan parliament, which no one had objected to,” according to the court ruling. “He also justified decapitations and talked about making handmade bombs to commit attacks.” Police found documents calling for jihad at his home and books on European organisations such as the Basque separatist group ETA or Germany’s far-left Red Army Faction, the ruling said. Members of the cell had also gone on a recce in Barcelona, the Catalonian capital, where they took photos of the train station, a luxury seaside hotel, a shopping mall and a police station. One member went to Syria in April 2014 and died in Fallujah in Iraq the following year. Three others tried to follow in his footsteps at the end of 2014 but were detained at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey. According to the interior ministry, close to a third of all arrests for “jihadist terrorism” in Spain were made in Catalonia last year."
Military validating reports on new ISIS 'emir' from Lanao del Sur,"MANILA - The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) said Tuesday it is still validating reports that a new leader or ""emir"" of the Islamic State in Southeast Asia has emerged from Lanao del Sur. ""The recruitment, reorganizing and regrouping has been going on. It has been going on immediately after, or before the actual Marawi incident happened. So all of these areas, especially the urban areas, places where congestion can happen, we are monitoring it, closely monitoring it through our field units"" Brig. Gen. Bienvenido Datuin, Chief of the AFP Civil Relations Service, told reporters. He was making reference to the five-month siege of Marawi City last year, led by Islamic State-linked terrorists. Maj. Ronald Suscano, spokesperson of the Philippine Army's 1st Infantry Division, was quoted in reports Monday that Abu Dar, a native of Pagayawan town in Lanao del Sur, has succeeded Isnilon Hapilon. Hapilon, said to be the anointed emir of the Islamic State in Southeast Asia, was killed in military offensives in October last year along with terror leader Omar Maute. Both were tagged in the Marawi siege. The reports said Abu Dar was a money courier during the Marawi siege. Suscano described him to be more radical than Hapilon and is known to have connections with foreign terrorists. Datuin said remnants of ISIS-linked terror groups pursued aspirations of their predecessors, which is to establish a caliphate in the Philippines. ""He has the resources, he was able to bring that along within and of course, sabi ko, 'yung leadership skills niya, it may be possible that this may guide them into forming another group and plan another big event or big activity,"" Datuin told reporters."
"Doctor linked to Maute group charged with kidnapping, murder","MANILA - The Department of Justice (DOJ) has indicted a doctor linked to the Maute group and wanted in the United States for allegedly helping finance foiled attacks in New York City for the Islamic State in 2016. Dr. Russel Langi Salic was charged with 4 counts of kidnapping and serious illegal detention and 4 counts of kidnapping and serious illegal detention with murder. Fifty-three others were also indicted before the Malabang, Lanao del Sur Regional Trial Court Branch 11. The case stemmed from a complaint filed by Gabriel Permitis, Alfredo Cano-os, Adonis Mendez, and Julito Janubas, who accused respondents of abducting them at a sawmill in Barangay Sandab, Butig, Lanao del Sur on April 4, 2016. The accused also allegedly abducted a certain Jaymart Capangpangan and Salvador Janubas, whom they beheaded six days later. The indictments were ordered in a 23-page resolution issued by Senior Assistant State Prosecutor Peter Ong, and approved by OIC-Senior Deputy State Prosecutor Amor Robles, and acting Prosecutor-General Jorge Catalan. The resolution gave weight to the kidnap victims’ testimonies that they saw Salic cleaning and guarding firearms in the place where they were held captive. They also alleged having overheard him give instructions to their captives to make sure they would not escape. The victims identified the accused as members of the Maute group, which waged attacks in Marawi City on May 23 last year, leading President Duterte to place the entire Mindanao under martial law."
"Malaysia detains 7 militants planning to kidnap, kill cops","Malaysia has detained seven militants suspected of planning attacks in the country, in several raids in Johor and Sabah. Members of a clandestine terror cell, which included two men working as janitors in Singapore, were planning to kidnap and kill policemen and attack non-Muslim houses of worship, police said in a statement yesterday. The plot was uncovered after Malaysian counter-terrorism police, aided by their Singaporean counterparts, detained the terror suspects in a series of swoops between Feb 27 and March 15. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said in a statement on Sunday that the authorities picked up the two Malaysians working in Singapore, who were said to be involved in terrorist plots in Malaysia, for investigations after they received information from the Malaysian authorities. ""Both men were handed over to the Malaysian authorities after our investigations showed that they did not pose a security threat to Singapore,” the statement said. The order to kidnap and kill policemen was the first of its kind, according to an intelligence source. ""This cell is extremely cautious... they are vengeful against the police, especially those from E8 (counter terrorism),"" an intelligence source told The Sunday Times. In a statement yesterday, Malaysia's police chief Mohamad Fuzi Harun said six suspects who were detained in Johor were members of an Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) cell. In the first round of arrests on Feb 27, three men were nabbed, with the main suspect being a 37-year-old technician who masterminded the plans to attack places of worship in Johor Baru. He was also actively recruiting new militants. Police picked up another three members of the same cell in follow-up sweeps on Feb 28. He said: ""The fourth suspect, a 25-year-old waiter, had been ordered by the mastermind to kidnap and kill policemen. ""Two others, aged 23 and 22, were arrested on March 1 and worked as janitors in Singapore. "" According to a Malaysian intelligence source, the two were arrested by Singaporean counterparts before they were handed over to the Malaysian police. ""Singapore was informed of the duo's alleged involvement in terrorism by Malaysia. They then tracked down and arrested the men before handing them over to the authorities here,"" the source said. The seventh suspect was a 31-year-old, said to be a ""trusted lieutenant"" in the Abu Sayyaf group in the Philippines. He was detained in Sabah on March 15. ""The Filipino man is a trusted lieutenant to Furuji Indama, the group's leader based in Basilan. ""We believe the suspect has connections to Malaysian militant, Dr Mahmud Ahmad, and is also wanted by the Philippine authorities for involvement in a kidnap-for-ransom syndicate. He is an expert in making improvised explosive devices and had planned to attack several locations in Sabah,"" Mr Fuzi said. Malaysia has arrested nearly 400 people since 2013 for suspected links to terrorism. The Muslim-majority nation faces threats from self-radicalised ISIS sympathisers at home, and regional militant groups which seek funding and refuge in South-east Asia. The country's first and only terrorist attack took place in June 2016, when two men on a motorcycle lobbed a grenade into a nightclub in Selangor, injuring eight people. The men were sentenced to 25 years' jail."
" Philippines files murder, kidnap charges against doctor linked to planned New York attacks","MANILA: The Philippine justice ministry has filed charges of murder and kidnapping against a doctor linked to a foiled plot to mount gun and bomb attacks in the heart of New York City, over his role in the abduction of six sawmill workers in a southern province. Prosecutors had set aside the alibi of Russel Salic, who said he was at a doctors' convention in another Philippine province when pro-Islamic State Maute militants kidnapped six sawmill workers and beheaded two of them in April 2016. ""Criminal liability exists, notwithstanding non-participation in every detail in the execution of the crime,"" prosecutors said in a document recommending charges against Salic and Maute militants. Reuters could not immediately reach Salic, his lawyer or other representatives by telephone or email to seek comment. The 37 year-old doctor has been detained at a maximum security facility in the capital, Manila, after he surrendered to authorities last year. In sworn statements, four sawmill workers said that while in captivity, they had seen Salic cleaning guns in a room full of weapons and that he had asked some of the militants to give them food and coffee. In his defence, Salic disputed the sawmill workers' story, insisting he was at an orthopedic convention and showing pictures to back up his account. But prosecutors ignored his alibi, saying the workers had no reason to fabricate stories. At about the time of the 2016 abduction, Salic, who had expressed support for Islamic State on social media, sent about US$423 from the Philippines to an FBI undercover officer to help pay for the attacks in New York, documents unsealed in a U.S. federal court show. U.S. authorities filed criminal charges against the 37-year-old doctor in October last year and wanted him extradited along with Pakistani Talha Haroon, who was also linked to the bomb plot in Manhattan's Times Square. But Salic could not immediately be sent to the United States because he faced charges of murder and kidnapping, along with 53 other pro-Islamic State militants, in the regional trial court in the southern Philippines. The justice department said the mother of the Maute brothers who led the militants' takeover of Marawi City for five months from May last year, was also charged. Some of Salic's co-accused had been killed in Marawi, including seven Maute brothers. Reuters could not immediately reach Omita Maute for comment."
"Talk to Abu Sayyaf, Australian kidnap victim urges gov’t","ZAMBOANGA CITY — Like President Rodrigo Duterte, Australian kidnap victim Warren Rodwell said he favored talking to Abu Sayyaf bandits to determine what they really wanted, hoping to stop the group’s criminal activities. “I don’t want the Philippine government to kill or hurt my captors. The way to reach to them is to talk to them. If they are arrested, don’t kill [them]; put them behind bars,” Rodwell said through a Facebook chat on Sunday. Rodwell issued the statement after learning that Nurhassan Jamiri, the leader of the group that abducted him in 2011, had yielded to the military. The Basilan-based Jamiri surrendered to soldiers in Hadji Mohammad Ajul town on March 28 together with 13 Abu Sayyaf men, according to Lt. Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr., commander of the Western Mindanao Command. Jamiri and his men also turned in their firearms. The surrender took place two days after Mr. Duterte visited Patikul town in Sulu province and urged Abu Sayyaf bandits to yield and talk to him. Galvez described Jamiri’s surrender as a product of a successful negotiation and collaboration between government troops and local officials led by Basilan Gov. Jim Saliman Hataman, Isabela City Vice Mayor Cherilyn Akbar and Ustadz Hud Limaya, deputy commander of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front’s 114th Base Command. The latest surrender had brought to 202 the number of bandits who had turned themselves in since martial law was declared in Mindanao in May last year after Islamic State-inspired terror groups laid siege to Marawi City, Galvez added. Rodwell, who said he nearly died in captivity due to blood loss from a bullet wound, welcomed the surrender of Jamiri and the government’s commitment to provide them livelihood and housing. “Forgiveness and acceptance … I have no ill feelings against any of my … captors,” he said. Rodwell said people might question his position on the Abu Sayyaf problem, but he wanted to make them understand that the likes of Jamiri “were born into that situation (lawlessness).” Rodwell said the planned reintegration program for Abu Sayyaf bandits who surrendered to the government “sound[ed] wonderful.” “We can only hope that Abu Sayyaf members in custody are also trained for their own benefit,” he said. “Which is more important for society? Punishment or rehabilitation? Are these people any less human than we think we are?” He said it was not enough to simply identify a social problem, but “it’s more important to look at ways of minimizing or eliminating the impact of such.” Rodwell, however, said he would not drop the charges he filed against Jamiri and his other captors. “I’d leave it to the court. I’ll let it undergo the normal proceedings,” he said."
"Taliban reject Afghan ceasefire, kidnap nearly 200 bus passengers","Peshawar, Pakistan, (ANTARANews) - The Taliban rejected on Monday an Afghan government offer of a ceasefire and said they would persist with their attacks, militant commanders said, while insurgents ambushed three buses and nearly 200 passengers travelling for a holiday. Two Taliban commanders said their supreme leader rejected President Ashraf Ghani`s Sunday offer of a three-month ceasefire, beginning with this week`s Eid al-Adha Muslim holiday. In June, the Taliban observed a government ceasefire over the three-day Eid al-Fitr festival, leading to unprecedented scenes of government soldiers and militants embracing on front lines, and raising hopes for talks. But one of the Taliban commanders said the June ceasefire had helped U.S. forces, who the Taliban are trying to drive out of the country. Taliban leader Sheikh Haibatullah Akhunzada rejected the new offer on the grounds that it too would only help the American-led mission. ""Our leadership feels that they`ll prolong their stay in Afghanistan if we announced a ceasefire now,"" a senior Taliban commander, who declined to be identified, said by telephone. An official in Ghani`s office said the three-month-long ceasefire declared by the government was conditional, and if the Taliban did not respect it, the government would maintain military operations. The Taliban have launched a wave of attacks in recent weeks, including on the city of Ghazni, southwest of Kabul. Hundreds of people have been killed in the fighting. Government officials are trying to secure the release of at least 170 civilians and 20 members of the security forces who were taken hostage by Taliban from three buses in the northern province of Kunduz. Esmatullah Muradi, a spokesman for the governor of Kunduz, said the kidnapping happened when the buses were travelling through Kunduz from Takhar province. ""The buses were stopped by the Taliban fighters, passengers were forced to step down and they have been taken to an undisclosed location,"" Muradi said. A Taliban commander in Afghanistan said civilian hostages were being divided into small groups to be sent back home. However, members of Afghan security forces had been shifted to the Talibans secret jail. ""Most probably we would exchange them for our prisoners later, said the commander. ""Travelling for holidary The Taliban confirmed they had captured ""three buses packed with passengers"". ""We decided to seize the buses after our intelligence inputs revealed that many men working with Afghan security forces were travelling to Kabul,"" Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, said by telephone, as reported by Reuters. ""We are now identifying members of the security forces,"" he said, adding that civilians would be released. Kunduz provincial council member Sayed Assadullah Sadat said people on the buses were travelling to be with family in Kabul for the holiday. A senior interior ministry official in Kabul said officials in the area were talking to Taliban leaders in Kunduz to get the estimated 190 hostages released. ""We`re are trying our level best to secure freedom for all passengers,"" the official said. Separately, Mujahid said the Taliban would release at least 500 prisoners, including members of the security forces, on Monday, a day before Eid celebrations begin. Sporadic clashes between Taliban fighters and Afghan forces erupted on the outskirts of Ghazni on Monday as aid workers tried to get help into the city, aid agency officials said. The government has said its forces had secured the city after the Taliban laid siege to it for five days this month. At least 150 soldiers and 95 civilians were killed and hundreds were injured. Aid agencies officials said their teams had entered the city but clashes in the outskirts prevented them from launching large-scale operations."
Taliban kidnap 3 passenger buses in Afghan northern Kunduz province,"Kunduz, Afghanistan, (ANTARANews) - Taliban militants kidnapped three passenger buses along with more than 150 passengers in Khan Abad district of Afghanistan`s northern Kunduz province on Monday, district governor Hayatullah Amiri said. ""The incident took place at 4:00 a.m. local time and the Taliban rebels forcibly took the buses to the villages under their control,"" Amiri told Xinhua. He said security forces had launched operations to ensure the safe release of the abducted passengers. Safiullah Mahzon deputy to Kunduz police chief has also confirmed the abduction of passenger buses, saying efforts are underway to set the hostages free. The abduction occurred just a day after Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani announced a three-month conditional ceasefire starting from Monday calling upon Taliban outfit to follow suit. Taliban group has yet to response to the government`s ceasefire offer."
Nigeria marks four-year anniversary of Chibok kidnap,"LAGOS, April 14 — Nigeria today marked four years since Boko Haram abducted more than 200 schoolgirls from the remote town of Chibok, with renewed calls for their release and that of thousands of others seized in the bloody conflict. A total of 219 girls were taken from the Government Girls Secondary School in the remote town in Borno state on the evening of April 14, 2014 and have become an enduring symbol of the Islamist insurgency. Four years on, 112 are still being held. Last night, about 100 people attended a vigil in Nigeria’s biggest city, Lagos, under a busy flyover whose pillars are now adorned with brightly painted murals of the missing girls. “We are here to show (the) government that we are still missing our sisters,” Zakaria Galang, a brother of one of the students who is yet to return, told AFP. Further events are planned in the capital, Abuja, today. Nigeria’s president in 2014, Goodluck Jonathan, was heavily criticised for his response to the abduction but the man who replaced him, Muhammadu Buhari, has had more success. Since 2016, 107 girls have been found, released or escaped as part of a government deal with Boko Haram and the administration has said back-channel talks are ongoing for further releases and a possible end to the wider conflict. Another activist, Habiba Balogun, said she hoped that would happen after nearly nine years of violence that has left at least 20,000 dead and made more than 2.6 million homeless. “The government has said that they are ready to negotiate; they want to bring this nightmare to an end,” she said. Buhari pledged to the Chibok girls’ parents that their daughters “will never be forgotten or abandoned to their fate” despite the time that had passed. The former military ruler has repeatedly claimed Boko Haram was virtually defeated but while there have been clear army gains, security threats remain. In February, fighters loyal to a Boko Haram faction headed by Abu Mus’ab al-Barnawi seized 112 schoolgirls and one boy from the town of Dapchi, in Yobe state. One hundred and seven were returned in mid-March. Five reportedly died, while one girl — the only Christian in the group — is still being held. Buhari said the return of so many students from Dapchi and Chibok “should give confidence that all hope is not lost” and showed the government was “doing its very best”. There had been “unexpected setbacks” in talks because of infighting within Boko Haram. But he added: “We will continue to persist, and the parents should please not give up. Don’t give up hope of seeing our daughters back home again.” Boko Haram has used kidnapping as a weapon of war during the conflict, seizing women and girls to act as sex slaves or suicide bombers, and men and boys to fight. UNICEF said this week more than 1,000 children had been verified as abducted in northeast Nigeria since 2013, although the real figure is estimated to be much higher. Amnesty International’s Nigeria director, Osai Ojigho, said the Chibok abduction was a small part of a bigger issue. The government needed to deliver “meaningful action on behalf of all these victims of Boko Haram’s crimes”. “Far more support must also be provided for past victims,” she said, proposing a register for abducted people. The International Crisis Group meanwhile said the copycat abduction in Dapchi showed more needed to be done to protect schoolchildren in the restive region. “The abductions illustrate that Boko Haram remains a menace to swathes of northeast Nigeria,” it added in a report published on Thursday. “They throw into doubt the government’s claim to have defeated the movement; instead, insurgents may be newly emboldened to keep fighting. “The kidnappings cast a pall over education, particularly of girls, and thus the prospects for socio-economic development of the region.”"
Easy for them to blend in': Foreign terror suspects pose security challenges for Malaysian authorities,"KUALA LUMPUR: When Malaysian police announced the arrest of eight terror suspects last Friday (Nov 16), it highlighted a particular problem authorities here face. That of foreigners entering Malaysia legally but who then go on to pursue militant activities. Seven of the eight suspects arrested last week were Filipinos, with some of them working in the country as labourers or construction workers in the eastern state of Sabah. The police said they were suspected of various activities, including recruiting children in the Philippines to be used as human shields and kidnap-for-ransom activities. The latest raids brought the total number of terror suspects arrested in Malaysia since 2013 to 445. More than a quarter of them - 128 - were foreigners. Some of these foreigners were directly involved in a number of attacks that were being planned by extremists, according to authorities. “We have foiled 23 terror attacks since 2013 - out of which three of those plots involved foreigners,” Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay, head of Malaysia's Special Branch counter-terrorism division, told Channel NewsAsia. The three plots, involving two Filipinos and two Indonesians, were disrupted in 2015, 2017 and 2018, said Ayob, who declined to elaborate further. Last year, Malaysian police said they had foiled a plan by the Abu Sayyaf Group to attack the closing ceremony of the Southeast Asian Games in Kuala Lumpur. The foreign suspects who have been arrested over the years have either been members or had ties with Islamic State (IS), Al-Qaeda, Pakistan’s Lashkar e-Taiba - the group behind the 2008 Mumbai attack - Abu Sayyaf, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and others. Filipinos comprised the largest group of foreign militants with 46 suspects detained, most of whom were alleged to be from the Abu Sayyaf, Ayob said. Indonesians represent the second largest group with 35 people arrested. Of the 445 terror suspects arrested since 2013, 189 suspects were charged in court with 161 of those convicted and jailed. Another 114 were freed, while 50 foreign terror suspects were deported, said the Special Branch. With police constantly on the trail of suspected foreign terror suspects, experts suggest that there are a number of factors which make Malaysia a popular destination for extremists looking to pursue activities outside their own countries. ""Malaysia is regarded as a Muslim-friendly country; also, visas are not needed for some Middle Easterners. This is exploited by foreign terrorist fighters,"" said counter-terrorism expert Ahmad el-Muhammady. ""And it's easy for them to blend in given the fact that many Middle Eastern communities are in Malaysia."" He added: ""There should also be better vetting of arrivals from Arab countries with well-trained (immigration) officers (who can speak) Arabic."" A former intelligence official, who investigated the 9/11 operatives who came to  Malaysia in 1999, told Channel NewsAsia it was not surprising that Al-Qaeda members were still coming to Malaysia. ""It shouldn't surprise us anymore,"" he said, requesting anonymity. ""It's easy to enter this country and lie low for a period of time. It could also suggest they have a support network here."" Foreign terrorists come to Malaysia for myriad reasons: Some are on the run from authorities in their own countries, some are seeking to raise funds. “Terror groups like Al-Qaeda have their own funds while JI and IS exploit the issue of oppression against Muslims to collect funds in Malaysia,” said Ayob. Adding to the challenge for the intelligence forces is the suspicion that Malaysia’s borders are more porous than they should be because of corrupt officials who do not conduct the proper security checks. ""It is imperative for the government to look into corruption at the entry and exit points of the country,"" said counter-terrorism expert Ahmad. In March 2017, police arrested an immigration officer in Sandakan, Sabah who allegedly helped arrange for IS militants from Indonesia and Malaysia to enter the eastern state before heading on to southern Philippines. And in September this year, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission arrested six immigration officers who allegedly assisted about 15 human smuggling syndicates to enable blacklisted locals and foreigners, including hardcore criminals, to enter and exit via Kuala Lumpur International Airport and other international airports in the country. On Nov 15, Malaysian police said that shortcomings in the immigration department's e-visa system had resulted in some people being allowed to enter the country despite being blacklisted or having criminal records. Deputy inspector-general of police Noor Rashid Ibrahim was quoted by Bernama as saying the weaknesses could pose a major threat to the country. ""So far, we are still collecting information and making analysis,"" he said. ""When the information is enough, we will conduct a special operation."" Recent arrests have shown that some terror suspects have managed to live and work undetected for years before being caught by police. Some of them set up their own companies either to hide their activities or to eke out a living while on the run from authorities back home. Others have worked as security guards, construction workers or petty traders. At least seven Abu Sayyaf members were working as security guards when they were arrested, according to police. The Philippines-based Abu Sayyaf is an IS-linked kidnap-for-ransom group known for beheading its victims when they fail to pay ransoms. Some foreign militants have worked as teachers spreading radical Salafi jihadi teachings, which underpin global terrorist groups like IS and Al-Qaeda. On Sep 24, police arrested seven foreigners and one Malaysian for spreading Salafi jihadi teachings in the northern state of Perlis. The foreigners comprised five Europeans, one American and a Middle Easterner. The threat from foreign extremists who are Al-Qaeda members or those who have links with the organisation is a growing concern for Malaysian authorities. Last October, the Special Branch arrested a 50-year-old former Al-Qaeda member in Selangor. The detained Egyptian suspect was an executive manager in an advertising company that he had set up. His firm promotes a property company from a Gulf state. “At this point, we only know that he set up his own company here. Investigations are still ongoing,” said counter-terrorism chief Ayob. Inspector-General of Police Mohd Fuzi Harun also said that the suspect had previously been jailed in Canada and Egypt for his involvement in terror activities and for using fake travel documents. “We need to conduct operations to disrupt Al-Qaeda because they have tried to use Malaysia as a base to plot their terror attacks,” said Ayob. ""Previously, the operatives of the 9/11 attacks quietly entered Malaysia in December 1999 to discuss the plot and then left and made their way to the US to carry out the attack in 2001."" In 1995, a senior Al-Qaeda member, Wali Khan Amin Shah, a co-conspirator in the plot to blow up 12 US-registered airliners in Asia, was also arrested in Malaysia. “Wali Khan had set up a company in Malaysia named Konsojaya Sendirian Berhad as a cover for his terror activities in Malaysia,” said Ayob, who investigated the case. Ayob warned of an Al-Qaeda resurgence as he called for vigilance. ""We have intel that shows that Al-Qaeda is strengthening its forces and their strategy is to be active again after the fall of IS.”"
"Maute group sniper nabbed by police in Cubao, QC","A hardcore sniper of the Islamic State-inspired Maute terrorist who survived in the last leg of the liberation of Marawi City last year was arrested by police operatives in Cubao, Quezon City Monday. The arrest came 15 days before the Marawi City siege anniversary. National Capital Region Police Office director Camilo Cascolan identified the Maute terrorist as Unday Macadato, who was collared by police operatives at his safehouse along Felix Manalo Street at 4:55 p.m. PNP Chief Oscar Albayalde along with Cascolan presented Unday to the media Tuesday morning in Camp Crame. Cascolan said the arrest of Unday were effected following a tip from an anonymous informant who reported a gun-toting man threatening passersby, bystanders and neighbors at his supposed hideout. Cascolan immediately dispatched police and intelligence units from the NCRPO headquarters led by Insp. Segundino Bulan and Supt. Andres Simbajon Jr. who went to the said address and eventually arrested Macadato. The Maute terrorist was in possession of a firearm and an explosive and tried to resist but was subdued by police operatives. Cascolan confirmed that Macadato was indeed n Maute member and is listed in the Martial Law Instruction No. 1.Reports said that Macadato was among the nearly thousands of combined Abu Sayyaf Group led by the late Isnilon Hapilon and Maute group who launched a simultaneous attack in Marawi City in May 23, 2017.Authorities could not yet establish as when and how Macadato was able to slip out at the main battle zone despite a heavy cordon put up by composite security forces at the height of the final chapter of Marawi City. The last bastion of the Maute group was decimated on October 23, the day President Rodrigo Duterte declared the liberation of Marawi from the clutches of the terrorists. Several hundreds of terrorists, soldiers and civilian hostages were killed during the siege. Both the military and police are still hunting the remnants of the terrorist group involved in the Marawi City siege who arebelieved hiding either in Lanao del Sur and adjoining provinces in Mindanao or in Metro Manila. Cascolan expressed his gratitude to the public for their trust and confidence to the police leading to the arrest of Macadato. “Immediate reporting of significant information. Concerns/complaints of the public to the police and the quick appropriate response of the police will eventually yield positive results,” Cascolan said."
 30 ISIS-inspired terrorists nabbed in Mindanao,"TACURONG CITY—Government troops and police arrested 30 Islamic State-inspired terrorists in a surprise commando-type offensive deep into their lair in the lakeshore town of Lutayan in Sultan Kudarat province, officials said Sunday. Police Supt. James Gulmatico, Sultan Kudarat police provincial director, said the operation by the 4th Special Action Battalion of the Police Special Action Force and the 33rd Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army, took place in Markadz, Barangay Sisiman, Lutayan.  Gulmatico said the arrested men were being interrogated, and that the police will provide further updates later. Seized from the extremists were one M-16 automatic rifle; three homemade shotguns; two rifle grenade; two hand-held two-way radios, an improvised bomb with coiled electrical wire, a cellular phone for a triggering device, and nails. News of the successful raid came a day before Armed Forces chief Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr. opened the Balikatan joint Philippine-US military exercises on Monday. Galvez, who headed the overall Philippine military operations against the IS-inspired extremists in Marawi City, acknowledged how the US forces provided Filipino counterparts with “intelligence support in real time,” as well as ammunition, and other resources like rubber boats, firepower, and capability training.A lakeshore city, Lutayan town sits on a southern shore of Lake Buluan, similar to Marawi. In both cases, local officials were unaware of the presence of the extremists. Australia and Japan on Monday joined the humanitarian operations component of Balikatan 34, which is being held from May 7 to 18 in multiple locations in Luzon. The participating forces have already conducted a series of community engagement activities since April 19, the US Embassy said in a statement."
Kidnap release in Nigeria raises truce hopes in jihadist revolt,"As the Dapchi schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram were finally reuniting with their families, Nigeria delivered a small bombshell: it revealed it had begun ceasefire talks with the notorious jihadists. The talks began months ago, according to officials. But, to those desperate for a breakthrough in the bloody insurgency, they also caution that divisions among the militants may well hamper progress toward peace — and analysts say similar initiatives have foundered in the past. “Government is ever ready to accept the unconditional laying down of arms by any member of the Boko Haram group who show strong commitment,” President Muhammadu Buhari said on Friday when he met the schoolgirls in Abuja, the national capital. “We are ready to rehabilitate and integrate such repented member(s) into the larger society,” said Buhari. “This country has suffered enough of hostilities.” A total of 111 schoolgirls were abducted by Boko Haram from the northeastern town of Dapchi on February 19 in the largest mass kidnapping since 2014 when over 200 schoolgirls were taken from Chibok. In a scene that shocked many Nigerians, the jihadists returned to the town in an unobstructed convoy, flying the black Boko Haram flag, to drop off most of the girls. Six girls are still missing, including one who was held back for refusing to renounce Christianity. The five others are believed to have died in the initial stages of the kidnapping. Information Minister Lai Mohammed said that a week-long ceasefire was declared on March 19 as part of “intense back channel” negotiations to allow Boko Haram to return the hostages. The Nigerian government has repeatedly denied paying a ransom or releasing imprisoned Boko Haram fighters in exchange for the schoolgirls. “The insurgents’ only condition was their demands for a cessation of hostilities and a temporary ceasefire to enable them to return the girls (to) the point they picked them (up),” explained Lawal Daura, a senior security official, on Friday. The talks with Boko Haram explored the “permanent, possible cessation of hostilities” and the “possibility of granting amnesty to repentant insurgents,” Daura said. But he warned that achieving success would be “problematic” since the group is splintered into rival camps. A source close to the Dapchi negotiations told AFP that the government has been negotiating with the Islamic State-affiliated Abu Mus’ab al-Barnawi faction of Boko Haram. Al-Barnawi, the son of deceased Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf, leads one faction, while Abubakar Shekau, Yusuf’s former deputy, leads another. “Talks have been ongoing between the government and the insurgents from the Al-Barnawi faction,” said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. The source said peace talks began in earnest after the July 2017 ambush on an oil exploration team in Lake Chad that killed at least 69 people. “The major headache now is extending the talks to the Shekau faction which is averse to negotiations,” said the source. Striking a deal with one faction doesn’t guarantee that the other faction will follow, said security analyst Ryan Cummings. “You’re not talking to a homogenous, centralised insurgent group,” said Cummings. “Boko Haram is an umbrella movement comprised of various factions motivated for different reasons, some ideological, others profit, some might be a combination.” Others fear that the talks are being used as a diversion by Boko Haram to regroup. “The military is opposed to negotiations with the militant groups, especially on release of hostages, which is believed to mostly involve ransom payment,” said another source close to the talks. “The military sees Boko Haram using the halt to buy time.” It’s not the first time Nigeria has talked about a ceasefire with Boko Haram. In 2014, former president Goodluck Jonathan’s government claimed it had brokered a deal with the militants, though Boko Haram attacks continued quickly soon after. Then, as now, experts questioned the legitimacy and influence of the rebel negotiators. Shortly after being elected in 2015, Buhari said he was mulling amnesty for Boko Haram fighters. “If the Boko Haram leadership eventually agrees to turn over the Chibok girls to us — the complete number — then we may decide to give them (the prisoners) amnesty,” said Buhari at the time. “We’ve had previous conversations about ceasefire that turned out to be illusions,” said political analyst Chris Ngwodo. “The distinction here is that this appears to be a specific initiative targeted at a specific faction of Boko Haram,” said Ngwodo. “Perhaps for the first time, at least publically, the federal government is trying to exploit the factions.”"
India confirms deaths of 39 workers abducted in Iraq,"The bodies of 39 Indian construction workers kidnapped in Iraq in 2014 by the Islamic State group have been found in a mass grave, India's foreign minister said Tuesday. Sushma Swaraj told the upper house of parliament the workers had been murdered by IS. Their bodies had been found in the grave in the village of Badush northwest of the city of Mosul and taken to a local organization for DNA testing. ""Yesterday they told us that 38 samples had matched. The 39th had a partial match as he didn't have any immediate family,"" said Swaraj. The workers were abducted in June 2014 when IS jihadists overran large swathes of territory in Iraq and captured Mosul. The government had for years insisted they were believed still alive and the latest announcement sparked criticism from some relatives of the dead. The victims were mostly from poor families in India's northern state of Punjab and had been working for a construction company in Mosul when they were rounded up. ""We got to know that these people were moved from Mosul to Badush by their captors,"" Swaraj said. When India's junior foreign minister Vijay Kumar Singh and Iraqi government officials went to Badush, someone told them to inspect a mound in the village, the minister added. ""They said that they had buried many people there (in a mass grave). We reached there and requested Iraqi authorities to use a deep penetration radar, which detected many bodies under the surface,"" she told parliament. When the area was excavated, Indian officials found many identification marks such as non-Iraqi shoes and Sikh religious bangles. ""We felt these were our people... contacted a foundation working on the issue and shared missing workers' families' DNA samples with them for the identification process,"" the foreign minister told parliament. The Indian government had never received any ransom demand or any other direct communication from the kidnappers. A special plane will bring 38 of the 39 bodies home after formalities are completed in Iraq. The DNA matching process is still incomplete for the final victim. ""Howsoever painful, the families will get the dead bodies after over three years. This will hopefully bring some closure to the grieving families,"" Swaraj said. Some relatives, however, criticised the government. ""For the last four years the same minister has been telling me that we have traced their location and they're alive,"" Gurpinder Kaur, sister of one of the dead workers, told reporters in Punjab. ""I only heard what the minister said on television. I have no other information about it. I am waiting for her to contact me but I don't know what to trust,"" she added. Punjab state's chief minister Amarinder Singh described it as ""heart-wrenching news"". ""My heart goes out to the families who had been living in hope since their reported abduction by ISIS in 2014. Prayers with all of them,"" he said, using another acronym for the Islamic State. Shashi Tharoor, a lawmaker from the main opposition Congress party, told journalists the government had not done right by the families. ""If the government didn't have any details, why did they keep telling everyone they are alive? The government cheated the people (families) by giving them false hope for four years,"" he said. At a press conference later, Swaraj denied the government had given families false hope, insisting it had needed proof before confirming any deaths. The minister also could not say when the hostages had been killed."
13 BIFF gunmen slain in AFP offensive in Maguindanao,"COTABATO CITY–At least 13 Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) gunmen were killed in three days of military assault against the alleged Islamic State-linked group in Maguindanao since Monday. Nine BIFF members also yielded as the military continued to conduct air strikes and artillery fires, in addition to ground assaults in the towns of Shariff Saydona Mustapha, Datu Saudi Ampatuan, Datu Salibo, Mamasapano, and Shariff Aguak since April 9, said Capt. Arvin Encinas, spokesperson of the Army’s 6th Infantry Division. Encinas said two soldiers were injured in the clashes. They were checking if BIFF commanders Karialan, Bungos and Abu Toraife were among those killed, Encinas said. Maj. Gen. Arnel dela Vega, 6th ID commander, said 20 firearms were recovered in the operations while two BIFF camps had been captured. “Our troops utilized all available air assets, artillery as well as armor assets in support of the ground operations of the different field units,” dela Vega said. He said the operation against the BIFF would continue. Encinas said the surrender of the nine BIFF guerrillas was facilitated by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). He also confirmed that over 2,300 individuals had fled the clashes and were being assisted by various local government units."
Philippines says suspect Islamist militant recruiter arrested," MANILA, Feb 19 — Philippine security forces have arrested a foreigner suspected of recruiting domestic fighters for pro-Islamic State militant groups, including an alliance that occupied a southern city for five months last year, police said today. Director-General Ronald dela Rosa paraded before the media Fehmi Lassoued and his Filipino girlfriend, Anabel Salipada, three days after they were arrested in a rented apartment a few blocks away from the US embassy in Manila, the capital. “A thorough investigation is now underway to determine the extent of their involvement with international and domestic threat groups,” dela Rosa said, adding that an undisclosed foreign intelligence ally gave details of Lassoued’s identity and activities. Police also displayed handguns, ammunition and components for making improvised explosive devices and an Islamic State black flag, which were confiscated from Lassoued and Salipada. “Most likely, he is here with the intention to recruit ISIS sympathisers in Mindanao,” dela Rosa said, using another acronym for Islamic State. He said Lassoued has been travelling to Malaysia, the Philippines and Turkey in the last two years and first arrived in Manila in June 2016 on a Tunisian passport, which was found to be fake. Lassoued was born in the United Arab Emirates and is of Libyan and Tunisian descent but lived in Syria for many years, he added. The suspect may have helped recruit for the pro-Islamic State Maute group, which led a siege of southern Marawi City last year, he added. Appearing before a prosecutor, Lassoued denied the police allegations. He said he had fled Syria as Islamic State militants sought to establish a foothold there. "
 Paris attacks suspect silent as trial begins," BRUSSELS, Feb 5 — The prime surviving suspect in the 2015 Islamic State attacks on Paris went on trial in Brussels today, accused of the attempted murder of police shortly before his arrest in Belgium two years ago. Salah Abdeslam, 28, entered the court for his first public appearance since the attacks that killed 130 people in Paris in November 2015. In contrast to the time of his arrest four months later in his native Brussels, Belgian public broadcaster RTBF reported that he had long hair and a beard. Despite hopes in Paris that Abdeslam might break more than two years of silence on the carnage, RTBF said he told the court that he would not answer questions and refused to stand when the judge read out the charges against him.

"Hapilon's follower, Abu Sayyaf member nabbed in Zambo","ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines — A follower of slain Abu Sayyaf and Islamic State leader Isnilon Hapilon and another member were arrested separately by the police intelligence unit in this city, a police official said Saturday here. Chief Superintendent Billy Beltran, director of Police Regional Office 9, identified one of the suspects as Radulat Balito, a follower of Hapilon. Hapilon, who left Basilan and established ties with the Maute Group, was named as the emir of the IS for Southeast Asia. He was killed during the military offensive that liberated Marawi City in October last year. Beltran said the other arrested Abu Sayyaf member was Isah Sampal, also known as Sonny Abubakar. Balito was arrested on Friday about 7:50 a.m. by members of the Regional Intelligence Division unit under Superintendent Fergen Torred at Barangay Recodo, a west coast village this city. Sampal, on the other hand, was arrested about 7 a.m. Saturday by the same police intelligence unit at Barangay Mariki, a coastal village destroyed at the height of the 2013 siege. Beltran said both suspects were facing charges of kidnapping and serious illegal detention in connection with the mass abduction of plantation workers of Golden Harvest Inc. at Barangay Tairan, Lantawan on June 11, 2001. The two suspects were positively identified by witness, who are under the Witness Protection and Security Benefit Program of the Department of Justice. Based on the accounts of the witness, the two were among those who joined the Abu Sayyaf group who abducted around seven to 15 workers. Five victims were then executed. According to witnesses and kidnap victims, about 70 Abu Sayyaf group members were involved during the raid in the plantation. Read more at "

They were held on suspicion of plotting acts of violence and promoting ISIS ideology. One suspect, a 23-year-old Indonesian (far right), had allegedly scoured Kuala Lumpur in November, seeking Buddhist monks to kill, in retaliation for violence suffered by Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. He also allegedly planned attacks on police. The other, a Malaysian private religious school teacher, 25, was held in December on suspicion of planning an attack on entertainment outlets and to rob, kidnap or kill non-Muslims."
Seven militants who planned to attack places of worship arrested,"KUALA LUMPUR: Seven more suspected militants planning attacks in Malaysia, including at places of worship have been arrested in separate operations in Johor and Sabah. Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi Harun said in the first operation on Feb 27 conducted by the Counter Terrorism Police department, three suspects between 30 and 49 were arrested in Johor Baru. He said checks showed the three were planning to attack non-muslim prayer house and temples in the state. ""A 37 year old engineer at a private company, who was among the 3 arrested turned out to be the mastermind responsible for planning the attacks as well as for recruting new IS members. “Another suspect, a 49-year old who worked as a security guard was responsible to ensure that the recruits kept the secrecy of the group. ""He did this by threatening to kill anyone who leaked the information, "" he said. Fuzi said the third suspect was responsible for securing firearms and weapons by smuggling them from a neighbouring country. He said the third suspect had also gone to some of the non Muslim houses of worship in Johor to survey the locations and lay the ground work for the attacks. “The suspects had planned to flee to a neighbouring country after launching the attacks,” he said in a statement. Fuzi said police had conducted a follow up operation and arrested another three members of the same cell between Feb 28 and March 1. The fourth suspect picked up in a follow up operation was a 25 year old cafe waiter who received orders to kidnap and murder policemen who came in their way. “The orders were from the first and third suspects,"" he said. Fuzi said two more suspects - aged 22 and 23 who worked as cleaners in Singapore - were also arrested for allegedly playing middlemen roles in the arms deal. Meanwhile in an unrelated case in Sabah, Fuzi said 31-year-old right hand man of Furuji Indama (the head of the Abu Sayyaf militant group in Basilan, Southern Philippines) was arrested in a counter terrorism operation on Mar 15. ""The suspect had a very good and close relationship with Dr Mahmud Ahmad (A Malaysian militant who joined IS in the Phillipines). “He was also on the Phillipines government's wanted list for several kidnapping for ransom cases and attempted murders,” he said, adding the militant was an expert in making improvised explosive devices (IED). Fuzi said all those detained were being investigated for having links with terrorist groups and had been held under the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 (Sosma) and Section 574 of the Penal Code."
Italian priest kidnapped overnight near Niger's southern border,"NIAMEY: An Italian priest was kidnapped on Monday in south Niger, near the border with Burkina Faso, the second abduction of a European in the West African country this year. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the kidnapping, which was confirmed on Tuesday by the Nigerien and Italian governments. West African states have been struggling to gain the upper hand over jihadist groups, including some affiliated with al Qaeda and Islamic State, which are active along Niger's porous borders with both Mali and Burkina Faso. The kidnapping took place in the village of Bomanga, in the southern Makalondi district, about 125 km (80 miles) from the capital Niamey. In a statement on Tuesday, Niamey's Archbishop Laurent Lompo said Father Pier Luigi Maccalli was attacked and abducted by ""unidentified individuals"" on Monday evening. Maccalli had been working in Bomaga for 11 years as a member of the Society of African Missions (SMA), a Roman Catholic missionary organization. Italy's embassy in Niamey has called on the local authorities to resolve the matter as quickly as possible, the Italian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Western powers, primarily France but also the United States, have deployed thousands of troops in the semi-arid Sahel region to combat what they see as a growing Islamist militant threat that targets both civilians and the military. In April, a German humanitarian worker was abducted by men riding motorcycles near Niger's western border with Mali. Last October the Islamic State's affiliate in West Africa claimed responsibility for an attack in Niger's borderlands that killed four members of the U.S. special forces and at least four Nigerien soldiers. ""What is worrying us in particular is a bigger capacity of these terrorist groups to act, especially near the three borders,"" said a French diplomatic source, referring to Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso. France has some 4,500 troops in the area."
"Malaysian police arrest 8 terror suspects, including Abu Sayyaf members","KUALA LUMPUR: Eight terror suspects, including six members of the notorious kidnap-for-ransom Abu Sayyaf Group, were arrested in a series of raids recently, Malaysian police said on Friday (Nov 16).  The men were arrested in a sting operation conducted by the counter-terrorism division of the police's Special Branch between Oct 30 and Nov 12 in Sabah and Putrajaya, Inspector-General of Police Fuzi Harun said in a statement. One of the Filipino suspects was arrested in Ranau, Sabah. Police said he was recruiting children in the Philippines to be used as human shields. ""The 35-year-old suspect played the role of recruiting children to join Abu Sayyaf to be used as human shields during fighting with the Philippine military in Basilan,"" said Fuzi. ""He has also been involved in beheading hostages held by the Abu Sayyaf,"" he added. The man, who was working as a construction worker, was arrested in a sting operation that also netted another Filipino Abu Sayyaf suspect, aged 46, who was working as a technician. Both men are also involved in kidnap-for-ransom activities in Sabah and the southern Philippines. ""At the time of the arrests, both suspects were planning to escape to southern Philippines to avoid being arrested by Malaysian authorities,"" said Fuzi.  The arrests come in the wake of a Sep 11 kidnapping of two Indonesian fishermen in the waters off Sabah. Abu Sayyaf is notorious for kidnapping people for ransom and beheading its hostages when victims cannot pay up. The group ply the Sulu Seas and make bold incursions into the east coast of Sabah to snatch their victims. Another Abu Sayyaf member, aged 30,  was arrested in Kinarut, Sabah. He was a sub-commander and right-hand man of the group's commander Furuji Indama, said police. Another three Abu Sayyaf suspects, aged between 27 and 51 and who were working as labourers, were arrested in Tenom, Sabah. ""One of the suspects, aged 34, has expertise in producing firearms for the use of Abu Sayyaf,"" said Fuzi. Another Filipino man, 60, who worked as a petty trader in a night market, was arrested for his involvement in protecting one of the suspects who was arrested on Nov 8 as he was trying to run away from a police dragnet. In addition, a 38-year-old Malaysian man, who worked as an agent selling gold bars, was arrested in Putrajaya for channelling funds to a Malaysian Islamic State member Akel Zainal in Syria in 2017 to fund terror activities."
Kidnappers expected to strike again in Sabah as militants seek funds for terror activities,"SANDAKAN, Sabah: A sense of unease has overcome parts of the east Malaysian state of Sabah on Borneo island after a kidnapping incident off the waters of the coastal town of Semporna last week (Sep 11). Masked men armed with M16s, allegedly linked to the notorious kidnap-for-ransom Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) based in southern Philippines’ Mindanao island, snatched two Indonesian men from a fishing vessel.  It was the first such incident Sabah has seen in almost two years. Now there are concerns that they could strike again in a bid to raise funds for terror activities in the southern Philippines. That warning comes from an intelligence official and a former militant. A combination of Islamic State’s (IS) call to arms in Mindanao and the Philippine military’s operations against militants are pushing ASG to seek funds through kidnapping. Likewise, poverty in southern Philippines makes for easy recruits by militants and kidnapping gangs. “This incident (kidnapping) is something that is difficult to stop. However, it (situation) is under control,” Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay, head of Special Branch counter-terrorism division, told Channel NewsAsia. Special Branch is the intelligence arm of the Royal Malaysian Police and the lead agency in counter-terrorism operations. “The kidnappings are still occurring because these groups (ASG) are pressured to seek funds to continue with their (militant) activities as Filipino authorities are conducting clearance operations against militants,” Ayob added. According to Eastern Sabah Security Command (Esscom) chief Hazani Ghazali, events in Philippines have a significant impact on Sabah. “Whatever happens in Philippines will impact on Sabah.  Sabah is a very important border for the whole of Malaysia and the Sulu sea,” said Hazani. “ASG and pro-Islamic State groups (in southern Philippines) need money for their daily needs, mobilisation from one place to another, procurement of communication equipment and weapons,” Abdullah Sandakan, a former member of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) militant group that has ties with Abu Sayyaf, told Channel NewsAsia. “The recent kidnapping … to get money to fund small acts of terrorism ... moving in the direction for something similar like Marawi,” said Abdullah. Pro-Islamic State militants, including a faction of ASG, seized control of Marawi in May 2017 and laid siege to the city for five months. More than 1,000 were killed in the fighting. It was Islamic State’s most serious assault to gain a foothold into Southeast Asia, unsettling governments across the region. Prior to Marawi’s siege, Sabah and the surrounding Sulu Sea experienced a spike in kidnappings, jumping to 10 incidents in 2016 versus one incident in 2015. According to Abdullah, the 2016 kidnappings were to raise funds for the battle in Marawi. “You see how many kidnappings took place prior to the Marawi siege? It was to raise funds for Marawi. Kidnapping was the easiest way as you get cash,” said Abdullah. “Yes, those kidnappings (2016) were for Marawi,” Hazani told Channel NewsAsia. The latest kidnapping is the first in almost two years as joint maritime patrol launched in 2017 by Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines at the Sulu Sea helped to reduce incidents of piracy and kidnappings. As IS loses its territories in Syria and Iraq, it has called on its followers to go to Mindanao island to fight, saying it is the new “land of jihad"". Moreover, Turkey and other countries have tightened up their borders with Syria. “This in turn has diverted militants to southern Philippines who is also pro-IS,” said Ayob Khan. Since 2013, 41 militants were nabbed for attempting to enter into Mindanao through Sabah. Of that number, 27 were foreigners who were mainly Indonesians. Sabah is an important jumping off point for Malaysians and foreign fighters wishing to wage jihad in Mindanao given its close proximity to southern Philippines. According to former JI member Abdullah, foreign fighters enter Sabah through the east coast towns of Lahad Datu, Tawau, Kunak and Semporna. Abdullah said he knows this route well - he used to smuggle foreign fighters from Indonesia through the same route. But increased operations from Esscom has led militants to use a new route on the west coast of Sabah. “They (foreign fighters) are now starting to use Indonesia’s Kalimantan-Keningau route on the West coast to enter Sabah to avoid increased operations on the east coast,” said Esscom chief Hazani. Similiarly, Sabah is also a gateway for ASG members and other foreign fighters to escape from Philippine military operations to travel all the way to Peninsular Malaysia. “From Semenanjung (Peninsular), they can fly to anywhere in the world via Kuala Lumpur airport.,” said Esscom’s Hazani. Since 2013, a total of 27 Abu Sayyaf members have been arrested by police in Malaysia. “They (ASG) come to Malaysia to hide ... they are usually wanted in the Phillppines. There are some of them who come here to get away from their past life with ASG. However, they will still give their support to ASG,” said Ayob. Once in Kuala Lumpur, ASG members were reported to be working as security guards, labourers and members of a paramilitary civilian volunteer corp known as RELA. “A total of seven ASG members were arrested while working as security guards,” said Ayob. ASG also tried to recruit new members in Malaysia to join them in southern Philippines, he added. Last year, Malaysian police foiled a plan by ASG to attack the closing ceremony of the Southeast Asian Games in Kuala Lumpur. NO END IN SIGHT TO PRO-IS GROUPS FIGHTING IN MINDANAO “Their (IS) movement will continue with no end in sight as the death of one leader, meaning Isnilon Hapilon, will be replaced by another,” said ex-JI member Abdullah. ASG also has access to weapons which they buy from the black market. “ASG gets most of their weapons from the black market. They also have their own arms-producing factory,” said Andrin Raj, Southeast Asia regional director, of International Association for Counter terrorism and Security Professionals (IACSP). JI’s Abdullah also warned that pro-IS groups’ fighting capacity in southern Philippines was becoming more strategic and “integrated” as foreign fighters trained in urban warfare were converging there. “This is a solid convergence of warfare – you have foreign fighters trained in urban warfare that fought in Syria combined with ASG that knows jungle warfare,” said Abdullah."
 Philippines says eight jihadists killed in the south,"MANILA, March 9 — The Philippine military said today it had killed at least eight Islamic militants in an operation to stop jihadist efforts to set up base in the country’s south following the deadly five-month siege of Marawi city last year. Armoured vehicles and artillery were used against about 50 gunmen from the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) on Mindanao island yesterday, local military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Gerry Bisana said in a report. The military said last month that gunmen linked to the Islamic State group have renewed an armed campaign to set up a caliphate in the region, home to the Catholic nation’s Muslim minority. A first attempt was put down last year after a US-backed military campaign that flattened Marawi and left more than 1,100 people dead. Survivors of the Marawi siege have recruited a fresh force of about 200 gunmen, according to the military, with President Rodrigo Duterte warning they could attack other Mindanao cities. Bisana said troops recovered the bodies of eight gunmen, although they believe the militants carried off 15 other dead comrades. He added that a soldier was also wounded in the fighting near the town of Datu Saudi Ampatuan. “Soldiers have been vigilantly guarding the entire central Mindanao in order to constrict the firefight in specific... areas, and continue to pursue the remnants of the terror group,” regional military chief Major-General Arnel dela Vega said. The BIFF is a splinter group of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the country’s largest Muslim guerrilla force that signed a peace treaty with Manila in 2014 after a decades-long armed campaign that claimed more than 100,000 lives by official estimates. The MILF has echoed Duterte’s warnings in recent months, as the two sides pushed to get Congress to pass a Muslim self-rule law that both said would help roll back jihadist gains in Mindanao."
Tillerson says US Mideast peace plan 'fairly well advanced',"AMMAN, Feb 14 — The United States’s work on a new Middle East peace plan is “fairly well advanced”, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said today, though he provided no details on an initiative which comes amid deep Palestinian scepticism about US intentions. Tillerson, who was speaking during a visit to Jordan to sign a five-year US$6.4 billion (RM25.09 billion) aid package that extends US support to a key Arab ally, said President Donald Trump would decide when to announce the peace plan. The United States infuriated even its Arab allies in December when Trump recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and initiated the move of the US embassy from Tel Aviv. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he would not cooperate with the United States in its efforts as a mediator. “I have seen the (administration’s peace) plan... It’s been under development for a number of months. I have consulted with them on the plan, identified areas that we feel need further work. I will say it’s fairly well advanced...” Tillerson said. There has been little detail on the plan so far. Officials told Reuters in December it would deal with all major issues, including Jerusalem, borders, security, the future of Jewish settlements on occupied land and the fate of Palestinian refugees, and would also urge Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states to provide significant financial support to the Palestinians. The plan is being crafted by a team led by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, and US Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt, both of whom have travelled to key regional capitals since the Trump administration came to office. Palestinians have grown increasingly concerned that any plan Trump unveils will shortchange them, a fear exacerbated by his move on Jerusalem, which upended decades of US policy that the status of the ancient city must be decided in negotiations. Jerusalem is home to sites holy to Muslims, Jews and Christians. Jordanian King Abdullah’s Hashemite dynasty is the custodian of the Muslim holy sites, making Amman particularly sensitive to any changes of status there. The king has warned that Trump’s decision could undermine stability and fuel radicalism. Jordanian foreign minister Ayman al-Safadi reiterated on Wednesday that a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was the “only solution we believe can work”. The Trump administration has said it would back a two-state solution if the parties agreed to it. Trump had threatened to cut off financial aid to countries that backed a UN resolution calling for Washington to reverse its Jerusalem decision. Jordan backed the resolution. But the Trump administration has courted King Abdullah, a moderate pro-Western Arab leader whose kingdom has long upheld US interests in a turbulent region. On Wednesday Tillerson met the king at his personal residence where the two emphasised strong US-Jordanian ties. Commenting on the memorandum of understanding signed for US$6.375 billion in aid on Wednesday, the US State Department said: “(It) highlights the pivotal role Jordan plays in helping foster and safeguard regional stability and supports US objectives such as the global campaign to defeat ISIS, counter-terrorism cooperation, and economic development.” ISIS is an acronym for the militant Islamic State group. Conflicts in neighbouring Syria and Iraq have damaged Jordan’s economy, forcing it to borrow heavily from external and domestic sources. Jordan has been an important part of the US-led coalition battling Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Tillerson is also expected this week to visit Turkey, with which US ties have become badly strained over Washington’s support for the Kurdish YPG militia in Syria, regarded by Ankara as a terrorist group. Tillerson said Washington had to “find a way to continue to work in the same direction”. He also expressed concern over Saturday’s confrontation between Israel and “Iranian assets” in Syria. Syrian air defences shot down an Israeli F-16 jet after it bombed a site used by Iran-backed forces in Syria. Tillerson said Iran should withdraw its forces and militias from Syria, where Tehran backs President Bashar al-Assad. Responding to the comments, a senior Iranian official, Ali Akbar Velayati, said Iran’s military presence in Syria was legitimate and based on an invitation from Damascus. He called on US forces to leave Syria."
Troops capture Abu Sayyaf subleader after firefight in Sulu," ZAMBOANGA CITY – The military on Sunday said an Abu Sayyaf subleader who was wounded during a recent firefight was captured during another clash in Patikul, Sulu on Saturday. At the same time, the military denied a claim by the Islamic State that three soldiers were killed in Saturday’s firefight in Patikul. Brig. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, the commander of Joint Task Force Sulu, said soldiers under the 32nd Infantry Battalion were conducting a search-and-rescue operation for Abu Sayyaf kidnap victims when informed that Walton Juljirin and four of his men were hiding in Sitio Kan Bading in Barangay Taung. Sobejana said the soldiers went to check the reported hiding place of Juljirin and his men and clashed with the bandits. He said Juljirin’s four men fled during the five minute firefight but left behind the Abu Sayyaf subleader, who had difficulty moving because of an infected wound. “Our soldiers eventually captured Walton Juljirin, the ASG subleader during the clearing operation,” Sobejana said. Lt. Col. Ronaldo Mateo, the 32nd IB commander, said none of his men was harmed during the clash. Mateo said also recovered were a 7.62-mm FN-G1 rifle, some magazines and ammunition, suspected improvised explosive devices, and two hand grenades. He said the captured subleader was immediately given medical attention before being brought to the headquarters of the 501st Brigade in Barangay Tagbak in Indanan town. “The group of Walton Juljirin is under the group of ASG sub-leader Mundi Sawadjaan (a nephew of ASG leader Hajan Sawadjaan). His group was responsible in the series of IED and roadside bombings along the highway of Patikul, Sulu. Also, Juljirin’s group is the liquidation squad of Sawadjaan’s group,” said Lt. Gen. Carlito Galvez, Jr., the commander of the Western Mindanao Command. Galvez said Juljirin was the 14thAbu Sayyaf member captured since Jan. 1 this year. “With the capture of Juljirin, we are optimistic that we will gain more grounds and soon defeat the Abu Sayyaf here in the island province,” Galvez added. He said since January up to end-March, 11 bandits had already been killed in military operations in Sulu while 60 others had surrendered. “Our priority is to find and rescue the remaining kidnap victims who are still in Sulu area. We are currently doubling our efforts towards that goal,” Galvez added. "
Two Indonesian fishermen kidnapped in Malaysia`s Semporna waters,"Kota Kinabalu, (ANTARA News) - A group of armed people reportedly abducted two Indonesian fishermen working on a local fishing vessel in Semporna waters in the Malaysian state of Sabah early Tuesday. The local media reported that the group of people, armed with M-16 rifles, ascended the fishing boat and abducted two crew members at around 1 a.m. local time. Two other crew members survived the abduction attempt, as they hid in one of the fishing boat`s compartments. They later reported the incident to the police in Semporna. Both the police and the Eastern Sabah Security Command (ESSCOM) confirmed the abduction, which is the first of its kind in the past two years. Spokesman for Sabah Police Omar Mammah confirmed the abduction, saying that the police are still investigating the motive behind the abduction. ""At around midnight, two people, armed with M-16 rifles, abducted (two fishermen) in the waters of Gaya Island,"" he stated. He noted that the two fishermen were sailing on a boat when the armed group kidnapped them and then took them to an unknown location. ""We believe the abduction case has to do with a kidnap-for-ransom (KFR) group. However, we have yet to receive any request from any party for ransom,"" he remarked. An official of the Indonesian Embassy in Kuala Lumpur confirmed the abduction."
"ASEAN, Australia forge historic anti-terror pact","THE Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Australia on Saturday sealed a historic agreement seeking to bolster regional security, with the joint signing of the memorandum of understanding on a Cooperation to Counter International Terrorism on the sidelines of the Asean-Australia Special Summit. Leading the Philippine government delegation was Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano, who represents President Rodrigo Duterte for the two-day leaders’ dialogue in Sydney. The MOU is aimed at strengthening the cooperation between the two parties in combating terrorism, counter-terrorism financing, and in the fight against violent extremism. In a joint statement, the leaders stressed that the crafting of the MOU demonstrates their “joint resolve to stand together” against those who seek to divide communities. The document intensifies Australia’s annual engagement with the bloc and enshrines practical measures to deepen dialogue across governments and security and law enforcement institutions. The MOU is supported by programs on technical and regulatory assistance to develop best practices in aid of counter-terrorism legislation, and regional dialogues and workshops on topics, such as electronic evidence, financial intelligence, and countering online radicalization. “Asean nations have a strong record of working together to confront violent extremism and defeat terrorist organizations,” the joint statement read. “In recent years the threat posed  by returning foreign fighters and ISIL-linked extremists has grown. It makes today’s cooperation all the more important,” it added. The MOU signing adds to the numerous peace and security cooperation between the two parties, which ranges from cyber and maritime cooperation, in their fight against people trafficking.  In related developments: • Australia on Saturday warned the use of encrypted messaging apps to plan terrorist attacks was the greatest threat faced by intelligence agencies in modern times and urged a “united and cohesive” response. Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton told an Asean-Australia special summit in Sydney that the use of the “dark web” by extremists and other criminals was a spiraling problem. “The use of encrypted messaging apps by terrorists and criminals is potentially the most significant degradation of intelligence capability in modern times,” he said. Dutton added at the meeting of Southeast Asian leaders that the only way to deal with the threat, and the increasing use of the Internet by groups like Islamic State to radicalize and recruit new members, was together. “While our nations are focused on countering the ongoing threat of terrorism domestically, it would be a mistake to approach the problem from a purely national perspective,” he said. “Terrorism and violent extremism transcend national borders.  “Countering the threat requires a united and cohesive regional effort involving coordination between our respective national security and law enforcement agencies.” Canberra is already helping Southeast Asian states choke terrorist financing and counter violent extremism.• Provocative images of one-time human rights icon Aung San Suu Kyi with a Hitler moustache and banners demanding Cambodia’s Hun Sen step down were held by protesters in Sydney in a rally against Southeast Asian leaders. Thousands demonstrated in the city against a raft of grievances on the sidelines of an Australia-Asean special summit, where Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has vowed to tackle human rights issues. They came together to urge the release of political prisoners in Vietnam, an end to strongman Hun Sen’s regime in Cambodia and a halt to the military crackdown on Rohingya in Myanmar. “We are here to protest issues that are happening in Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, the Rohingya—you name it, we are here to send a clear voice to these governments that you do not mistreat human rights,” Vietnamese-Australian protestor Davy Nguyen told AFP. Leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations including Hun Sen, Myanmar’s de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi and Vietnam’s Nguyen Xuan Phuc, are in Sydney for talks. The Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte opted not to attend. All have been accused of oppression. “The summit is here, and the [Australian] government needs to do something—they need to put human rights before economics, before money,” Nguyen added. Among banners was one portraying Aung San Suu Kyi with a Adolf Hitler moustache, calling on her to “Return the Nobel Prize.” The terrorist problem has been exacerbated by jihadists now being forced out of Syria and Iraq with the Islamic State caliphate mostly crushed. The issue was driven home last year when pro-Islamic State militants seized the southern Philippine city of Marawi, with Australia aiding Manila to win it back. A memorandum of understanding will be issued at the summit later Saturday, reportedly with an agreement to pool cyber intelligence and police resources across the region for the first time. The Australian newspaper said it would include a regional digital forensics task force and uniform criminal legislative frameworks to secure prosecutions. Australia has suffered six terror attacks in recent years and disrupted 14 more, including a plot to bring down a plane departing Sydney. In response, Canberra has consolidated key functions like national security, immigration, counter-terrorism, cyber-security, and border protection under a newly-created Home Affairs department, headed by Dutton. He said that to address the issue of apps which allow extremists to operate clandestinely, Canberra planned to introduce legislation to strengthen agencies’ ability to adapt to encryption. This will include making companies that provide communications services and devices obliged to assist when asked, while also making the use of surveillance devices and computer network exploitation by authorities easier. Asean groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, with Australia a dialogue partner since 1974."
Root causes of extremism must be resolved to win the fight against terrorism,"PUTRAJAYA: The reluctance to recognise the root causes of extremist ideology can be attributed to the slow progress in countering terrorism efforts. Former Institute of Strategic and International Studies (ISIS) chairman and chief executive officer Tan Sri Mohamed Jawhar Hassan said the reluctance had impeded progress to counter the spread of terrorism. ""The root causes are skirted for fear they may become unpleasant to talk about. But unless the root causes are addressed it would be difficult to neutralise in any sustainable manner the threats that the terrorist organisations pose. ""The Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the US bases in Muslim land and corrupt Muslim regimes were the root factors that bred and drove Al-Qaeda. It declared a holy war against the United States, and militants linked to it launched the Sept 11, 2001 attacks. ""IS (Islamic State) was bred in the anarchic conditions that followed the US illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003. It drew much of its recruits and arms from the defeated Iraqi armed forces. ""It has evolved since to draw support and recruits from Muslims in many parts of the world. Outside the conflict zones, the largest number come from European countries in particularly Belgium,"" he said at the Putrajaya International Security Dialogue 2018. Jawhar said the various violent conflicts in West Asia where foreign powers were also involved continued to draw Muslim fighters in the region and from abroad. He shared the findings of the International Centre for the Study of Violent Extremism director Dr Anne Speckhard, who had interviewed nearly 500 terrorists, their families and close associates in nine countries and Western Europe. He said, Speckhard discovered that those resided in conflict zones were most often primarily motivated by trauma and revenge as well as frustrated aspiration. In Europe, Jawhar said, Speckhard's research showed that ""marginalisation"", ""discrimination"", ""unemployment"", ""underemployment"", ""frustrated aspirations"" and ""anger over geopolitics"" were among the significant motivations depending upon the country and the context. The second fundamental factor that had impeded progress in the global counter-terrorism drive was actions that continue to be taken by big powers that further aggravated the environment which bred terrorism and extremism. ""If there is a watershed event that triggered the rise of Muslim militant and terrorist movements it is the expulsion of the Palestinian population from their land following the establishment of Israel in 1948. ""Before 1948, there were hardly any terrorist organisations composed of Muslims. ""Neither did they dominate the terrorism landscape in the manner they do present,"" he said. The recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on Dec 7 had outraged not only Muslims but most of the world, said Jawhar. He added these actions had further fuelled Arab, Iranian and Muslim anger and aggravated the ecosystem in which terrorism and extremism thrived. On counter-terrorism strategy, Jawhar said it had to be enhanced substantially if the scourge of terrorism among Muslims and to the rest of the world was to be neutralised effectively and sustainably. ""The existing hard and soft security measures are of critical importance. ""However, they require to be situated within a more comprehensive and holistic approach that seeks to foster an environment of which terrorism will have no appeal and becomes irrelevant,"" he said. West Asia, he added, had to be transformed from a region of sustained turmoil to a region of sustainable peace."
PH joins global alliance to beat IS – US Secretary of State,"The Philippines has joined a United States-led broad international coalition that seeks to crush terror organization Islamic State (IS), Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson announced on Tuesday in Kuwait. “We were able to announce today it’s now 75 members because we welcomed the Philippines,” Tillerson said in a joint press briefing with the Kuwaiti foreign minister, which transcript was made available at state.gov. The US-led Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS was formed in 2014. Kuwait played host to the meeting of the anti-ISIS coalition and announced a donation of $330 million to help fund Iraq’s reconstruction. “As ISIS has evolved, so has the coalition. The guiding principles that were adopted by the coalition today lay out our vision for the future role of the coalition to continue this fight against ISIS,” Tillerson said. According to Tillerson, the coalition was committed to “destroying ISIS wherever it may be, denying its ability to recruit, move foreign terrorist fighters, transfer funds, and spread their false propaganda across the internet and other social media vehicles.” The Philippine government has yet to announce its participation in the coalition. In May 2017, the ISIS-inspired Maute group besieged Marawi City in the Southern Philippines. This prompted President Rodrigo Duterte to declare martial law across the Mindanao region. The battle between the Maute group and government troops lasted for nearly five months, which resulted in the displacement of thousands of civilians and left Marawi City in ruins. The militants were defeated and failed to establish an ISIS territory or wilayat in Mindanao. During the so-called Marawi City siege, the US extended its support to the Philippines by providing counter-terror weapons to Philippine soldiers. The US also pledged aid in the rehabilitation of the war-torn city."
 China walks a tightrope on the Uighur Muslim issue: Daily Star columnist,"DHAKA (THE DAILY STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - China has never been at ease with its religious minorities-be they Buddhists, Muslims, Christians or those practicing the religio-philosophical traditions of Confucianism and Taoism. China's Communist Party has directed its nearly 90 million members to shun religion for maintaining party unity. It warns that religious belief is a ""redline"" for the cadres and those who refuse to comply would be punished. Religion in China is seen as a hindrance to human development. However, though China's constitution theoretically allows religious belief, China is actually an atheist state and has promoted atheism throughout the country. Consequently, adherents across all religious organisations-whether state-sanctioned or banned/underground-face intensified persecution and repression. The trouble is, over the past decades, religious observance has been on the rise in China. According to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) 2013 Universal Periodic Review, the number of registered religious believers in China is around 100 million, though the actual number will be much higher. Amid rapid modernisation and economic progress, the number of religious believers who yearn to fill their spiritual vacuum has grown. Though persecution against the Uighur Muslims has been going on for some years, the actual picture has now emerged. Uighurs are a Turkic-speaking Muslim ethnic minority numbering nearly 10 million (45 per cent) in a population of 22.1 million in China's largest autonomous province of Xinjiang. They consider themselves culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. Xinjiang is bordered by eight countries including the former Soviet Central Asian republics, Mongolia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. Economic development of the resource-rich region has seen large-scale immigration of the Han Chinese to the region. Han Chinese account for 90 per cent of China's total population but is a minority (37 per cent) in Xinjiang. Uighurs complain of discrimination and marginalisation by the Chinese authorities. There are also complaints that Han Chinese who get the best jobs are not sharing the profits of the region's economic boom. This has led to tensions between the Uighur Muslims and the Han Chinese. Anti-Han resentment has been on the rise since the 1990s and led to serious rioting, knife attacks and suicide bombings on many occasions. Added to this was the surge in nationalist sentiments amongst the Uighur Muslims. If the Central Asian countries can gain independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union, why can't the autonomous Xinjiang be also independent? In early August 2018, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination reviewed reports of discrimination against Uighurs in Xinjiang. The UN said it is alarmed by reports of mass detention of Uighurs. The UN body released its concluding observations on August 30, 2018, criticising the ""broad definition of terrorism and vague references to extremism and unclear definition of separatism in Chinese legislation."" The Committee report said that Beijing has ""turned the Uighur administrative region into something that resembles a massive internment camp."" More than one million Uighurs are in ""re-education camps""-actually detention camps, according to the Committee. Most inmates have never been charged with a crime but they do not receive any legal representation. Beijing initially denied the existence of such camps but later admitted that some religious extremists were being held for ""re-education"". Beijing says it wants to promote ""harmonious unity"" between Uighurs and the Han Chinese. A large number of Chinese troops are currently stationed in Xinjiang to control the situation. The Committee called upon Beijing to: i) end the practice of detention without lawful charge, trial and conviction; ii) immediately release individuals currently detained under these circumstances; iii) provide the number of people held as well as the grounds for their detention; and iv) conduct an impartial investigation of racial, ethnic and ethno-religious profiling. Clearly, China has been in violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch reports claimed mass imprisonment of Uighur Muslims in camps where inmates are forced to swear loyalty to China's President Xi Jinping and to shout Communist Party slogans. The inmates are poorly fed and reports of torture are widespread with some dying. Some of the oppressive measures imposed include: Uighur children are not allowed in mosques; male Uighurs cannot have beards or wear caps (except for the very old); no veils for women. There are strict restrictions on their movement. In 2014, Beijing also banned Uighurs from fasting during the month of Ramadan. For Beijing, every Uighur is a potential terror suspect. In another development in early August 2018, hundreds of Muslim worshippers in north-western Ningxia region refused to back down when the authorities tried to demolish the Weizhou Grand Mosque on grounds that it was not built with proper permits. Though law enforcers have temporarily left the area, tension continues to run high among the Ningxia Muslims. Beijing's repressive measures on the Uighurs are actually feeding terrorism, according to critics. Suppression of Uighurs has driven many activists underground. Beijing is jittery about the independent way of life, the Turkic language and religious practices of the Uighurs-but more so because of the influence of neighbouring Muslim states. Some Uighurs are said to have fought with ISIL in Syria and have now returned to Xinxiang. Beijing has also recently promulgated a law that prohibits religious preaching on Internet and live-streaming of prayers and worshipping. Beijing justifies its repression on the Muslim population on the lame excuse that China faces serious threats from Islamist militants. But Beijing's policies towards the Buddhists of Tibet and the Christian community are equally questionable. The Chinese Communist Party has not yet been able to reconcile and accept the concepts of human rights and religious freedom. There is a possibility that persecution and repression by the Chinese government on Muslims may lead the younger Uighur generation towards organised resistance and violence.

Strengthen US security through development in PH,"The United States should seize the opportunity to transform its recent military success, assisting the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) in the island of Mindanao, into a durable peace using adaptive measures that focus on key factors for improving human development. Because of the significant geopolitical interests of the United States in this region, it must remain engaged with the government of the Philippines in balancing military and development strategy to bolster the Philippines. The foreign policy of the United States government has previously failed to remedy the fundamental drivers of internal armed struggles in the Philippines, leading to a history of recurring insurgencies. The US State Department, in conjunction with the President and the Security Council, must integrate military success with development initiatives targeting key drivers of armed conflict, to achieve enduring peace. The United States has two critical interests in fortifying its ally, the Philippines. First, the growing influence of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in this region has been enabled by the presence of weaker nations, such as the Philippines. The PRC seized the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, situated between Vietnam and the Philippines, and claimed by both countries. The PRC secured them by building an air base on that territory. The PRC has similar designs for Scarborough Shoals, claimed by the Philippines, and which lie 300 miles from Luzon. However, the PRC does not recognize the tribunal formed to resolve such maritime disputes under the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, placing pressure on all nations who depend on the shipping lanes of the South China Sea through which five trillion dollars’ worth of trade passed in 2016. The South China Sea also harbors seven billion barrels of proven oil reserves and 900 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, enough to reduce dependency of the Philippines on imported oil and domestic coal that provides 45.8 percent of its electricity Second, the domestic security of the United States and its overseas interests depend on defeating State Department-designated foreign terror organizations (FTO) and their allies who pose a transnational threat to the homeland. The impact of terror organizations extends across borders. Abu Sayyaf (ASG) evolved in Mindanao in 1990, partly composed of former Mujahideen fighters returningfrom Afghanistan to the Philippines. Saudi Arabia and Pakistan financed al-Islamic Tabligh, a Filipino charity that educated the founder of ASG in the 1980s. Jeemah Islamiya, an FTO in Malaysia affiliated with al-Qaeda, has given technical support to the insurgent Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) of Mindanao. MILF has claimed a following of over 200,000 in western Mindanao. The Maute Group, a paramilitary gang from the province of Lanao del Sur in Mindanao, swore allegiance to the Islamic State (ISIL) in 2015. The US military has responded by providing technical support to the AFP which defeated both ASG and the Mautes at Marawi in October, 2017, and killed their leaders. The principal drivers of insurgency in the Philippines include injustice, endemic corruption, social marginalization, poverty, and food insecurity. The Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines documented 1,474 extrajudicial disappearances and executions linked to current President Duterte during his tenure as mayor of Davao City. A campaign against illegal street drugs of the current administration has resulted in the documented killing of more than 5,000 prior to arraignment. Current social discrimination against the poorest segments of society has led to further internal conflict. Tensions between communities of the poor and the government have grown. Filipinos perceive that the poor population have become the main targets of President Duterte’s campaign against illegal drugs. According to a Social Weather Stations report dated October, 28, 2017, 54 percent of Filipinos agree that rich drug users are not killed, and only the poor ones are punished in this way. Social and political marginalization not only impacts the poorest Filipinos, but also a group of indigenous people known as the Lumads in the eastern provinces of the island. According to CNN Philippines, in a press conference on July 25, 2017, the Philippine President publicly threatened to bomb Lumad schools, unless the Lumads stop teaching what the President considers socialist philosophy and rebellion. Nationwide economic disparities affect all of the Philippines, not just Mindanao. As a result, the United States must aid the government of the Philippines in implementing large scale development efforts that benefit the poorest Filipinos. Nine percent of the population of the Philippines live as informal settlers or squatters according to the Philippine Statistics Authority in 2015. A survey by Social Weather Stations as of January 16, 2018 found 15.9 percent of families suffer hunger, while 32 percent feel food poor. The World Bank estimates that remittances account for 9 percent of Gross Domestic Product, because Filipinos go abroad to earn a living to support families. The World Bank calculates a current Gini of 45 for the Philippines, evincing wide disparities in wealth. The government of the Philippines initiated a conditional cash transfer program, Pantawid Pamilya Pilipino Program , in 2007 to boost food security among young children. Yet, this initiative needs external support for the government of the Philippines to expand it. The United States must equalize success in security operations with development initiatives to defuse the drivers of insurgency. Governance reform and initiatives to build human capital are especially needed. The State Department could give incentives to the government of the Philippines to cooperate with US aid agencies, USAID and Civil Affairs for the Defense Department, to eliminate the drivers of insurgent armed conflict. The United States should match military success with development initiatives in the Philippines to strengthen US global security. Building the human capital of the Philippines through the coordinated development efforts of both governments will strengthen its core economy and social stability. The governments of the United States and the Philippines must combine military success overcoming armed insurgency in Marawi with a focus on development strategy to alleviate key drivers of insurgency by settling longstanding insurgent grievances in Mindanao. Durable domestic peace in the Philippines will augment US regional security in the Philippines and the South China Sea.

Syria rebels think jihadists will quit Idlib buffer zone,"AMMAN: Syrian rebels said on Thursday they have growing confidence that their jihadist rivals will comply with a requirement to leave a demilitarized buffer zone set up by Turkey and Russia to avert a Russian-backed Syrian army offensive. Last week Turkey and Russia agreed to enforce a new demilitarized zone in Idlib province from which ""radical"" rebels will be required to withdraw by the middle of next month. The position of the biggest jihadist group, Tahrir al-Sham, spearheaded by al Qaeda's former Syrian offshoot, will be crucial to the deal's success, but it has so far said nothing. Several rebel sources said neither jihadist nor mainstream rebels had started to pull back yet. However, a senior Syrian opposition official said Tahrir al-Sham had sent secret feelers to the Turkish army though third parties in recent days signaling it would comply. ""Matters are moving well and Tahrir al-Sham has pledged it is going to implement but without announcing its agreement,"" said the opposition official, who was briefed by Turkish officials and requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. The demilitarized zone will be 15 to 20 km (10 to 12 miles) deep, run along the contact line between rebel and government fighters, and will be patrolled by Turkish and Russian forces. The agreement could unravel quickly if they cannot impose their plan on the jihadists. Another senior opposition figure said he expected Tahrir al-Sham to implement the deal and dismissed risks of a showdown because the agreement did not seek to force jihadist fighters to hand over their weapons. ""I foresee it will be implemented within the time set,"" said Ahmed Toma, a prominent opposition figure who headed the Syrian rebel delegation in Russian-sponsored talks in the Kazakh capital. Turkey sought to avert the Syrian army's Idlib offensive, fearing a new exodus of refugees as the U.N. warned of a humanitarian catastrophe. Ankara pledged to Moscow it would handle the jihadist threat. A regional intelligence source said the jihadists were softening their stance to avoid internecine fighting with mainstream rebels that could wreck the deal and allow the stalled offensive to resume. ""I don't expect any hurdles in implementation from all the revolutionary forces at all,"" said Abdul Salam Abdul Razzak, a leading figure in the National Front for Liberation, the alliance of Turkey-allied Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebel groups. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview with Reuters late on Tuesday that the withdrawal of ""radical groups"" had already started. Another senior rebel source said months of covert Turkish intelligence efforts were focusing on separating a minority of foreign jihadists within Tahrir al-Sham from a majority of its Syrian followers, who could eventually be rehabilitated. Precision strikes would help to handle foreign jihadists, whose presence has often been cited by the Syrian army and Russia as the reason for an assault on Idlib as a ""terrorist nest"", the source said. The National Front for Liberation, which had declared its ""complete cooperation"" with the Turkish effort, said it foresaw a smooth operation once logistical preparations with Turkey were concluded. ""Pulling heavy arms from the frontline is not a difficult matter as most of these weapons are deployed away from the frontline,"" Abdul Razzak said, adding the group's only concern was whether the Syrian army and its allies would abide by the deal."
US blacklists Pinoy ISIS member,"Washington—Three Southeast Asians who appeared in a 2016 Islamic State video showing the beheading of a captive were added to the US Treasury’s sanctions blacklist Friday. The Treasury said Malaysian Mohamad Rafi Udin, Indonesian Mohammed Karim Yusop Faiz and Filipino Mohammad Reza Lahaman Kiram all took part in the June 2016 video made in Syria in which Islamic State members executed a prisoner. Sigal Mandelker, Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said the video was “part of a propaganda campaign to attract radicals to join militant terrorist groups in Southeast Asia.” Udin, 52, is a well-known Malaysian militant, having been detained in 2003-2006 for his association with the radical Islamist group Jemaah Islamiyah. As of last November, he was believed to be the senior most Malaysian in the Islamic State in Syria, the Treasury said.Faiz, 49, was imprisoned in the Philippines for nine years on explosives and weapons charges.  After being released, he traveled to Syria in 2014 and joined Islamic State. Kiram, 28, is believed to be responsible for bombing a bus in Zamboanga, Philippines in 2012.  He was still in Syria fighting for Islamic State as of January 2017, the Treasury said."
How new antiterrorism law will change Indonesia's war on terror,"Indonesia will soon have a new antiterrorism law to replace the current law, which is widely seen as weak, with deliberations on the antiterrorism bill expected to conclude this May or June. Speaking to The Jakarta Post in an interview on Thursday, Enny Nurbaningsih, head of President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo administration's team to deliberate the antiterrorism bill, ensured the new legislation could provide security for Indonesians against deadly terror attacks such as those that had occurred recently in numerous places across Indonesia's most populated island of Java. Calls for the government and the House of Representatives to conclude the long-due deliberation on the bill have mounted after the attacks, which were allegedly conducted by an Islamic State (IS)-linked local jihadist organization known as Jamaah Ansharud Daulah (JAD). Enny, who is also head of the Law and Human Rights Ministry's National Law Development Agency (BPHN), said the government expected deliberations to be concluded at a hearing with the parliament scheduled for May 23, saying that nearly ""99 percent"" of the bill’s content had been finalized, and only the debate over the definition of terrorism as a crime remained to be concluded. Below are some crucial points in the antiterrorism bill, which was initiated after the Jan. 14, 2016 bombings on Jl. MH Thamrin, one of Jakarta's busiest thoroughfares.  What is terrorism? One of the main reasons the deliberations have been dragging on for months is that the government and the House have failed to reach an agreement on what constitutes terrorism. While the government insists that terrorism is ""any deed that uses violence or threats of violence on a massive scale, and/or causes damage to strategic vital objects, the environment, public facilities or international facilities"", the House demands that terrorism as a crime includes ""any deed that is based on political and ideological motives and/or threats to state security."" Lawmakers have said a detailed and rigid definition of terrorism as a crime would ensure that investigators crack down on terrorist activities, while the government believes it would only hamper terrorism prevention and mitigation processes, as it would obligate investigators to determine whether suspects had either political or ideological motives before naming them as terrorists. Enny said the government would accommodate the parliament's request by inserting the latter's version in the general explanation part of the bill, not in the verse section of it. The government expects to convey that proposal to the parliament at the scheduled May 23 hearing, so that the bill can be further deliberated before being proposed for the next plenary meeting. Law enforcers will have greater powers. The new terrorism law will include numerous provisions on terrorism prevention measures -- something that is not dealt with comprehensively in the prevailing terror law, Enny said. ""For instance, we can do nothing to people who plan terror attacks if we use the prevailing law,"" said Enny. Under the bill, plotting terror attacks is a crime. The bill stipulates that a person accused of terrorism could be held in custody from seven to 14 days without charges. Law enforcers could hold them for up to 200 days after officially charging them with terrorism. Rights activists have voiced concerns over the policy, but Enny ensured that the policy would be carried out in accordance with human rights principles. If there is a law enforcement officer found guilty of violating human rights principles during the terrorism investigation process, they will be charged with a criminal offense, said Enny. People who import explosives or components such as chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or radioactive weapons for terrorism purposes into the country, or make, receive or possess them, can be charged under Article 10a of the bill, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment. The bill also charges people who mastermind terror attacks, partake in paramilitary training with the purpose of launching terror attacks or join overseas wars related to terror attacks, with maximum terms ranging from 12 years, 15 years, 20 years to life sentence and the death penalty. That means the police will later be able to charge Indonesians returning from war-torn countries where they are proven to have joined a terrorist group such as IS. Terrorism prevention measures also include what the bill describes as ""counter-radicalization"" and ""deradicalization"" activities. Counter-radicalization activities are intended for people or groups that have been exposed to radical teachings that could potentially lead them to committing terror attacks. Deradicalization activities are intended for terrorist suspects, defendants, convicts, inmates or former inmates and aim to reintegrate these people into society. The bill says counter-radicalization and deradicalization activities will be detailed in other supporting regulations. The roles of the Indonesian Military (TNI) The decades-long rivalry between the two institutions to handle and manage state security has been apparent during the deliberation of the terrorism bill. Activists have also warned about possible abuse of power carried out by the two authorities in handling terrorism. Enny ensured that, while the bill finally included a provision on the role of the TNI in countering terrorism, the military would not be involved in law enforcement. “To prevent the military from entering the domain of law enforcement, we have decided that the President will regulate the TNI’s involvement through a government regulation.” The regulation will refer to the 2004 TNI Law, which stipulates that the TNI’s involvement in civilian affairs depends on the political decision of the state, which should be consulted with the House. Victims of terror attacks have long sought comprehensive provisions about their rights as victims. Yayasan Penyintas Indonesia, an organization that supports terror victims, detailed in 2016 that over 1,900 victims of terror attacks suffered from physical and mental trauma from a number of bomb attacks that had occurred since the start of the millennium. House terrorism bill committee chairman Muhammad Syafi'i said last year that ""the well-being of victims has been one of our biggest concerns since the beginning of the deliberation."" The terrorism bill has one special chapter dedicated to detailing protection for victims of terror attacks. The bill acknowledges two kinds of victims: direct victims, for example victims who are killed or injured in attacks, and indirect victims, for example wives who lose their husbands as a result of a terror attack. The bill says terror victims are the ""responsibility of the state"", a responsibility which is fulfilled by providing medical assistance, psychosocial and psychological rehabilitation, as well as financial compensation for the families of the deceased.

Orphaned children used in terror attacks struggle with severe trauma,"The suicide bombings in Surabaya and Sidoarjo, both in East Java, have left the perpetrators’ children severely traumatized after they were used as part of their parents’ terror plot. Seven-year-old AAP is now undergoing treatment by the East Java Police for severe trauma and physical injuries she sustained when her parents took her and her two siblings to the Surabaya Police headquarters on Monday and detonated a bomb that had been strapped to their bodies. Her parents and siblings were killed in the blast. East Java Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Frans Barung Mangera said on Wednesday that AAP’s injuries were improving, but her mental state would likely take time to recuperate. AAP is reportedly able to speak, but responds to questions with a brief “yes” or “no”. When pressed for longer answers, she lapses into silence. She received on Wednesday several visitors who offered her support, including Seto Mulyadi, chairman of the Indonesian Child Protection Agency (LPAI). AAP’s grandfather and uncle also came to visit her on Wednesday. AAP may choose to live with them, but East Java Police chief Insp. Gen. Machfud Arifin said he himself would carefully determine where and with whom the child would live to ensure she would not be exposed to radical ideologies. “It will be my own authority to approve who can adopt AAP,” Machfud said. During Wednesday visit, her uncle and grandfather refused to acknowledge AAP’s parents as their relatives, said Frans. So far, no one has stepped forward to claim the bombers’ bodies. If they remain unclaimed, the police said they would bury them in accordance with their religious beliefs. In a video footage of moments after the blast occurred, AAP was seen standing up from the ruins of a car affected by the blast. She looked shaken when a police officer quickly came to rescue her. (Antara/Didik Suhartono) In a video taken moments after the blast at Surabaya Police headquarters, AAP’s small figure could be seen rising from the ruins of a motorcycle her family had used. As she swayed unsteadily on her feet, a police officer rushed forward to scoop her up and carry her away from the still smoldering wreckage. According to the police, AAP had been staying at her grandparents’ home when her mother picked her up on Wednesday morning, then drove her to the police headquarters. AAP reportedly survived the blast because she did not have explosives strapped to her body. She is not the only child to have survived and been used as part of a terror attack. FPH, 11, HU, 11, and AR, 15 were orphaned after their father Anton Febriyanto and mother Puspitasari were killed in an explosion at a low-cost apartment in Wonocolo, Sidoarjo, on Sunday night. The bomb, to be used in another attack in Surabaya, accidentally went off as it was being assembled by Anton. One of their siblings was also killed in the incident. FPH and HU are also being treated by the East Java Police. AR was not at the scene at the time of the incident. The police said that AR had not been exposed to radical teachings because he lived with his grandparents. During his visit, Seto said that the children being treated were improving and would likely be allowed to return to their relatives soon. He added that LPAI would monitor the orphans, including by giving them any help they needed. These children, he said, were not terrorists, but victims of their parents’ radicalism."
"Abu Sayyaf hunter, peace advocate named new AFP chief","MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday named Lt. Gen. Carlito Galvez of the Western Mindanao Command as the new chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the second significant change the chief executive announced to his security officials today. Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said that the start of Galvez's term of office and that of Director Oscar Albayalde as Philippine National Police chief, the president's other major security appointment, would be on April 14. “The president just said that please announce that it is Lieutenant General Carlito Galvez as the next AFP chief of staff,” Roque said in a press conference in the Palace. Galvez is the chief of the Zamboanga City-based Western Mindanao Command, the area command that covers Marawi City, the scene of intense five-month fighting between government forces and Islamic State-inspired Maute and Abu Sayyaf terrorists last year. He is also an Army Scout Ranger officer and a veteran of operations against the Abu Sayyaf. He is the overall commander of the military’s anti-terrorism campaign against militants in Marawi and the rest of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. Westmincom told Philstar.com that is has yet to issue an official statement on the appointment. Galvez will replace Gen. Rey Leonardo Guerrero as military chief, whose term of office was supposed to end in December but was extended by four more months. Galvez and Guerrero were the top two contenders to replace AFP chief Eduardo Año when he retired last year. The president eventually opted for Guerrero, who was then the military commander in charge of Duterte's hometown of Davao City and was the more senior officer. Under Galvez's command, several top commanders of the Abu Sayyaf group were captured, the most recent of which was militant leader Nhurhassan Jamiri, who was wanted for bombings and kidnappings in several towns and cities in Mindanao. 'Soft-hand approach' Despite his image as an Abu Sayyaf hunter, Galvez also espouses a “soft-hand approach” in dealing with militants. He said that killing a terrorist might result in three or four relatives taking up arms for themselves. “If you will be able to reform one hardcore terrorist, all of his followers and his relatives will be reformed also,” Galvez said, adding that this was the best way to break the chain of violence committed by the Abu Sayyaf group. Galvez, while commander of the 6th Infantry Division, was also instrumental in the peace process with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which signed a peace deal with the government in 2014. The announcement of Galvez as the new military chief capped a day of whirlwind announcements of resignation and appointments. Duterte announced that he had already accepted the resignation of Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II and appointed Menardo Guevarra as his replacement. The president also announced that National Capital Region Police Office Director Albayalde would replace Director General Ronald Dela Rosa as the Philippine National Police head. "
"Military to secure Basilan infa projects, workers vs Abu Sayyaf","COTABATO CITY, Philippines — The military has assured personnel of the Basilan District Engineering Office of protection from bandits trying to sabotage infrastructure projects in the island province. Last week, two Basilan DEO workers were killed in an ambush in Lamitan City last week by members of the Abu Sayyaf. Two others were seriously wounded in the attack. The Islamic State-inspired Abu Sayyaf has been trying to delay the construction of more roads, schools and agricultural facilities in remote Basilan barangays where its members collect money from residents at gunpoint. Lt. Gen. Carlito Galvez, Jr. of the Western Mindanao Command said Wednesday he has reiterated a standing order for military units in Basilan to secure all Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao projects from sabotage. Basilan is a component province of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. ""They are angry because their camps have become within easy reach of police and military forces as a positive outcome of the implementation in Basilan of road projects by the present ARMM administration,"" Galvez said Wednesday. Galvez said it was for the livelihood opportunities generated by the ARMM infrastructure projects that more than a hundred Abu Sayyaf members in Basilan decided to return to the fold of law in the past 16 months. ""Remnants of this group are trying their best to stop the construction of more roads that would traverse the remaining areas where they can freely roam. We have intensified our security efforts to prevent them from executing their bad plans,"" Galvez said. Galvez said intelligence agents are also helping now protect Basilan’s district engineer, Soler Undug, whose house was bombed by Abu Sayyaf bandits last week. “We are not taking chances. Engineer Undug and his subordinates are in the forefront of all these infrastructure development initiatives in Basilan,” Galvez said. It was the Abu Sayyaf’s fourth attempt to kill Undug using improvised explosive devices in about three years. "
Abu Sayyaf beheads couple in Sumisip,"ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines — Abu Sayyaf militants beheaded a couple they considered ""kafir"" (Arabic for unbeliever or traitor) to their cause in a remote village in Sumisip town, Basilan on Thursday afternoon. A military source who asked not to be named for lack of authority to make public statements confirmed the deaths on Friday. The source said the couple was killed in Sitio Bacahan, Barangay Mahatalang, an area known to have a strong presence of the Abu Sayyaf group. “The couple was killed; the husband was a brother of an Abu Sayyaf member,” the military source said. Senior Superintendent Nixon Muksan, Basilan Provincial Police Office director, identified the victims as a certain Abdurahim Kituh of Sumisip and Nadzwa Bahitla of Isabela City. He said authorities learned of the incident after Cafgu Active Auxiliary member Ibrahim Wahab, who was on duty, heard gunshots in the area. Wahab found in Bahitla's body in the vicinity of Ismael Elementary School at Sitio Diangan, Barangay Mahatalang about 4:30 p.m. Kituh's body was found near the area around three hours later. The remains were recovered and turned over to their relatives in the area, according to Muksan. Police found that the Abu Sayyaf had warned residents before the incident not to pass through the area. The police also believe the group responsible in the beheading is led by Nahim Mustalim, an Abu Sayyaf member and Kituh's half-brother. Mustalim is said to be under the group of Usop Sandalan, a sub-leader of Abu Sayyaf commander Rhadzmil Janatil. Police said the killing may have been part of a rido or clan feud. But the military source disclosed that based on information on the ground, the Abu Sayyaf executed the victims after branding them ""kafir"" and ""infidels"". The military said it was not the first case the Abu Sayyaf group has killed former members who decided to surrender to rejoin mainstream seociety."
11 battalions back in Sulu to go after Abu Sayyaf leaders,"ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines — The military has redeployed 11 battalions to Sulu to go after the Abu Sayyaf and its leaders, the military Western Mindanao Command said. Lt. Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr., Western Mindanao Command chief, said troops aim to get ranking terrorist leaders by the end of the first quarter of 2018. Among the targets are senior leaders Radullan Sahiron and Hatib Hajan Sawadjaan, Galvez said. Sahiron, an aging one-armed militant leader, was earlier said to have sent feelers to arrange a surrender but the military found that it was a tactic to slow down operations. Galvez said the operation to crush the Abu Sayyaf was almost completed last year but units had to be deployed to Marawi against the Maute and Abu Sayyaf terrorists that laid siege to the capital of Lanao del Sur from May to October. “We have impending operations there in Sulu and the target is all the high-value targets must be neutralized by the first quarter,” Galvez said. Galvez said addressing the security problem in Sulu is very important to allow government development programs to go on full swing. He said the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao regional government have been supportive of the development campaign and has funded P500 million in infrastructure projects. Local government units and barangay leaders have already committed to leading the campaign to eradicate the Abu Sayyaf group, Galvez said. He said local leaders had helped prompt the surrender of more than 140 Abu Sayyaf members since last year. Westmincom has also recorded 127 militants killed and 90 captured in the same period. "
"Soldiers capture 3 Abu Sayyaf men in raid on their lair in Patikul, Sulu","Soldiers have captured three suspected members of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) in a raid on their lair in Patikul town of Sulu. Lt. Gen. Arnel dela Vega, commanding general of the Western Mindanao Command, said the ASG men were arrested during the operation in Barangay Maligay in Patikul town over the weekend. He identified them as Gafur Albani Absari, Medzfar Mangabong and Madjid Mangabong. They were turned over to 501st Brigade. The military has been trying to cripple the operation of the ASG in Sulu and Basilan, with the goal of licking the Abu Sayyaf problem before the end of the term of President Duterte. But recently, it was believed to have collected money again with the release of a kidnap victim which was abducted in Zamboanga del Sur in August this year. The ASG was tagged as responsible for the series of high-profile kidnappings in the past, involving both locals and foreigners which they would seize as far as Malaysia. It also gained notoriety for beheading their kidnap victims whose family would fail to pay their ransom demand."
Palace not threatened by Abu Sayyaf regrouping efforts,"Malacañang expressed confidence that the government will be able to overcome the threat of the Abu Sayyaf group (ASG) no matter how many times they try to regroup. Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque made the statement after the Straits Times reported that the terrorist group is looking to get back into the business of kidnap-for-ransom. “The resurrection of a kidnap-for-ransom group in the southern Philippines after a 21-month hiatus is posing fresh threats to Sabah’s east coast,” the report read. Malacañang, however, does not feel threatened by the report, saying the government is ready to overpower the group anew. “Handa po tayo harapin ang banta galing sa Abu Sayyaf. Kinakailangan po silang mag-regroup dahil napulbos na natin sila (We are ready for any threat coming from the ASG. They need to regroup because we already finished them off),” Roque said Thursday. “Asahan niyo po na kahit anong gawin nilang regroupment ang Abu sayyaf po kayang-kayang pulbusin ng ating gobyerno (Expect that the government can defeat them no matter how what kind of regroupment they do),” he added. Roque, meanwhile, welcomed the review of the United States State Department on the country’s campaign against terrorism and violent extremism. “The Country Reports on Terrorism 2017 of the US State Department mentioned the concrete steps that the country undertook to combat terrorism and prevent violent extremism,” Roque said. The report mentioned the continued inter-agency information sharing between Philippine law enforcement agencies; increased aviation security capacity; and active participation in trainings on crisis response, border security, and investigations including cybercrimes. It also noted that the Philippine government has consistently acknowledged the dangers from ISIS-affiliated terrorist groups and welcomed assistance on counterterrorism and reconstruction from Australia, Japan, and the United States."
Government troops still chasing 150 Abu Sayyaf terrorists — Lorenzana,"Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said that government troops are still hunting down close to 150 Abu Sayyaf terrorists in Basilan and Jolo. Lorenzana made the remark after President Rodrigo Duterte reminded soldiers to not allow themselves to fall victims or hostages of terrorists groups and urged them to destroy and kill them. In a speech in at Camp Teodulfo Bautista Headquarters, Brgy. Bus-bus, Jolo, Sulu Saturday night, Duterte said he will support the soldiers in their fight against terrorists. In a separate interview, Lorenzana said as far as he is concerned, there are still an estimated 100 Abu Sayyaf terrorists still hiding in Jolo while in Basilan there are about 35 of them still being pursued by the military. “Kaya nga mahirap hanapin dahil kakaunti na lang sila eh (That’s why its hard to find them because there number has dwindled),” Lorenzana told reporters during the heroes welcome accorded for the returning 700-man contingent on board BRP Davao del Sur (LD602) and BRP Andres Bonifacio (FF17) which participated in the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2018, the biggest and most prestigious naval exercise in the world held in Honolulu, Hawaii. The heroes welcome was held Monday at Pier 13, South Harbor, Manila. Lorenzana, in the same interview, said that the Abu Sayyaf suffered a significant drop in the number of their membera brought about by the relentless operatons conducted by troops comprising the Joint Task Force (JTF) Sulu and JTF Basilan. He added that a significant number of Abu Sayyaf terrorists have also surrended since the start of the year. “Oo signficant drop talaga (There was a significant drop). So kung meron naman silang window to surrender, kung magsu-surrender pero if they continue to create, to commit atrocities, (we wil go after them),” he said. Lorenzana said the Abu Sayyaf continues to hold a total of nine hostages in Jolo, Sulu, some of whom have been in captivity for two years already. Aside from the Abu Sayyaf, the military is also after some 100 to 150 members of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedoom Fighters (BIFF) in Central Mindanao. (Francis T. Wakefield)"
 22 soldiers wounded in clash with Abu Sayyaf in Sulu,"Twenty-two soldiers were wounded in a clash with Abu Sayyaf members in Sulu on Thursday morning, the military said. Troops from 41st Infantry Battalion clashed with about 40 terrorists under sub-leader Idang Susukan and Ben Tattoo in Barangay Langhub, in Patikul town around 9:30 a.m., a military report said. The encounter lasted about 45 minutes, which led to the death of a suspected terrorist identified as Alpata Abdurasa. The military said that 17 of the injured personnel were wounded by M203 shrapnel, three from gunshot wounds, and two were from recoilless rifle back blast. They were brought to a military hospital for medical attention. Additional troops were deployed to go after the terrorists who fled."
ISIS family' kill 13 in Indonesia,"SURABAYA: A family of six including two young daughters staged suicide bombings at three Indonesian churches during Sunday services, killing at least 13 people and wounding dozens in attacks claimed by the Islamic State group. The bombings at three churches in Surabaya were Indonesia's deadliest for years, as the world's biggest Muslim-majority country grapples with home-grown militancy and rising intolerance towards religious minorities. A further three people were killed and two wounded when another bomb exploded at an apartment complex in Surabaya, Indonesia's second largest city, just hours later, police said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. The church bombers -- a mother and father, two daughters aged nine and 12, and two sons aged 16 and 18 -- were linked to local extremist network Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) which supports IS, said national police chief Tito Karnavian. Local media reports say they may have returned from Syria, where hundreds of Indonesians have flocked in recent years to fight alongside IS in its bid to carve out a caliphate ruled by strict Islamic law. The mother, identified as Puji Kuswati, and her two daughters were wearing niqab face veils and had bombs strapped to their waists as they entered the grounds of the Kristen Indonesia Diponegoro Church and blew themselves up, Karnavian said. The father, JAD cell leader Dita Priyanto, drove a bomb-laden car into the Surabaya Centre Pentecostal Church while his sons rode motorcycles into Santa Maria church, where they detonated explosives they were carrying, Karnavian said. ""All were suicide attacks but the types of bombs are different,"" he said of the church attacks. The group, led by jailed radical Aman Abdurrahman, has been linked to several deadly incidents, including a 2016 gun and suicide attack in the capital Jakarta that left four attackers and four civilians dead. That was the first assault claimed by IS in Southeast Asia. Police on Sunday said four suspected JAD members were killed in a shootout during raids linked to a deadly prison riot this week. Five members of Indonesia's elite anti-terrorism squad and a prisoner were killed in clashes that saw Islamist inmates take a guard hostage at a high-security jail on the outskirts of Jakarta. IS claimed responsibility. Karnavian said Sunday's church attacks may have been revenge for the arrest of some of JAD's leaders and for the prison crisis which eventually saw the surrender of the radical inmates. The Pope offered support over ""the severe attack against places of worship"", while President Joko Widodo called for Indonesians to ""unite against terrorism"". ""The state will not tolerate this act of cowardice,"" he told reporters in Surabaya. East Java police spokesman Frans Barung Mangera confirmed the deaths of 13 people in the church bombings, with about 40 injured in the coordinated attacks at around 7:30 am (0030 GMT). Images showed a vehicle engulfed in flames and plumes of thick black smoke as a body lay outside the gate of Santa Maria Catholic church, with motorcycles toppled over amid the mangled debris. In addition to the suicide blast police experts defused two unexploded bombs at the Surabaya Centre Pentecostal Church. Later on Sunday night a bomb killed three people and wounded two, all from the same family, who occupied the fifth floor of a low-cost Surabaya apartment complex, East Java police spokesman Frans Barung Mangera said. ""Three people have died, two are in the hospital and one is safe,"" he texted via Whatsapp. The explosion hit the apartment complex about 9 pm, local media reported, and residents were evacuated from the building after the blast. Yono, tenant coordinator at the apartment block, said the family had lived there since 2015. Concerns about sectarian intolerance in Indonesia have been on the rise, with churches targeted in the past. Nearly 90 percent of Indonesia's 260 million people are Muslim, but there are significant numbers of Christians, Hindus and Buddhists. Police shot and wounded an IS-inspired radical who attacked a church congregation outside Indonesia's cultural capital Yogyakarta with a sword during a Sunday mass in February. Four people were injured. In 2000 bombs disguised as Christmas gifts and delivered to churches and clergymen killed 19 people on Christmas Eve and injured scores more across the country. The archipelago nation of some 17,000 islands has long struggled with Islamic militancy, including the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people -- mostly foreign tourists -- in the country's worst-ever terror attack. Sunday's bombings had the highest death toll since nine people were killed in 2009 attacks on two luxury hotels in Jakarta. Security forces have arrested hundreds of militants during a sustained crackdown in recent years that smashed some networks, and most recent attacks have been low-level and targeted domestic security forces. But the coordinated nature of Sunday's bombings suggested a higher level of planning, analysts said. ""Recent (previous) attacks have been far less 'professional',"" said Sidney Jones, an expert on Southeast Asian terrorism and director of the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict."

 Court postpones hearing for terror leader Aman Abdurrahman,"The court hearing scheduled for Friday morning in the terror trial of the most prominent ideologue in the Islamic State (IS) movement in Indonesia, Aman Abdurrahman, has been postponed for “technical difficulties”. The prosecutors encountered difficulties in transporting the defendant from his cell at the National Police’s Brigade Mobile headquarters (Mako Brimob) detention center in Depok, West Java, two days following a deadly riot that broke out between detainees and the police. “We cannot bring the defendant to the court, therefore we cannot read out the charges today. We request [a hearing] postponement,” prosecutor Anita told the South Jakarta District Court as quoted by kompas.com. The judicial panel granted the request and postponed the hearing until next Friday. Aman, the leader of terrorist group Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), is on trial for several recent bombing attacks in the country in recent years, including the deadly January 2016 bombing on Jl. MH Thamrin in Central Jakarta. Aman’s lawyer Asrudin Hatjani mentioned separately that prosecutors were unable to transport Aman to the court because conditions at the Mako Brimob detention center in Depok were unclear. The riot that broke out on Tuesday evening led to a prison siege that ended on Thursday morning with police forces storming the facility. Five police officers and one inmate were killed during the siege. Asrudin said he had tried to meet his client, but could not because the detention center was still closed to the public. From the information he had gathered from police officers, Aman was “in good condition” and was being held in a separate detention block from other IS-linked inmates. After the riot, the police have moved 145 of the 155 terrorist inmates involved in the rioting – not all 155 as reported earlier – from Mako Brimob to the Nusakambangan maximum security prison island in Cilacap, Central Java. Aman remains in detention at Mako Brimob as a defendant in ongoing court trials. The terrorist inmates, who held a police officer hostage during the nearly 40-hour siege, had demanded to speak with Aman during initial negotiations early on Tuesday, a demand the police later met. "
More deaths follow Indonesia prison riots,"JAKARTA: Indonesian police said Friday three more deaths occurred after they declared an end to a riot by Islamist militants at a detention centre near Jakarta, in which five police and one inmate died the day before. Another member of the elite Mobile Brigade police unit was stabbed to death late Thursday, the police said, shortly after a 38-hour standoff at the detention center in Depok was said to have ended with the surrender of rioting Islamic militants being held there. A 22-year-old university student allegedly stabbed and killed a 41-year-old intelligence officer inside the brigade's headquarters building, where the youth had been brought for questioning for acting suspiciously, according to National Police spokesman Setyo Wasisto. The young man died after being shot by another policeman, Setyo said. It was not immediately clear whether the student was a member of a terrorist network. ""We are still investigating his background,"" Setyo told a news conference. In a related incident, one suspected Islamist militant was killed and another wounded by police when a fight broke out while four men were being bought to Jakarta for questioning, according to Setyo. Police arrested the four men in the town of Bekasi in West Java Province early Thursday, after receiving intelligence reports that the four were on their way to the detention center near Jakarta to join the rioting Islamist militant detainees in fighting the police. While being brought to Jakarta for questioning, two of the four men attacked policemen who were escorting them and tried to grab their weapons. The policemen then shot them, killing one and injuring the other, Setyo said. ""Early investigation shows that the four men were members of the Islamic State-linked Jamaah Ansharut Daulah who planned to get involved in the detention center riot,"" he said, adding police had seized various kinds of weapons and ammunition from those men. When militant inmates began rioting at the detention center on Tuesday, radical Muslim groups called via social media for their followers to go to the Mobile Brigade's headquarters to help the inmates fight the police."
"Densus 88 members surround Mako Brimob, negotiate with terror inmates","Armed members of the Densus 88 anti-terrorism squad have surrounded the detention center at the National Police’s Brigade Mobile headquarters (Mako Brimob) amid a standoff with Islamic State-linked prisoners who are reportedly holding a police officer hostage following a riot on Tuesday night. The convicts are known to be armed after they killed five police officers and seized their guns during the riot, the police said. The authorities are negotiating with the militants for the hostage's release. National Police spokesman Insp. Gen. Setyo Wasisto said they had not set a deadline in negotiating with the terror convicts. There are about 130 convicts in the cells, housed in blocks A, B and C. “We have not set a deadline. The most important thing is that we reach an agreement, hopefully as soon as possible,” Setyo told reporters on Wednesday afternoon. At least four people have been deployed to negotiate with the convicts, who are allegedly connected to Amman Abdurrahman, a leader of terrorist group Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD). Amman is also being detained at the detention center. Asked why negotiations were taking a long time, Setyo said because some of the convicts’ demands were not acceptable. Setyo refused to say what the demands were, although unconfirmed reports said the militants were asking to meet local IS ideologue Aman Abdurrahman, who is currently on trial on terrorism charges. Setyo said the detention center was overcrowded, adding that they would review the facility after riot. The police claim that the riot was triggered by a “simple issue” of food that a relative of a convict brought from outside the prison for the inmate. "
Jakarta suicide bomb mastermind jailed for nine years,"The convicted mastermind of a deadly twin bombing in Jakarta last year claimed by the Islamic State group was sentenced to nine years in prison on Monday. Kiki Muhamad Iqbal, 38, was found guilty of organising the suicide attacks that killed three policemen and injured a dozen others at a busy bus station in the sprawling capital. Ahmad Sukri and Ikhwan Nur Salam, who died when they blew themselves up in the huge explosions in May 2017, had attended a mosque where Iqbal gave fiery sermons calling on Muslims to ""die as martyrs"", the North Jakarta court heard. ""(The defendant has been) proven, legally and convincingly, of committing the crime of plotting and mobilising others to commit a criminal act of terrorism,"" presiding judge Purwanto said. It was less than the 12-year jail term that prosecutors had demanded. Iqbal, who was arrested two weeks after the bombings, pleaded not guilty and said he had no knowledge that the two men would carry out an attack. He had already served time in jail after being convicted in 2011 of making bombs to be used in terror attacks. Iqbal is believed to be a student of radical cleric Aman Abdurrahman, the leader of the Islamic State (IS)-linked militant outfit Jamaah Ansharut Daulah. Abdurrahman is also currently on trial for masterminding a deadly 2016 attack in downtown Jakarta, claimed by IS, that killed four bystanders. Four militants died after they were shot or blew themselves up in the brazen midday attack. Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim-majority country, has long struggled with Islamist militancy and has been hit by a series of attacks in the past 15 years, including the 2002 Bali bombings that left 202 people dead."
"Trial of 2016 Jakarta terror attack ideologue hears how his sermons, blog radicalised others"," JAKARTA - A militant who headed a terror organisation founded by influential radical cleric Aman Abdurrahman told a court on Friday (March 9) that he had read a book written by the cleric, looked up to him and considered him a religious teacher. Zainal Anshori, 43, former head of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) was testifying in the trial of Aman, who is facing the death penalty for inciting others to commit various terror acts in Indonesia. JAD is an underground organisation which has been responsible for several terror incidents in Indonesia, including an attack in Jakarta in 2016 that left four bystanders dead and the Samarinda church attack in Kalimantan that killed a toddler in the same year. The book written by Aman entitled ""Seri Materi Tauhid"", which espouses an extremist interpretation of Islam, is a reference book for members of JAD, said Zainal, who admitted that Aman had appointed him as the organisation's head. ""Aman is not in the organisation structure of JAD but he is often consulted. He is above me,"" Zainal said. He claimed Aman never told his followers to launch a terror attack. Aman's book, among other things, denounces democracy as ""syirik"", or idolatry, and argues that Muslims have a duty to free themselves from such a system. The court on Thursday also heard from two other witnesses whom prosecutors grilled to build a stronger case against the radical cleric. Former terrorist bombmaker turned preacher, Kiki Muhammad Iqbal, 38, admitted that he attended sermons given by Aman, and supported his teachings. Kiki also said that Aman never incited others to commit terror acts. Kiki has been accused of delivering a sermon in Bandung on May 19, 2017, that allegedly incited Ahmad Sukri and Ikhwan Nur Salam, the two men who were killed while mounting a suicide attack near a bus station in Jakarta on May 24, 2017. The attack left three police officers dead. The third witness was Dodi Suridi, 23, who helped make the bomb used in the Jan 14, 2016 twin attacks on a police post and a Starbucks outlet in Jakarta that killed four innocent bystanders. Dodi admitted that he had an enormous hatred for the Indonesian government because it had curbed people from leaving the country for Syria to join the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Dodi also told he court he considered ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to be his president. He also disclosed that his hatred against the government grew stronger after reading a blog written by Aman. Dodi had earlier told police investigators that the blog discussed how apostates and those who insulted God had to be killed."
Thamrin bombing mastermind inspired by Paris attack: Prosecutor,"Aman Abdurrahman, the alleged mastermind of suicide bombings and shootings at Jl. MH Thamrin, Central Jakarta, in January 2016, was inspired by the Paris terror attack in November 2015, a prosecutor has said. The statement was written in the indictment read by prosecutor Anita Dewayani in a court hearing in the South Jakarta District Court on Thursday. Anita said a follower named Saiful Munthohir visited Aman in November 2015. At the time, Aman was serving time at Nusa Kambangan Prison in Cilacap, Central Java, for another terrorism case. Aman told Saiful about the plan for the attack on Jl. MH Thamrin, Anita said. ""The suspect whispered [to Saiful] that there was an order from a caliphate leader in Suriah to execute amaliyah [to perform religious practice] jihad, like what had been done in France,"" Anita said as reported by kompas.com. Aman then told Saiful to recruit a field coordinator that would execute the plan, she added. In December, Aman reportedly ordered four people to do the attack on Jl. Sabang, Central Jakarta, an area popular among foreigners. However, the plan changed when the perpetrators instead bombed a Starbucks and a police post in Sarinah, Jl. MH Thamrin, at 10:20 a.m. on Jan. 14, 2016. The bombs were made by Jamaah Ansharut Daulah in Cirebon, West Java, the prosecutor said. Aman is charged under the Terrorism Law on inciting others to commit terrorist acts. "
 Indonesian IS-linked militant jailed for 7 years,"The Indonesian leader of an Islamic State-linked militant group was jailed for seven years Monday over plans to smuggle weapons from the southern Philippines, a court said. Zainal Anshori, 43, head of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, was found guilty of committing a ""criminal act of terrorism"" by the Jakarta court. His group is believed to be responsible for several terror plots in Indonesia including a January 2016 attack in Jakarta that left eight people dead, including four militants. The cache of some 50 weapons, which did not reach their destination, were intended to be used in future attacks in Indonesia, the court said. Indonesia, the world's biggest Muslim majority nation, has been on heightened alert following a string of IS-inspired attacks and plots. Many jihadists from Indonesia -- which has long struggled with Islamist militancy -- have in recent years travelled to join IS in Syria and the Philippine city of Marawi. Foreign and local IS supporters ravaged Marawi before being defeated in October, ending a five-month conflict with the military that left about 1,100 people dead. Last week, a Jakarta court sentenced an Islamist militant to ten years in prison for buying a cache of guns from a rebel group in the Philippines."

Alleged terrorist acts as recruiter for militants overseas,"Jakarta (ANTARA News) - A police spokesman, Brigadier General Muhammad Iqbal, said the alleged terrorist Reza Nurjamil (26) acted as a recruiter of Indonesians to fight as terrorists in foreign countries. ""He played his role to send some people from Indonesia to foreign countries,"" Iqbal remarked here on Friday. Currently, Reza is under police investigation in Jakarta. ""He is now in Jakarta, and still under questioning."" The police`s anti-terrorism unit Densus 88 has also tracked down other suspects in the network. Reza was arrested by Densus 88 in Angkasa Street of Nunukan village in North Kalimantan on December 31. Reza is reportedly a member of the Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), and comes from Tasikmalaya, West Java. The JAD was responsible for several deadly terror attacks in Indonesia last year, including a suicide bombing at the Kampung Melayu bus terminal in East Jakarta in May, and an attack on a police station in Dharmasraya, West Sumatra, in November. Reza sent Indonesians to the Philippines via Nunukan. The anti-terrorism unit has seven days from the day of arrest to name Reza as a suspect for his involvement in the terrorist network."
Two militants on motorcycle blow themselves up at Indonesian police HQ: Authorities," Two militants on a motorcycle blew themselves up at a police headquarters in Indonesia’s second biggest city Surabaya on Monday claiming at least one police casualty, authorities said, just a day after a wave of suicide bombings on churches killed at least 14 and injured dozens. Citing CCTV footage from the scene, East Java Police spokesman Frans Barung Mangera said a man and a woman on the bike stopped at the security checkpoint. “That’s where the explosion happened,” he added. “Two people were riding (on the motorcycle) and a woman was sitting at the back.” Authorities did not immediately say if the police officer at the checkpoint had been killed or injured. The deadly explosion comes just a day after a family of six including two young daughters staged suicide bombings at three churches in Surabaya during Sunday services. At least 14 have died as a result of that attack, which was claimed by the Islamic State group, and the toll could climb with more than 40 injured in hospital. The church bombers — a mother and father, two daughters aged nine and 12, and two sons aged 16 and 18 — were linked to local extremist network Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) which supports IS, police have said. A further three people in one family were killed and two wounded when another bomb exploded at an apartment complex about 30 kilometers from Surabaya, just hours later, police said. The mother and one child died from the explosion while police said they shot dead the father who was carrying a bomb detonator. Two other children were injured in the blast and were taken to the hospital. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the apartment bomb."
Four suicide bombers on motorbikes hit Indonesian police HQ,"SURABAYA, Indonesia: Four militants on two motorcycles blew themselves up at a police headquarters in Indonesia's second city Surabaya on Monday, wounding at least 10 people including officers, authorities said, a day after a deadly wave of suicide bombings hit churches. ""There were five people on two motorbikes. One of them was a little kid,"" national police chief Tito Karnavian said. ""This is one family."" An eight-year-old girl from the family survived the attack and was taken to hospital, while her mother, father and two brothers died in the blast, he said. The authorities said the wounded included six civilians and four police. Ambulances and the bomb squad descended on the chaotic scene with the CCTV images showed the mangled wreckage of a motorbike at the security gate at the headquarters in the heart of the city. There was no immediate claim of responsibility after the latest suicide bombing. ""This is a cowardly act, undignified and inhumane,"" Indonesian President Joko Widodo told reporters in Jakarta. ""There will be no compromise in taking action on the ground to stop terrorism."" The lethal explosion comes just a day after a family of six including two young daughters staged suicide bombings at three churches in Surabaya during Sunday services. At least 14 civilians have died as a result of that attack, which was claimed by the Islamic State group, and the toll could climb with more than 40 injured in hospital. - Multiple bombings - The archipelago nation of some 17,000 islands has long struggled with Islamic militancy, including the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people -- mostly foreign tourists -- in the country's worst-ever terror attack. The latest attack came just a day after a wave of suicide bombings on churches killed at least 14 Sunday's church bombings was Indonesia's deadliest attack in years. The attackers -- a mother and father, two daughters aged nine and 12, and two sons aged 16 and 18 -- were linked to local extremist network Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) which supports IS, police have said. Authorities said they believed some of the family members had recently returned from Syria, where hundreds of Indonesians have flocked in recent years to fight alongside IS in its bid to carve out a caliphate ruled by strict Islamic law. A further three people in another family were killed and two wounded when another bomb exploded at an apartment complex about 30 kilometres (20 miles) from Surabaya, just hours later, police said. The mother and one child died from the explosion while police said they shot dead the father who was carrying a bomb detonator. Two other children were injured in the blast and were taken to hospital. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the apartment bomb. In the church attacks, the mother, identified as Puji Kuswati, and her two daughters were wearing niqab face veils and had bombs strapped to their waists as they entered the grounds of the Kristen Indonesia Diponegoro Church and blew themselves up, police have said. The father, JAD cell leader Dita Priyanto, drove a bomb-laden car into the Surabaya Centre Pentecostal Church while his sons rode motorcycles into Santa Maria church, where they detonated explosives they were carrying, according to authorities. JAD, led by jailed radical Aman Abdurrahman, has been linked to several deadly incidents, including a 2016 gun and suicide attack in the capital Jakarta that left four attackers and four civilians dead. That was the first assault claimed by IS in Southeast Asia. Police on Sunday said four suspected JAD members were killed in a shootout during raids linked to a deadly prison riot this week. Five members of Indonesia's elite anti-terrorism squad and a prisoner were killed in clashes that saw Islamist inmates take a guard hostage at a high-security jail on the outskirts of Jakarta. IS claimed responsibility. Karnavian said Sunday's church attacks may have been revenge for the arrest of some of JAD's leaders and for the prison crisis which eventually saw the surrender of the radical inmates."
Al Qaeda-linked group claims Mali attack that killed two French troops,"NOUAKCHOTT: A Malian militant group with links to al Qaeda has claimed responsibility for an attack that killed two French soldiers in the West African country on Wednesday. The soldiers were killed after their armoured vehicle was hit by an explosive device near Mali's border with Niger and Burkina Faso, an area that has become increasingly dangerous for international forces seeking to quell Islamic insurgencies in the remote Sahel region. In October, militants killed four U.S. troops just over the border in Niger, sparking a debate about America's combat role in the vast and unpoliced scrubland just south of the Sahara. JNIM, which has been responsible for other attacks in Mali and has been linked to the kidnapping of at least six western hostages in recent years, claimed responsibility for Wednesday's attack late on Friday on two Mauritanian websites, through which the group has previously communicated. Islamist militants took over northern Mali in 2012 before French forces pushed them back in 2013. But since then the threat has crept back, and attacks have occurred further and further south, into neighbouring Niger and Burkina Faso, and as far afield as Ivory Coast. In a bid to counter the insurgents, international donors on Friday pledged half a billion dollars towards the G5 Sahel, an international force made up of troops from Mali, Niger, Chad, Burkina Faso and Mauritania."
 Suspected al Shabaab attack kills two Kenyan teachers,"NAIROBI: Two Kenyan teachers were killed on Wednesday when suspected al Shabaab militants threw an explosive device at a teacher’s house in Mandera county near the Somali border, police said. The teachers were killed in a fire caused by the explosion in the attack at 1 a.m. (2200 GMT on Tuesday) at Arabia Boys Secondary School, police said on Twitter. Police reservists guarding the school ""engaged the attackers who then fled as more reinforcements were mobilized"", police said.

20-year-old IS supporter who planned attack on Better Beer Festival 2017 to spend 9 years in jail,"KUALA LUMPUR: A 20-year-old Islamic State (IS) supporter was sentenced to a total of 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to four terrorism related charges, including a planned attack on the Better Beer Festival 2017 which had been scheduled for October last year. However, Muhamad Hafizi Mat Jusoh will spend only nine years in prison as High Court judge Datuk Mohd Sofian Abd Razak ordered the sentences to be served concurrently. Before pronouncing the sentence, Sofian advised Hafizi to study while in prison and try to do something which would make the nation proud as he was still young. In the first charge, Hafizi was alleged to have given training via a WhatsApp group, “The Rise of Jundullah”, between 9.07pm and 10.28pm on Sept 23 last year, on how to make an explosive device to a group of people who were ready to conducted a terror attack in Kota Baru. He was charged under Section 130F(a) of the Penal Code which carries a maximum 30 years’ jail and fine upon conviction. ADVERTISING In the second charge, Hafizi was alleged to attended a training session at an empty plot of land in Gong Kulim, Pasir Puteh in Kelantan, between 3.30pm and 4pm on Oct 10 last year, as preparation for the terror attack on the festival. The second charge was under Section 130FB(1)(a) of the Penal Code which carries a maximum jail term of 10 years or fine upon conviction. In the third charge, the youngest of nine siblings was alleged to have owned 57 items linked to IS and two items linked to al-Qaeda in his mobile phone at Restoran K&K, Lot 2689, Jalan Tok Janggut, Kampung Kelubi in Pasir Puteh, Kelantan at 4.30pm, also on Oct 10 last year. For this, he was charged under Section 130JB(1)(a) of the Penal Code which carries a jail term of up to seven years or fine upon conviction. In the fourth charge, Hafizi was alleged to have uploaded 13 videos and five pictures involving IS, al-Qaeda and another terrorist group, Jemaah Ansharut Tauhid, on his Instagram account using the handle “al_akh_fillah” using his mobile phone. This offence, under Section 130JB(1)(b) which also carries the same sentence as the third charge, was alleged to have taken place at the same restaurant, at the same time. Sofian handed down a sentence of nine years’ imprisonment for the first charge, five years for the second charge and three each for the third and fourth charges. He ordered the sentences to be carried out concurrently from the date of Hafizi’s arrest on Oct 10, 2017. In mitigation, Hafizi’s lawyer Ariff Azami pleaded with the court to hand down a light sentence, as his client was young, came from a good background and had a bright future ahead if given a chance. “He had never forgotten his studies and even sat for the Sijil Tinggi Pelajaran Malaysia exam while in the Pengkelan Chepa prison while awaiting trial.” Deputy public prosecutor Muhammad Fadzlan Mohd Noor, however, asked the court to hand down an appropriate sentence as this was a serious matter as the accused had made concrete and detailed plans to launch a terror attack."
"Scores poisoned in Aleppo gas attack, Syria and Russia blame rebels","BEIRUT (Reuters) – More than 100 people were wounded in Syria’s Aleppo late on Saturday in a suspected toxic gas attack which the government and its ally, Russia, blamed on insurgents. A health official in Aleppo said victims suffered breathing difficulties, eye inflammation and other symptoms suggesting the use of chlorine gas. Rebel officials denied the allegations Russia’s defense ministry said on Sunday its warplanes bombed militants in the insurgent stronghold of Idlib who it accused of firing poison gas at Aleppo. Major-General Igor Konashenkov said Moscow sent advance warning to Ankara, which backs some rebel factions and helped broker a ceasefire in Idlib. A monitoring group said air strikes hit rebel territory in northwest Syria on Sunday for the first time since Russia and Turkey agreed a buffer zone there in September. In Aleppo city, which the government controls, the shells had spread a strong stench and caused breathing problems, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said. State news agency SANA said on Sunday 107 people were injured, including children, after militants hit three districts with projectiles containing gases that caused choking. It marks the highest such casualty toll in Aleppo since government forces and their allies clawed back the city from rebels nearly two years ago. “We can not know the kinds of gases but we suspected chlorine and treated patients on this basis because of the symptoms,” Zaher Batal, the head of the Aleppo Doctors Syndicate, told Reuters. Hospitals had discharged many people overnight. Batal said this was the first gas attack against civilians in the city since the conflict erupted more than seven years ago. STRETCHERS AND OXYGEN MASKS Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar and his Russian counterpart agreed on Sunday that “recent provocations” were aimed at harming the agreement on Idlib, the ministry said. “There was an exchange of views to the effect that … they could continue and that one needed to be ready for them,” the ministry said in a statement. Nobody has claimed the Aleppo attack so far. “The explosive (shells) contain toxic gases that led to choking among civilians,” the city’s police chief Issam al-Shilli told state media. Pictures and footage on SANA showed medical workers carrying patients on stretchers and helping them with oxygen masks. Syria’s foreign ministry urged the U.N. Security Council to condemn and punish the attack. Abdel-Salam Abdel-Razak, an official from the Nour el-Din al-Zinki insurgent faction, said rebels did not own chemical weapons or have the capacity to produce them. Abu Omar, a Failaq al-Sham spokesman, accused Damascus of trying to create “a malicious charade” as a pretext to attack rebel towns. The UK-based Observatory said government shelling earlier on Saturday had killed two women and seven children in a village in Idlib. The Russian-Turkish deal in September for a demilitarized zone staved off an army offensive against the Idlib region, including nearby parts of Aleppo and Hama provinces. The dominant force among an array of factions holding sway in Idlib is Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist alliance led by fighters formerly linked to al-Qaeda. A past U.N.-OPCW inquiry found the Syrian government used the nerve agent sarin in 2017 and also used chlorine several times. It also blamed Islamic State for using mustard gas. Damascus has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons in the war. No rebel group has been confirmed to have used chemical weapons in the war by the by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)."

Bomb hidden in vegetables kills at least 20 in Pakistan market,"At least 20 people were killed and 50 wounded when a bomb hidden in a carton of vegetables ripped through a crowded marketplace in Pakistan's restive northwestern tribal region Friday, officials said. The attack took place during the regular Friday bazaar in Kalaya, a town in a Shiite-dominated area of Orakzai tribal district, senior local official Khalid Iqbal told AFP. ""According to our initial investigation, it was an improvised explosive device hidden in a carton of vegetables,"" he said. A second official, Ali Jan, confirmed the toll. Orakzai is one of seven restive semi-autonomous tribal regions on the Afghan border, an area that has long been a focal point in the global war on terror and was famously described by Barack Obama as ""the most dangerous place in the world"". Washington has insisted that the mountainous region provides safe havens to militants including the Afghan Taliban and Al Qaeda -- an allegation that Islamabad denies. Pakistan, which joined the US war on terror in 2001, says it has paid the price for the alliance. It has been battling Islamist groups in the tribal belt since 2004, after its army entered the region to search for Al-Qaeda fighters who had fled across the border following the US-led invasion of Afghanistan. Multiple bloody military operations have been carried out in the area, officially known as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and home to around five million ethnic Pashtuns. Security has improved in the region in recent years, though lower-level attacks are still carried out with devastating regularity, often targeting Shiites in the area. But it remains notorious for the availability of cheap guns and smuggled goods, along with narcotics including hashish and opium grown in both the FATA and neighbouring Afghanistan. Residents also complain of undue harassment by security forces, citing disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Earlier this year Pakistan passed legislation which paves the way for the tribal areas to be merged into neighbouring Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, bringing them into the political mainstream. The move will impose the Pakistani judicial system on a region still loosely governed by British colonial-era laws and the tribal system of honour, and which has always existed on the fringes of the state."
Bomb hidden in vegetables kills at least 31 in Pakistan market,"PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AFP) - At least 31 people were killed and 50 wounded when a bomb hidden in a carton of vegetables ripped through a crowded marketplace in Pakistan's restive northwestern tribal region on Friday (Nov 23), officials said.

""According to our initial investigation, it was an improvised explosive device hidden in a carton of vegetables,"" he said. Shahbaz Ali, a resident who was buying food in the market, said he had seen a boy with his face covered ride up on a motorcycle. ""Suddenly a blast took place and then I was unconscious,"" he told AFP. Senior official Ameen Ullah said 31 people had been killed, including 22 Shi'ite Muslims. More than 50 people were wounded, with 17 of them in critical condition, he said. Many of the wounded were taken to a hospital in Kohat, a city in neighbouring Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where doctors said all staff had been summoned to the trauma centre. Ambulances could be seen outside the hospital, where relatives were awaiting news of their loved ones. One man was searching people before they entered the building, a precaution against a secondary bombing targeting hospital staff. ""We have received one dead body and 28 injured, three of them were serious and taken to Peshawar,"" Fazl Ur Reham, deputy medical superintendent at the hospital, told AFP by telephone. Six other wounded were undergoing surgery, he said. Most of the injured had been hit by ball bearings and fragments of the bomb. ""We expect more injured from the site,"" he added.

Burkina Faso grapples with spreading jihadist peril,"ABIDJAN (Ivory Coast), Aug 18 ? Already burdened with jihadist violence in the north of the country, the fragile Sahel state of Burkina Faso must now confront the reality of an escalating threat in its east. Experts say the spread is the result of a squeeze on the insurgents in neighbouring Mali and Niger ? but to roll the rebels back, one of the world's poorest countries will have to dig deep into its threadbare pockets. Islamist attacks on Burkina Faso began in 2015, starting with cross-border incursions in the north. A toll released in April found that 133 people had died in the north in 80 attacks in three years, many of them state officials. Hundreds of schools and town halls have been closed. The capital Ouagadougou, in the centre of the country, has suffered three attacks in two years, leaving 60 dead. The east of the country is now in the firing line. Last weekend, five gendarmes and a civilian were killed when their convoy was ambushed at Fada N'Gourma, the main town of the Eastern Region. The lead vehicle in the convoy struck a mine, and those behind it came under heavy fire. “The method of attack isn't new ? we have had a number of this kind in the Sahel region. But this is the first in the Eastern Region,” said Abdoul-Karim Sawadogo, a West African security expert. “The Eastern Region has been in the eye of the storm for some time. It was already reputed for attacks by criminals but now it is starting to be targeted for terrorist attacks,” said Paul Koalaga, a consultant in geopolitics and security. On June 17, a policeman was killed in the town of Comin-Yanga in a simultaneous attack on the local police and gendarmerie stations. Ironically, the attacks in the east could be a result of pressure exerted on the jihadists in Mali and Niger by France's Barkhane force and the new G5 Sahel force, which pools troops from five states, said Sawadogo. “These repeat terrorist attacks in the east seem to be the work of Abou Walid al-Saharaoui, a warlord in the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara group,” he said. “He and his men have been routed in northern Mali and Niger, and ever since then, many people have been thinking that they may have retreated to the Eastern Region” in Burkina Faso. “The incidents there are consistent with his type of fighters, who specialise in ambush-style attacks, explosive devices and suicide attacks.” Koalaga said the combatants were mainly “Boko Haram remnants who are falling back from Niger.” Boko Haram is a hardline jihadist group that has caused the deaths of at least 20,000 people since it took up arms in northeast Nigeria in 2009. Its insurgency has spilt into neighbouring countries, including southern Niger, Chad and northern Cameroon. “Eastern Burkina is a sparsely-populated area and there are many forests where you can hole up,” a military specialist said, speaking condition of anonymity. The expert said Burkina Faso's anti-terrorism strategy was “not up to speed.” Its weak point, he said, was in the intelligence services, which were based on the Presidential Security Regiment ? a unit that was dismantled after an attempted coup in 2015 that implicated its former chief, General Gilbert Diendere who also served as the country's spymaster. “There has been a lot of effort, genuine will and reassuring talk by the government, but terrorism has clearly advanced,” said Koalaga. “Burkina has to commit major resources to tackle the problem and to stand on its own feet, and not just rely on the G5 Sahel.” "
Tunisia pays tribute to security forces killed in jihadist attack,"TUNIS, July 10 — Tunisia paid tribute yesterday to six members of its security forces killed the day before along the border with Algeria in the country’s bloodiest jihadist attack in more than two years. The attack comes as Tunisia prepares for what it hopes will be a surge in tourism after a spate of jihadist attacks in 2015 sent visitor numbers plunging. After the ceremony at the national guard base close to the capital, hundreds of people watched as several of the dead were laid to rest. A large procession led by members of the armed forces accompanied the body of guardsman Arbi Guizeni through the Tunis suburb of Douar Hicher. The six national guard members were killed, and three others wounded, when their cars were attacked Sunday morning with an improvised explosive device in the Ain Sultan area of the Jendouba border province. The three wounded guards were transferred to a military hospital in Tunis and their condition was stable yesterday, said guard spokesman Colonel Houssemeddine Jebabli. He said search operations launched Sunday were continuing but no arrests had been made. Okba Ibn Nafaa, a Tunisia-based division of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), late on Sunday claimed responsibility for the attack and said it had killed nine soldiers, according to the SITE Intelligence Group that monitors jihadist activity online. Okba Ibn Nafaa and the Tunisian branch of the Islamic State group, Jund al-Khilafa (Soldiers of the Caliphate), are active in the mountainous border region where the attack took place. Tunisia’s President Beji Caid Essebsi on televisiyesterday evening called for unity, saying “we want solidarity among the people which is not the case.” He also announced there would be a security council meeting on Tuesday to shed light on the attack. Sunday’s assault was the bloodiest in Tunisia since a March 2016 attack on security installations in the town of Ben Guerdane on the Libyan border. That attack killed 13 security forces and seven civilians. Tunisia’s tourism industry is still rebounding from a string of devastating attacks in 2015, including one at the National Bardo museum in Tunis and another targeting a beach resort in Sousse that together killed 59 foreign tourists and a Tunisian guard. In May, Tourism Minister Selma Elloumi Rekik said the industry had made a “real recovery”. Since the 2011 uprising that toppled dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, jihadist attacks in Tunisia have killed dozens of members of the security forces and foreign tourists. The country has been under a state of emergency since November 2015, when an IS-claimed suicide bombing in Tunis killed 12 presidential guards. "
‘First’ woman arrested in Mali for helping jihadists make bombs," Mali’s intelligence services have arrested a Malian woman who was helping jihadists make explosives by supplying them with fertiliser, a first in the country badly hit by terror attacks, security sources told AFP on Friday. “On Thursday, we arrested a Malian woman in Bamako who was helping jihadists make explosives and mines by providing them sizeable quantities of fertiliser. She knew what the fertilizer was used for,” a Malian security source told AFP. The woman is from Mopti, in central Mali, where jihadists have struck repeatedly in recent months — often with homemade explosive devices. Investigators did not reveal the quantity of fertilizer delivered to the jihadists. They are now looking for “other accomplices,” according to the same source, who said the arrest was a first in Mali. “We still do not know the quantity of fertilizer that was provided. But imagine all the landmine and explosives victims!” another security source said, adding the woman was working closely with the Macina Liberation Front (FLM). The FLM is a jihadist group formed in 2015 and headed by a radical Malian preacher, Amadou Koufa, who hails from the Fulani community. Koufa pledged allegiance to the Al-Qaeda-linked Support Group for Islam and Muslims, the main jihadist alliance in the Sahel. The 34-year-old woman, who was arrested and detained in Bamako, looked wide-eyed and scared in a picture obtained by AFP. Landmines and explosives have killed scores in northern Mali, which fell into the hands of Al-Qaeda-linked jihadist groups in 2012. The extremists were largely driven out in a French-led military operation launched in January 2013. But large stretches of the country remain out of the control of the foreign and Malian forces, which are frequent targets of attacks, despite a peace accord signed with Tuareg leaders in mid-2015 aimed at isolating the jihadists. The violence has also spilled over into both Burkina Faso and Niger."
11 killed in Somalia market explosion: Security official,"MOGADISHU (AFP) - At least 11 people were killed in an explosion in a busy market in a small Somali city north of Mogadishu, a security official and witnesses said. ""Eleven people were confirmed dead and more than 10 others were wounded in the blast which we are still investigating, some of the victims have serious wounds and they are admitted at hospital,"" Mohamed Abdikarim, a regional security official, told AFP. Sources contacted by AFP did not yet know whether the blast was caused by a suicide bomber or an explosive device. The blast occurred at the marketplace in Wanlaweyn district about 70km north of the Somali capital where Khat (narcotic leaves) is sold. ""There was chaos at the market, a number of people died and others wounded, I saw the severed dead bodies of civilians but there were also security personnel involved in the casualty,"" Mohamed Dahir, a witness said. Wanlaweyn district is close to the Balidogle airbase where the US special forces have a major base. No group has so far claimed responsibility for the blast. The Shabaab, linked to Al-Qaeda, are known to be present in the region."
"KL says former Al-Qaeda man, 4 other terror suspects held","KUALA LUMPUR — Malaysia arrested five terror suspects last month (October), including a former Al-Qaeda operative who had dealings with the Afghanistan-based terror group’s slain leader, Osama bin Laden. National police chief Mohamad Fuzi Harun said the five held comprised two Malaysians, a Pakistani, an Egyptian and a Middle Eastern man. They were detained in Selangor, Perak, Kuala Lumpur and Sabah by counter-terrorism officers during the operation from Oct 13 to Oct 26. The two Malaysians – a man and a woman – had allegedly channelled funds to their compatriot, Muhammad Wanndy Mohamed Jedi, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) recruiter killed in a drone strike in Raqqa last year. The 32-year-old woman arrested in Kuala Lumpur on Oct 25 had allegedly moved money to Wanndy between 2014 and 2017. The 40-year-old service manager from Sabah was held on Oct 26, also for allegedly channelling funds to Wanndy and the latter’s would-be successor, Muhamad Fudhail Omar, who was also killed in Syria last year. He is also alleged to have helped fund the Filipino militant group Abu Sayyaf since 2015. Abu Sayyaf is notorious for demanding ransom after abducting people off the coast of Sabah, which faces the southern Philippines. Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi said the Egyptian suspect had worked in Kuala Lumpur. “The first suspect is a 50-year-old Egyptian working as an executive manager in a Kuala Lumpur firm, and was detained in Selangor on Oct 13. “The suspect was an Al-Qaeda member while in Afghanistan from 1988 to 1993. He had met Osama bin Laden,” he added. The Egyptian had used fake travel documents to enter Canada and Azerbaijan, as well as Pakistan, and has been previously arrested in Canada and Egypt for the same offense. According to Inspector-General Mohamad Fuzi, the other two foreigners were apprehended on Oct 20 and Oct 25, respectively. The 31-year-old Middle Easterner was intercepted at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. “He had issued a death threat against a foreign diplomat in Kuala Lumpur and is suspected (of) involvement in terrorism,” the police chief said. The Pakistani, a 31-year-old laborer, was taken into custody in the town of Sitiawan, Perak, after police discovered his involvement in Lashkar-e-Taiba, one of the largest and most active Islamist terror groups in South Asia, mainly operating in Pakistan. The trained militant has been in Malaysia since 2016. Malaysia has arrested more than 420 terror suspects since 2013, and foiled plots aimed largely at launching attacks locally. The country’s first and only terrorist attack took place in June 2016, when two men on a motorcycle lobbed a grenade into a nightclub in Selangor, injuring eight people. The men were sentenced to 25 years’ jail."
"Al Shabaab attacks African Union base in Somalia, says military","MOGADISHU, April 1 — Islamist insurgents battled for hours on Sunday with African Union troops after exploding a car bomb outside their base, Somali police, military and the militants said. Al Shabaab militants attacked the African Union (AU) peacekeepers’ base in the town Bulamarer, 130 kilometres to the northwest of the capital Mogadishu, around 9 a.m. local time, residents from the area told Reuters. Since withdrawing from Mogadishu in 2011, the al Qaeda-linked group has lost control of most of Somalia’s cities and towns. But it still retains a strong presence in regions outside the capital. The militants initially detonated two suicide car bombs that hit one AU vehicle and one Somali military vehicle, Somali army major Farah Osman, who is stationed near the AMISOM (African Union Mission in Somalia) base, said. “Then a large number of al Shabaab fighters began firing from under the trees ... it was a hellish battle,” he said, adding there was an unknown number of casualties. The phone of the spokesman for the AMISOM force based in Mogadishu was switched off on Sunday and Reuters was unable to reach any other officials from the force for comment. Abdiasis Abu Musab, a spokesman for al Shabaab said 14 of the group’s fighters and 59 AMISOM troops were killed in the incident. A police major stationed in a nearby town also said two car bombs exploded outside the base before the al Shabaab fighters entered it. Major Nur Ali told Reuters that Somali and AMISOM forces had attacked al Shabaab in rural areas near the base on Saturday night. “Then al Shabaab attacked this morning as a revenge,” he said. Somalia has been mired in civil war since 1991."
 Suicide bomber kills three senior military officials in Somalia,"BOSASO (Somalia), April 28 — A suicide bomber killed three senior military officials in the Somali town of Galkayo today, police said, an attack claimed by the al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab group.

"Gunmen kidnap Italian volunteer, shoot children near Kenya's coast","NAIROBI, Nov 21 — Gunmen kidnapped an Italian volunteer and shot and wounded a woman and four children in Kenya late on Tuesday, police and witnesses said - the first abduction of a foreigner there since raids blamed on Somali Islamist militants six years ago. Men armed with AK-47 rifles seized the 23-year-old woman from a guesthouse in Chakama, a small town close to the southeast coast, officers and local residents said. Police said they had not identified the attackers and no group immediately claimed responsibility. The Italian charity the woman was working for, Africa Milele, posted a short message on its website saying: “There are no words to comment on what is happening. Silvia, we are all with you.” The group says it helps orphaned children Two witnesses told Reuters they heard the gunmen speaking Somali. “There were three attackers and they targeted the Italian lady,” said Chad Joshua Kazungu. The woman was seized after she came out of her room to find out what was going on, a third unnamed witness told Kenyan TV channel KTN News. “Their aim was to get money but they took off with her to the river,” he said. The attackers opened fire as they left, wounding a woman and four children, he added. A 10-year-old child was shot in the eye and a 12-year-old was hit in the thigh, police said. Today a police helicopter circled over the green and yellow guesthouse where the volunteer had stayed. Chakama in Kenya’s Kilifi region is 60 km inland from the bustling coastal tourist resort of Malindi. A series of abductions further north in 2011 and 2012 - and other attacks by al Qaeda-linked Al Shabaab militants from neighbouring Somalia - caused a slump in tourism numbers and revenue. But local tour operators said they thought yesterday’s attack would only have a limited impact on the vital tourism industry. “The European market might have a small shake-up, but Malindi is 500 km from Nairobi so I don’t expect the safari industry to be affected,” said Robert Katithi, sales director from Go Kenya Tours and Safaris. Gunmen grabbed a wheelchair-bound French woman from her home on the northern island of Manda in 2011 weeks after pirates killed a British man and kidnapped his wife from another resort island. The French woman died while she was still be held, while the English woman was released after a ransom was paid. At the time, the Kenyan government blamed al Shabaab - which has launched attacks inside Kenya in retaliation for Nairobi’s military interventions in Somalia. The militants denied responsibility. Armed men kidnapped four aid workers and killed a driver at Kenya’s Dadaab refugee camp near the border with Somalia in 2012. The Italian foreign ministry said today it was aware of the reports of the abduction and was looking into the situation. "
Death toll from Mogadishu bombings jumps to over 40,"MOGADISHU (AFP) - The death toll from a series of car bombings near a popular hotel in the Somali capital Mogadishu has jumped to at least 41, police said on Saturday (Nov 10). Friday's attack was the latest in a wave of bombings by Al-Shabaab, an Al-Qaeda affiliate which has been fighting to overthrow the internationally-backed Somali government for over a decade. Twin car bombs exploded within moments of each other, followed by gunfire and a third blast, sending thick plumes of black smoke into the sky. Police official Ibrahim Mohamed said that information received from various hospitals indicated that the number of dead had reached 41, with another 106 wounded. ""Most of these people were civilians and nearly 20 of them died in minibuses that were passing by the road when the blast occurred,"" he added. Another security official, Abdirahman Osman, told AFP that nearly 50 had been confirmed dead so far, although the final number was not yet known. Officials on Friday had put the death toll at about 20."
"Malaysia arrests 5 terror suspects, including man who threatened to kill foreign diplomat"," KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's counter-terrorism police have arrested five terror suspects, including a Middle Eastern man who threatened to kill a foreign diplomat in Kuala Lumpur. The suspects, comprising two Malaysians, one Egyptian, one Pakistani and one Middle Eastern man, were arrested in an operation between Oct 13 and Oct 26, said Inspector-General of Police Mohd Fuzi Harun in a press statement on Wednesday (Oct 31). “The (Middle Eastern) suspect, aged 31, is unemployed and is involved in a case of threatening to kill a foreign diplomat in Kuala Lumpur,” said Fuzi, adding that the suspect was arrested at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The Egyptian national, who works in a private firm as an executive manager, was arrested in Selangor. The 50-year-old was a former member of Al-Qaeda during his time in Afghanistan from 1988 to 1993, and had met Osama bin Laden. “The suspect admitted to using fake travel documents to enter Canada, Azerbaijan and Pakistan,” said Fuzi. “The suspect has been arrested and jailed before in Canada and Egypt for his involvement in terror activities and use of fake travel documents,” he added. A senior intelligence source told Channel NewsAsia that the arrest and discovery of an Al-Qaeda member in Malaysia raise concerns about a resurgence of the militant group.  “We are investigating what are his activities in Malaysia. You must remember, Al-Qaeda is always planning for the long term,” said the source. “Al-Qaeda came to KL in 1999 to plan the 9/11 attack that was later carried out in 2001,” warned the source. The Pakistani arrested in Sitiawan, Perak is a 31-year-old labourer believed to be involved with the Lashkar-e-Taiba terror group. “The suspect has undergone para-military training at Lashkar-e-Taiba’s camp,” said Fuzi, adding that the suspect entered Malaysia in August 2016. The two Malaysians arrested were suspected of giving money to Malaysian Islamic State (IS) member Muhammad Wanndy Mohamed Jedi, who was killed in Syria in 2017. One of the suspects is a woman working in a private firm who was arrested in Gombak, Selangor. The other suspect is a 40-year-old man who was arrested in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, where he worked as a service manager in a telecommunications company. The suspect channelled money to Muhammad Wanndy and another Malaysian, Muhamad Fudhail Omar, who was also in Syria. “The suspect also donated money to the Abu Sayyaf Group in southern Philippines between 2015 and 2018 with the aim of funding terror activities,” said Fuzi."
Eight arrested in Malaysia over suspected terror links,"Malaysian police have arrested eight men for suspected terror links and extremist activities that threaten national security. The suspects - seven foreigners and a Malaysian - were detained by the Bukit Aman Special Branch Counter Terrorism Division in Kuala Lumpur, Perlis and Johor on Sept 24, national police chief Mohamad Fuzi Harun said in a statement yesterday. Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi said the suspects were involved with an Islamic learning centre in Perlis believed to be promoting extremist teachings. ""The arrests were made following intelligence obtained by police that a terrorist group based on the ideology of Salafi Jihadism in Yemen was planning to set up an Islamic learning centre in South-east Asia to spread the teachings of Salafi Jihadism,"" he added. Early investigations by police and shared intelligence from foreign agencies revealed that the centre's foreign teachers and students are linked to a madrasah in Dammaj, Yemen, founded by Syeikh Muqbil bin Hadi Al Wadi'i, a Salafi Jihadism leader and an extremist. The madrasah follows Salafi Jihadism teachings that allow the killing of non-Muslims and Muslims who do not prescribe to their philosophy. They also label the democratic system as un-Islamic. It was learnt from the arrested suspects that they believe in extremist teachings, such as banning men and women from wearing trousers. Work is also not allowed as this results in men and women being together, and Muslims who do so are labelled apostates. The first arrests in Perlis involved five Europeans and a sixth suspect from the American continent, all aged between 24 and 38 years old and students at the Perlis centre. One of those arrested was related to a citizen of a neighbouring country linked to the Syeikh Muqbil madrasah and who has also undergone weapons training. Intelligence from a foreign agency revealed that all six are linked to the Daesh terrorist group, also known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), or other extremist organisations. The seventh arrest, which occurred in Kuala Lumpur, involved a 33-year-old suspect from the Middle East who was a teacher at the Perlis centre. The suspect was conducting classes to spread Salafi Jihadism teachings in Klang Valley. Police in Johor arrested a 32-year-old Malaysian who was a student at the Perlis centre in 2014. ""The arrests... are to curb the spread of Salafi Jihadism ideology, which is the basis for violent acts by groups such as the Islamic State, Al-Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiah (JI), Abu Sayyaf, Boko Haram and others,"" said Mr Mohamad Fuzi. ""This is not the first time that foreign Salafi Jihadism elements are using Malaysia as a base to spread their ideology and recruit new members."" He added that JI leaders Abdullah Sungkar and Abu Bakar Bashir infiltrated Malaysia in 1985 for the same purpose. Malaysia has arrested around 400 people since 2013 for suspected links to terrorism. In 2016, police arrested 115 individuals in the country with links to terrorist groups. There were 82 arrests in 2015, 59 in 2014 and four in 2013."
Sweden killer claims truck rampage for IS ‘caliphate’,"STOCKHOLM, Feb 21 — An Uzbek asylum seeker who mowed down shoppers in a truck claimed at his trial Tuesday that he killed them in the service of the Islamic State group — but his accusers insisted he acted alone. Rakhmat Akilov, 40, is on trial on terrorism charges for the rampage on a busy shopping street in Stockholm, in which he killed five people and injured 10 more in April last year. He has admitted carrying out the attack and claims to have had the blessing of the Islamic State (IS) extremist group, but prosecutors do not believe that he had direct help. The method of the attack resembled other vehicle assaults in Europe in 2016, including Nice in France and Berlin — but unlike those attacks, the Stockholm killings were never claimed by IS. IS proclaimed an Islamic “caliphate” in parts of Syria and Iraq but has been largely crushed by US-backed coalition forces over recent months. Akilov pledged allegiance to the group and told the court that he had been given the green light by IS members on encrypted chat sites. He claims he was unable to identify them. Investigations have failed to conclude whether he received any financial or material assistance. Chief prosecutor Hans Ihrman said Akilov “sought support” from outside contacts but they did not have a “decisive” role in the attack. “Akilov had planned and prepared the attack on his own” and “wasn’t dependent on other people,” Ihrman told reporters after the hearing. Akilov told the court he wanted “Sweden to end its participation in the fight against the caliphate, to stop sending its soldiers to war zones.” Sweden has around 70 military personnel based mainly in northern Iraq to provide training as part of the US-led coalition against IS. In the attack, Akilov stole a beer truck and crashed it into a store. Three Swedes were killed including an 11-year-old girl, as well as a British man of 41 and a Belgian woman of 31. Ten other people were injured. Akilov then set off an explosive device but it did not blow up as planned and caused damage only to the truck. Akilov fled the scene, running into a nearby metro station, and was arrested several hours later after being identified from security cameras. He told police he wanted “to die as a martyr in an explosion”. Speaking calmly in Russian through an interpreter, Akilov expressed no remorse for his actions. Cooperative at the beginning of questioning, he gradually grew impatient. “From his testimony so far, it’s quite obvious that we are dealing with a person who is quite convinced of the splendour of his deed,” a lawyer for 13 of the plaintiffs, Gustaf Linderholm, told AFP. After arriving in Sweden in 2014, at the start of a wave of migration to Europe, Akilov’s application for residency was rejected in June 2016. He later went on the run to avoid expulsion and worked odd jobs in construction. The father of four drank alcohol and used drugs, according to colleagues and acquaintances. He lived alone in Sweden while his wife and children stayed behind in Uzbekistan. Prosecutors have said they will seek a life sentence and afterwards his expulsion. A life sentence in Sweden varies, but is on average 16 years. The trial is scheduled to last through May, with a verdict due in June. "
More bombs fall on Syria’s Ghouta after heaviest toll in years,"BEIRUT, Feb 20 — Pro-government forces bombarded Syria’s eastern Ghouta today, killing at least 49 people, after the heaviest one-day death toll there in three years on Monday, a war monitoring group said. Some 127 people were killed in air raids, rocket strikes and shelling of the area near Damascus yesterday, according to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. About 190 have died since the bombing intensified late on Sunday and 850 have been injured, it said. The United Nations called for an immediate ceasefire in the area on Monday, saying the situation was “spiralling out of control” after an “extreme escalation in hostilities”. The Union of Medical Care and Relief Organisations, a coalition of international agencies that funds hospitals in Syria, said bombs had hit five hospitals in eastern Ghouta on Monday. In Geneva, the UN children’s fund issued a blank “statement” to express its outrage at the casualties among Syrian children, saying it had run out of words. The violence in eastern Ghouta is part of a wider escalation in fighting on several fronts in Syria as President Bashar al-Assad pushes to end the seven-year rebellion against him. Mortars fired by rebels in eastern Ghouta landed in Damascus today, causing two deaths and several injuries, Syrian state media reported. At least one person died from rebel mortar fire in the capital yesterday. Lebanon’s al-Manar television, which is aligned with Assad’s ally Hezbollah, reported yesterday that the Syrian army was sending reinforcements towards eastern Ghouta after rebel assaults. Assad’s most powerful supporter, Russia, has been following a diplomatic track at the same time as the increase in fighting, resulting in the establishment of several “de-escalation zones”. Eastern Ghouta is in one of these areas, where violence is meant to be contained, but the de-escalation agreement does not include a former al Qaeda affiliate which has a small presence there. Other insurgent groups in eastern Ghouta, including Islamist factions, say the Syrian government and Russia are using the jihadist presence as a pretext to continue their bombardment. Neither the Syrian military nor Russia commented on the renewed bombardment in eastern Ghouta, but they have often said they do not target civilians. The Observatory said the intensified bombing was in preparation for a pro-government ground offensive against the enclave and that a rebel group there had foiled an attempt by Syria’s army to advance overnight."
Report: Foreign terrorists acquiring Malaysian IDs for as little as RM350," KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 17 ? Foreign terrorists are among those who are acquiring Malaysian identification documents for just RM350, which in turn is enabling them to find jobs in the country, according to a report. New Straits Times said that some of these individuals, who are from the Philippines, have gone on to secure jobs as security guards in the country. It said that counterterrorism operatives had arrested at least two individuals from the Phillippines who had assumed fake identities and even gained employment as a result. They bought their IDs, a fake MyKad, for RM1,000 and RM350 respectively. “The availability of fake Malaysian identification documents is worrying, especially when we don’t know who bought them and where they are,” the report quoted an enforcement agency official as saying. Southeast Asia regional director for International Association for Counterterrorism and Security Professionals, Andrin Raj, said that Malaysia has become a centre for fake documentation in Southeast Asia. “Terrorist groups, such as al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiah, in the past had established Malaysia as the ‘centre’ for securing fake documentation in Southeast Asia,” he reportedly said."
 New York bomber sentenced to life in prison," US restaurant worker inspired by Osama bin Laden was sentenced to life in prison Tuesday for wounding 31 people in a 2016 New York bombing, branded ""extremely dangerous"" by a federal judge. Afghan-born Ahmad Khan Rahimi, 30, told the court that he became radicalized after being ""harassed"" by the FBI and ""singled out"" for his religion, but showed no remorse for inflicting the bloody injuries. Prosecutors told his two-week trial last year it was a ""miracle"" that nobody was killed in the September 17, 2016 attack. A second bomb forced the cancellation of a US Marine Corps run in the New Jersey town of Seaside Park. He was convicted on all eight counts. Police also defused another device in Chelsea and found additional pipe bombs in Rahimi's hometown of Elizabeth, New Jersey, where he worked in his family's fried chicken restaurant. Rahimi was critically wounded in a shootout with police on September 19 before being captured, and was found with a handwritten journal lauding Osama bin Laden and US-born Al-Qaeda recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki. He moved to the United States in 1995 with his family and became a naturalized citizen in 2011. Addressing the court at length, Rahimi said he understood why there were frustrations between Muslim countries and Americans. ""I have been here for more than 20 years, I had American friends and Muslim friends,"" he said. Things started to change, he said, after he started acting and dressing like a devout Muslim. ""I was harassed by the FBI,"" he said, referring to going on holiday to the Dominican Republic. He claimed he was ""singled out just because of my attire"" after returning from a trip to Pakistan. ""I was never discriminated for my religion until I started following it,"" he said. Rahimi's father contacted the FBI in the months leading up to the attack, warning them about his son's militant sympathies. ""I did not hear an ounce of justification,"" US District Judge Richard Berman. ""There is no comparison between the grievances that you may feel and the actions you took... The conclusion is inescapable that you remain extremely dangerous,"" the judge added. ""Innocent people on a Saturday night, it is inexplicable that anybody would do that deliberately. But you did. It was you."" Since Rahimi's arrest, two other lone-wolf attackers have carried out bombings in New York. A Bangladeshi driver detonated a bomb in a subway passageway, wounding himself and three other people in December. On October 31, an Uzbek immigrant, also reportedly inspired by the Islamic State extremist group, killed eight people on a bike path by ramming his truck into cyclists. New York retains stringent security, which was drastically stepped up after the September 11, 2001 Al-Qaeda hijackings brought down the Twin Towers."
 Report: Terrorist from Philippines bought MyKad for RM350,"KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 12 — The availability of forged Malaysian identification papers have raised concerns that high risk elements like terrorists could leverage on them to infiltrate the country and remained undetected, New Straits Times (NST) reported today. Suspected Islamic State terrorists from the Philippines were reported to have easily secured falsified MyKads for prices ranging from RM1,000 to as low as RM350. This had made it easier for them to register for mobile telecommunications services and get jobs. “One, who police identified as Dahwan, 22, was employed in Cheras. He bought the illicitly reproduced MyKad in Sabah for RM1,000 suspects holding such documents also face no problems registering for mobile phone numbers with local telecommunications companies,” the report said. Another Filipino identified as Nurhan Sahi Hakim, 33, also gained employment in the country by assuming the identity of one “Yusof Attang”. He had been was arrested by counterterrorism operatives. “Nurhan, who had been charged over the alleged offence, admitted that he bought the fake MyKad for only RM350,” the report said. Southeast Asia regional director for the International Association for Counterterrorism and Security Professionals, Andrin Raj, in response to the information said the existence of foreigners with fake Malaysian identification documents posed serious threats to national security, a concern NST reported were echoed by counterterror operatives here. “Terrorist groups, such as al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiah, in the past had established Malaysia as the ‘centre’ for securing fake documentation in Southeast Asia,” said Andrin. NST also quoted an unnamed source in an enforcement agency as saying that several foreign terrorist fighters had penetrated the nation’s borders under the guise of someone else. “The availability of fake Malaysian identification documents is worrying, especially when we don’t know who bought them and where they are. “The worry is these people could make their way to sensitive areas,” the source said. Corruption is likely a major factor allowing for identification documents forgery, that means investigation into the matter must go beyond arresting terrorists and target all links to transnational criminal group and corrupt public agencies. “About 15 years ago, when I was working for the Finland embassy, an African came to apply for a visa..I was asked to verify his visa approval from Malaysia. We found a fake approval stamp on his passport,” Adrin said. “There was also a case where an Afghan man entered Malaysia using a fake Spanish passport. He walked through the Immigration passport control with ease. “He bought the passport for US$10,000 (RM39,399) and even knew which passport control line to walk through in Pakistan and Malaysia.”"
Kidnapped mayor of northern Mali town freed,"BAMAKO, Feb 12 — A mayor in northern Mali known for serving as a mediator for Western hostages said yesterday he has been freed after being held captive for around three weeks. “All I can say for now is that I am free,” Tarkint mayor Baba Ould Cheikh told AFP by telephone. A relative confirmed the release, telling AFP he had seen Cheikh earlier in the day, adding that his abduction by six gunmen sometime between January 21 and 23 had been due to “a private matter”. A security source said at the time that the abduction was carried out either “by people he had a disagreement with, or Islamists”. Mali’s government signed a peace agreement with coalitions of non-jihadist armed groups in the north in June 2015. But Islamist insurgents remain active, and large tracts of the former French colony are lawless. The mayor had been named in an enquiry into a drug-smuggling operation in 2009 involving a Boeing 727 flown from Venezuela and burnt after unloading the cargo in the northern Gao region, according to the UN drugs agency. He was arrested for cocaine trafficking in April 2013 but released months later due to lack of evidence. Islamist extremists linked to Al-Qaeda took control of Mali’s desert north in early 2012, but were largely driven out in an ongoing French-led military operation launched in January 2013. "
"Syria raids kill nearly 30, as war of words escalates over chlorine use","Syria raids kill nearly 30, as war of words escalates over chlorine use Regime bombardment killed nearly 30 people in a rebel enclave near Damascus on Monday, as Syria’s seven-year conflict left civilians paying a heavy price. Residents across several Syrian battlefronts have reported escalating bombardment and have accused Syrian troops of deploying toxic chemicals against rebel-held zones. In nearby Zamalka, another devastated Eastern Ghouta town, a man could be seen carrying the body of his child, wrapped in a blood-soaked white sheet, through the streets. (AFP/ Amer ALMOHIBANY/ Manila Bulletin) The United States on Monday said there was “obvious evidence” of multiple chlorine gas attacks in recent weeks, including in the opposition-held enclave of Eastern Ghouta near Damascus. On Monday, dozens of air strikes and artillery fire battered Eastern Ghouta, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. “Twenty-nine civilians were killed and dozens were wounded,” said the war monitor’s head, Rami Abdel Rahman. The deadliest raids on Monday hit a market in the town of Beit Sawa, killing 10 civilians including two children. Another nine civilians, two of them children and one a local rescue worker, were killed in Arbin. Eastern Ghouta is included in a de-escalation deal agreed last year by rebel ally Turkey and government supporters Iran and Russia. But violence has ramped up there in recent weeks, and this month alone, chlorine is suspected of having been used on two occasions in munitions launched by the regime on Eastern Ghouta. A third accusation of toxic gas use came from Idlib, an opposition-controlled province in the country’s northwest that also falls in a de-escalation zone. Nearly a dozen people were treated for breathing difficulties on Sunday after Syrian government raids on the town of Saraqeb, the Observatory said. Mohammad Ghaleb Tannari, a doctor in a nearby town, said his hospital had treated 11 people. The US proposed a draft statement condemning the use of chemicals as a weapon, but Syrian government ally Russia added amendments that made no mention of the attack, according to a draft seen by AFP. In the end no statement was adopted. US ambassador Nikki Haley slammed Russia for balking at a statement that she described as a “simple condemnation of Syrian children being suffocated by chlorine gas”. But Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia hit back. “It’s completely clear to us the goal is to basically accuse the Syrian government of chemical weapons use where no perpetrators have been identified,” he said. The UN has found that Syria’s government carried out chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015, and also used sarin against a town in Idlib last year. Syria’s government has vehemently denied ever deploying chemical weapons in the country’s seven-year war. More than 340,000 people have been killed in Syria’s conflict, which began with anti-government protests but morphed into an ugly civil war. Thousands of children are among the victims, and the UN’s children agency on Monday decried yet another bloody month for Syria’s children. UNICEF said at least 83 children were killed in conflicts across the Middle East in January, including 59 in Syria alone. In apparent retaliation for Monday’s bombardment, rockets and mortars rained down on government-controlled districts of Damascus, Syria’s state news agency SANA reported. One woman was killed and four people were wounded in mortar fire on the Bab Touma neighbourhood and the capital’s Mariamite Cathedral, a Greek Orthodox church, a police source told the agency. Another person was killed in rocket fire on the regime-held part of Harasta district. Also on Monday, two Canadian citizens who were being held by jihadist factions in the country’s northwest were released to Turkish authorities. Jolly Bimbachi and Sean Moore had crossed into Syria in December 2017 from Lebanon, where Bimbachi was fighting a custody battle for her two sons, she told AFP. They were picked up by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an alliance dominated by Al-Qaeda’s former Syrian affiliate, and handed over to a civilian authority. “They’re going to take us into Turkey, and in Turkey we are going to meet someone from the Canadian embassy,” Bimbachi said."
Tears fall as Maranaos remember Marawi siege,"MARAWI CITY – A year after the breakout of the siege that left this city in heaps of debris and scrap metal, Maranaos on Wednesday gathered in a gymnasium at the provincial capitol to pray and remember the lives lost during the 5-month war in their beloved hometown. During the prayer, 36-year-old Norma Romoro could not help but shed tears as she remembered her elder brother who died after being trapped in Barangay Dansalan, one of the 24 worst hit barangays, in the peak of the firefights between Maute terrorists and government troops. ""Kung hindi siya namatay, ngayon karamay ko pa rin sana siya,"" she told ABS-CBN News, still trying to control her emotions. Apart from her brother, the family also lost their home where she and her sibling had grown up. They are now among the thousands of bakwits (evacuees) waiting for government's plan to help them recover. Romoro shared that she was pregnant when the war broke out on the 23rd of May last year. While rushing out of Marawi, her water broke earlier than scheduled, giving birth to her son, a new source of hope while they lived the temporary lives of bakwits. Jalilah Palala, meanwhile, also shed tears as she prayed for the coming years of her life as an evacuee. She and her family used to live a decent life as sari-sari store owners in Barangay Daguduban before the war in the lakeside city destroyed everything they had worked for. ""Hindi namin makalimutan 'yung nangyari sa amin. Marami sa amin ang hindi maka-move on sa nangyari,"" the mother of three told ABS-CBN News. ""Sana tulungan niya (President Rodrigo Duterte) kaming makabangon, sa pinansyal talaga—puhunan."" As displaced residents sobbed for their loss, Presidential Peace Adviser Jesus Dureza came to extend sympathies on behalf of President Rodrigo Duterte. Dureza, who recently spoke with Duterte, said the President has been planning to visit Marawi but the Chief Executive told him to just extend his sympathies to the Maranaos commemorating the first year of the start of the siege.. ""Nag-extend (ng sympathies) siya dahil plano niya talaga pumunta rito. But he said 'please extend my greetings to them and I'm one [with] them in commemoration [of] what happened,'"" Dureza said in an ambush interview. Special Assistant to the President Christopher Go earlier said Duterte believes the commemoration of the Marawi siege should be in October, when the southern Philippine city was liberated from the clutches of terrorists. Wednesday's prayer gathering was the culmination of the ""week of peace,"" a series of activities initiated by Task Force Bangon Marawi to commemorate the first anniversary of the breakout of the siege. In these events, the task force wanted to emphasize the importance of peace in the community. As early as November last year, residents who lived in barangays outside the most affected areas have started to go home only to find their houses in utter disarray and their hard-earned possessions looted—by terrorists or others, they are uncertain. Meanwhile, thousands of families who hail from 24 barangays that saw the most destruction are still staying in different evacuation centers and temporary shelters as they wait for at least three years for the government to fully rebuild the war-ravaged portion of the city. May they be in tent cities or in temporary shelters, the bakwits all have the same plea— water, cash assistance, a clear plan for the displaced, and the fast-tracking of Marawi's rehabilitation. Some Maranao groups have slammed the government for not including them in the rebuilding plan. They said their proposals, like the scrapping of the proposed military camp in the city, among others, have not been included in what has been presented to them so far. Task Force Bangon Marawi earlier announced that it is in talks with a China-led consortium about the reconstruction of the once-bustling city. The government vowed to speed up their efforts but also appealed for patience among the evacuees. ""You cannot rebuild overnight,"" said Dureza, hoping the displaced residents would understand that the government is doing its best. Around a thousand people, including soldiers, terrorists, and civilians were killed in the 5-month Marawi siege last year. The war between the Islamic State-inspired terrorists and government troops began on May 23, 2017, when authorities attempted to arrest wanted terrorist leader Isnilon Hapilon."
Suspected Iraqi terrorist nabbed in Pampanga," Dela Rosa says they have not established evidence to implicate the Iraqi national as a suspected terrorist. He adds his entry to the Philippines was during the height of the Marawi siege and ASEAN Summit. @ABSCBNNews pic.twitter.com/i9Mgp1x4xG — Bianca Dava (@biancadava) January 22, 2018 The Iraqi embassy previously alerted the Philippines about the suspect who is allegedly working for the Hamas militant extremist group. According to Dela Rosa, the suspect came to the Philippines in August 2017 during the ASEAN Summit and the Marawi siege. Authorities have yet to determine the suspect's reason for travelling to Manila. Dela Rosa said the suspected terrorist will be deported back to Iraq as he is already overstaying in the country."
"Hearings into Marawi siege cause, rehabilitation sought","MANILA, Philippines — An opposition senator is seeking a Senate investigation into the status of rehabilitation efforts in the war-ravaged Marawi City and the circumstances that led to the longest military battle in the country’s history. Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV filed Senate Resolutions 742 and 743 as the Philippines on Wednesday marks a year since the siege that destroyed much of Marawi’s central business district and displaced 250,000 of its residents. “A year after the Marawi siege, the government has yet to present a comprehensive plan on how it intends to rehabilitate the city and assist our kababayans (fellow Filipinos) there,” the senator said. “Worse, its efforts are hampered by a number of issues, from questionable contractors that would rebuild the city, to displacement or land grabbing fears of the affected residents,” he added. Panel asked to check rehabilitation Under Resolution 742, Trillanes is asking the Senate Special Committee on Marawi City Rehabilitation, which was created to monitor the progress of rehabilitation efforts in the town, to probe into the status of reconstruction plans, relief and reconstruction of the city especially the livelihood of the displaced residents. Under the government’s master plan for Marawi rehabilitation, a total of 892 projects were pledged to be rolled out and completed just before President Rodrigo Duterte steps down from office in 2022. However, this master plan is yet to be finalized and framed in loose procurement rules and legal shortcuts, according to an analysis by the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism. PCIJ said that some of the problems rebuilding efforts faced were loopholes in the guidelines on project contract awarding, on-off and token consultations with affected communities, disjointed work by local and national agencies, unsettled land rights and reparation claims and many others. An organization of Marawi evacuees also hit the government for its plans to convert the city to a military reserve and an ecozone. However, Eduardo Del Rosario, the chairman of the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council, already clarified last month that the suggestion from Philippine Economic Zone Authority chief Jane Plaza to build an economic zone was just an offer and would not be imposed on anyone. Trillanes is also seeking a congressional probe, through the Senate Committee on National Defense and Security, into the circumstances that led to the battle for Marawi to avoid a similar conflict from arising in the future. “Months before the siege, the government knew about the impending crisis. Duterte even challanged the Maute group to burn Marawi. Despite this, the government was not able to prevent the conflict,” Trillanes, former military officer, said. Compensation for displaced sought Sen. Paolo Benigno “Bam” Aquino IV meanwhile is seeking monetary compensation for the affected residents of Marawi City who lost their homes and property during the five-month battle. In his Senate Bill 1816, Aquino said that the remuneration would help the residents to recover from the damage and destruction in their homes and property. “The residents immediately need help from the government for them to recover and return to their normal lives,” Aquino, a member of the Senate panel on Marawi rehabilitation, said in Filipino. The battle for Marawi started on May 23, 2017 after Islamic State-inspired militants from the Maute group tried to take over the city and make it the capital of the province of IS in Southeast Asia. Philippine security personnel and the militants battled for five months, leaving the city in shambles. According to the National Economic Development Authority, more than P50 billion is needed to rehabilitate the lakeside town. Del Rosario meanwhile gave a highter figure last month, saying that the price tag for the efforts will be at least P72 billion. "
PH welcomes designation of Maute group as terrorist organization,"MANILA (UPDATE) - The Philippines on Wednesday welcomed the U.S. Treasury Department's move to include the Maute group on its sanctions list for global terrorism.   ""The Philippine welcomes the US designation of ISIS Philippines and Maute group as foreign terrorist organizations and specially designating global terrorists,"" Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Ernesto Abella said. ""Cooperation with key allies is critical in averting terrorist operations,"" he said. Malacañang meanwhile said Washington's move affirms Manila's belief that the Maute group is composed of local terrorists aided by foreign extremists. ""This likewise recognizes the decisive action we have taken in liberating Marawi from these terrorists, which resulted in the success of the government in thwarting the establishment of an Islamic caliphate in the area and the containing of the rebellion from spreading to other parts of the Philippines,"" Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in a statement Wednesday. The ISIS-inspired Maute group was behind the 5-month siege of Marawi City that ended last October 23, 2017. The fierce battles between government forces and Maute terrorists left a thousand people dead and displaced over 350,000 residents from the city and nearby towns."
Military checking on reported terrorist infiltration in Mindanao waters,"MANILA - The military on Tuesday said it is validating reports that 40 terrorists were able to infiltrate the waters off Southern Philippines. ""We're still closely monitoring. Napakalaki ng ating coastal waters, vast and porous itong ating area. But our forces in Western Mindanao, the Western Mindanao Command and the 1st Infantry Division are closely guarding our coastal waters, southern borders, and these are things that we are closely working [on], together with the Philippine National Police, Philippine Coast Guard,"" said Brig. Gen. Bienvenido Datuin, Commanding-General of the AFP Civil Relations Service. ""...[W]e have established conventions, established agreements, bilateral, bilateral joint patrols with Malaysia, Indonesia, just to secure our waters,"" he said. Philippine National Police chief Director General Ronald Dela Rosa had told reporters Monday that terrorists were able to enter the waters off Mindanao. Dela Rosa gave no further details on the alleged infiltration, on who the terrorists are, their affiliation, and nationalities possibly involved. Mindanao is proximate to coasts of Indonesia and Malaysia. Datuin said nothing is confirmed yet from the military side and that they are still awaiting reports from ground units. Asked if he is aware of reports that recruitment is still on for the Maute group, the Islamic State-linked terror group behind the five-month siege of Marawi City last year, Datuin said the military is still studying the reported recruitment pattern. He added that troops are still on their toes, keeping watch to prevent violent extremism. ""We are studying recruitment patterns and styles, psychology of violent extremism and programs to avoid a repeat of Marawi,"" said Datuin."
Marawi siege was really a prolonged war',"MANILA- The biggest security crisis to hit the Philippines in 2017 was ""really a prolonged war,"" Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) Assemblyman Zia Alonto Adiong said on Tuesday. Looking back at the bloodshed that claimed over 1,000 lives and forced hundreds of thousands to flee, Adiong said no one thought that the siege would even last for a week, much more 5 months. ""It was really a prolonged war. Nobody was expecting that it would drag on for 5 months...Nobody really expected that the war would go on for even about a week much less 2 weeks,"" he said on ANC's Beyond Politics. On May 23, 2017, Islamic State-inspired extremists laid siege on Marawi City prompting President Rodrigo Duterte to place the entire island of Mindanao under martial law. The war dragged on for months until government troops killed the terrorists' leaders in October. Adiong said it was only later on in the crisis when local officials began to realize how radical ideologies have been quietly spreading across Mindanao, and lamented how little has been done to counter such narratives. ""They (terrorists) have been using experiences of inequality as a common experience among different Muslim countries across the world [in recruiting],"" he said, noting that the Maute group had been searching for members as early as 2011. Adiong conceded that the war was really ""well-planned and well-organized"" for a local terrorist group such as the Maute. Asked on his views on what went wrong in terms of security, Adiong said it is better to focus instead on rebuilding Marawi City rather than point fingers. ""We cannot dwell on the past. Let's move forward. This is a big lesson for our country,"" he said. ""Our focus right now is moving forward. It has already happened, the destruction is already there. We really have to channel our energy towards the rehabilitation of Marawi,"" he added."
Sri Mulyani says terrorist attacks 'will not affect investment',"Finance Minister Sri Mulyani has expressed confidence that the recent bombings on churches in Surabaya will not deter investors from investing in the country as the law enforcers have started to seriously deal with the issue. “We hope that law enforcement will restore perception and trust in Indonesia,” said Sri Mulyani over the weekend in Jakarta as reported tribunnews.com Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (Indef) economist Bima Yudhistira made a similar comment, saying that the sooner law enforcement officers could arrest the suspects, the better it would be for the investment climate. Suicide bombers attacked three churches in Surabaya on Sunday, killing 14 people and wounding at least 41 others. The attacks occurred days after the riot and prison siege at the National Police's Mobile Brigade headquarters (Mako Brimob) detention center in Depok, West Java last week, in which five police officers and one detainee were killed. “But if the incident is not handled properly by law enforcement, it may affect negatively [on investor confidence],” Bima said in Jakarta on Sunday  as reported by kompas.com. Bima added that security was one of the key considerations among investors, but that the fatal Mako Brimob riot had insignificant impact, with the rupiah even strengthening to Rp 13,900 against US dollar from Rp 14,000 earlier last week. “It means that investors might be taking [the incident] into consideration, but they are taking the global economy into greater consideration, particularly the United States’ economic policy,” said Bima, adding that investors would also be watching Bank Indonesia’s decision on its reference rate.

"Possible remnants of Maute, terrorist groups still recruiting — Bautista","Philippine Army chief Lt. Gen. Rolando Bautista has confirmed that possible remnants and supporters of the Maute Group and other local terrorist groups continuously recruit for new members to launch a future attack similar to what happened to Marawi City last year. Bautista made the revelation in an interview during the Army-Media Fellowship Night held at the Army headquarters in Fort Bonifacio, Makati City on Friday night. He said they continue to get numerous information that the recruitment continues and that foreign fighters have also arrived to join their local counterparts. “Actually expected iyun ano (we already expected that). In fact after the Marawi liberation again its common action that supporters who are inside, the enemy whom we already neutralized and we have received reports that the recruitment is not limited within Lanao del Sur,” Bautista said. “But it also continued in the area of Basilan, Sulu and even in the area of Palimbang,” he added. Bautista said if one will observe prior to the Marawi siege, different terrorist groups united under the leadership of the late Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon to establish a caliphate state in Southeast Asia. “And we all know that they have support coming from the different leaderships particularly in Indonesia and Malaysia and there were reports which are still being validated that they entered through the southern backdoor and even in Metro Manila there are but we were able to identify them and at the same time actions were taken by the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the concentration right now is in Central Mindanao,” Bautista said. He said if one will talk of Central Mindanao or local terrorist group in Central Mindanao, the BIFF or the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters comes to mind. “Some local terrorist groups will unite with the BIFF as the area in Central Mindanao besides sa hindi masyado yung sundalo (there are less soldiers) and their movement in the area is malaki (big) so they take advantage of that,” Bautista said. Bautista said the recruitment and threat continues and the possibility that terrorists will occupy or lay siege to another city is there. “There is a threat, the recruitment continues so meaningful to say if the recruitment continues there is still a possibility that they will lay siege or occupy another city, not particularly Marawi City. That is a big possibility that is why the rehabilitation of Marawi City continuous,” he said. Bautista said part of the recruitment is how they see the progress of the rehabilitation of Marawi will develop in the coming months."
Suspected Pakistani terrorist denied entry anew,"MANILA, Philippines — The Bureau of Immigration (BI) has barred a Pakistani man, believed to be an Islamic State (IS) trainer, from entering the country for the second time. Naeem Hussain, 36, was intercepted by BI agents at the Clark International Airport in Pampanga on Sept. 22, Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente confirmed yesterday. Hussain had arrived on an Emirates Airlines flight from Dubai, according to Morente. BI officer-in-charge Deputy Commissioner Marc Red Mariñas said this was the second attempt of Hussain to enter the Philippines. BI records showed that the suspected terrorist was first intercepted at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport last May. “He was turned away because he is on our alert list of suspected international terrorists for being an alleged trainer of Daesh,” Morente said. Hussain was immediately excluded and booked on the first available flight to his country of origin. Daesh is also known as IS or Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Its members have been waging war against the United States and its coalition partners in Iraq and Syria, where the terrorist group wants to establish an Islamic caliphate. Hussain was on the watchlist of the military, which sought the BI’s help in monitoring the Pakistani’s possible entry into the country. During questioning, Hussain claimed that he has been working as a digital designer. He said he traveled to the Philippines to visit his Filipina girlfriend, who lives in Olongapo City. 30-day detention for terror suspects backed Senators are supporting the proposal of security officials to extend to 30 days the detention of terror suspects arrested without warrants and other amendments under a strengthened Human Security Act (HSA). Security and military officials made their pitch to amend the HSA during the Senate hearing on various bills, which seek to strengthen the 11-year-old anti-terrorism law jointly held by the committees on public order and dangerous drugs; national defense and security; justice and human rights, and finance. Sen. Panfilo Lacson, who chairs the public order committee, described the HSA as “a dead-letter law” and the “weakest” of its kind in the region. “For one, no person or organization has ever been prosecuted under the HSA in the past 11 years. In fact, what may be considered the first and only implementation of that act was the proscription of the Abu Sayyaf as a terrorist organization by the regional trial court in Isabela City, Basilan,” he said. Lacson cited the case of Australia, which has enacted 61 anti-terror measures since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the US, to keep up with the growing sophistication of terror threats. He said the country should learn its lesson from the Marawi siege. He added that martial law currently imposed over Mindanao is practically toothless. Under the anti-terrorism law, suspects may “not be detained for more than three days without the written approval of a municipal, city, provincial or regional official of a Human Rights Commission or judge of the municipal, regional trial court, the Sandiganbayan or a justice of the Court of Appeals nearest the place of the arrest.” – With Paolo Romero "
