# Terrorism-News-Classifier-FYP
This is my Final Year Project where I have to make a research on which Machine Learning algorithm is the best on classifying terrorism news and also observe how K-means cluster the terrorism news on how each cluster has its own topic.

## Objectives
This research aims to develop a classification system to classify terrorism news from other news. The project objectives are:
- To study classification and clustering algorithm for news classification
- To develop a classification model for terrorism news
- To evaluate the classification model
