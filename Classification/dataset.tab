"Couple held in waterboarding of girl, 9, police say"	"The father and stepmother of a 9-year-old girl have been arrested on child abuse charges after being accused of using waterboarding as a form of punishment, according to a report. Authorities identified the suspects as Joseph Maeser Mitchell, 29, and Ilaria Catherina Mitchell, 28, of Provo, Utah, Salt Lake City’s FOX 13 reported. The girl told police that the couple punished her on three occasions by tying her hands behind her back, then holding her down in a bathtub, with a towel over her face, as they ran water over her face, the report said. “The 9-year-old stated that she cannot breathe and it hurts when this happens,” a police report states, according to FOX 13. Reached in Texas, the girl’s biological mother expressed shock and outrage after hearing the allegations, the station reported. “It was the hardest thing for me to hear having to be in Texas,” said Brittany Calabrese, who added she hasn’t seen her daughter since 2014. “She’s nine, nine years old. That is torture of a child.” The case came to the attention of authorities in November when the father brought the girl to Utah Valley Hospital for an unspecified reason, and nurses making inquiries determined that something seemed wrong. The child is currently in the custody of the state’s Division of Child and Family Services while the case is handled by the legal system, FOX 13 reported."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Indiana governor says passing hate crime law 'long overdue'	"The spray-painting of a swastika outside a suburban Indianapolis synagogue this summer was the final straw for Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb, who quickly called for Indiana to join the 45 states that have hate crime laws. ""It's not only the right thing to do, it's long overdue,"" Holcomb said Friday during an interview with The Associated Press. ""I'm convinced the overwhelming majority of Hoosiers feel the same way."" As the annual legislative session draws near, though, some warn that such a proposal could spark a bitter cultural debate that would bring unwanted attention to the deeply conservative state, much like the 2015 religious objections law that critics widely panned as a sanctioning of discrimination against the LGBT community and that drew a stiff rebuke from big business. ""If this is a big, knock-down, drag out, 'RFRA-esque' discussion, it is not going to help anyone,"" said House Speaker Brian Bosma, using an acronym for 2015's Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which was signed into law by Vice President Mike Pence when he was Indiana governor. ""We need to do it in such a way that's not a net negative and brings undue attention to our state."" Bosma would know. The Indianapolis Republican helped shepherd a bill to ""fix"" the law through the Statehouse — steps that were taken only after businesses protested, groups vowed a boycott and the state was lampooned on late-night TV. An overwhelming majority of states have hate crime laws, which vary to some degree but generally allow for stiffer sentences to be given to people who are convicted of crimes motivated by hatred or bias. Only Indiana, Georgia, South Carolina, Wyoming and Arkansas do not. What remains to be seen is what sort of law might be palatable to Indiana legislators — whether it would be open-ended and general or whether it would specify characteristics that would be covered, such as race, gender, religion, sexual orientation and gender identity, which is what Holcomb wants. While many business leaders support the governor's call for a hate crime law and view the absence of one as a sign of intolerance, many religious conservatives, including some rank-and-file legislators, see it as an unnecessary exercise that could lead to other unwanted social changes. For years, they've stymied efforts to put a hate crime law on the books, arguing that judges can already consider factors such as bias when determining sentences. ""Nobody is for hate crime, but it's a Pandora's box,"" said Ron Johnson, who leads the Indiana Pastors Alliance and believes Christians are persecuted by gay rights supporters. ""It opens the door to all the rest of this craziness that we are seeing."" Some conservatives argue that adopting a hate crime law would create a ""protected"" class of citizen and grant additional acceptance to those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. Another common refrain among lawmakers who oppose the idea is that it would target ""thought crime."" All crimes are bad, they say, regardless of what motivates them. Holcomb says ""nothing could be further from the truth."" ""You want to have a moronic thought ... that's your right,"" he said. ""But when it becomes a criminal action, you've crossed the line."" For those who have received intimidating threats driven by hatred or bias, the issue is far less abstract than many critics portray. Across the U.S., the number of reported hate crimes increased by about 17 percent in 2017, according to the FBI. In Indiana, the number has fluctuated in recent decades, ranging from about 40 to over 100 crimes per year that would fit the description. But those figures depend on how law enforcement agencies categorize crime, which can be subjective, and how many of them report their statistics to the FBI, which can fluctuate. Indiana has a complicated history when it comes to prejudice and bigotry. The state was a stop along the Underground Railroad, but in the 1920s, local politics was dominated by the Ku Klux Klan, with some estimates indicating that one-quarter of the native-born white men were members. In the 1960s, Indiana-born author and diplomat John Bartlow Martin described the state in a memo to Robert Kennedy as ""suspicious of foreign entanglements, conservative in fiscal matters, and with a strong overlay of Southern segregationist sentiment,"" according to Indiana historian Ray Boomhower. Aside from the synagogue vandalism that prompted Holcomb to publicly call for a hate crime law, activists say graffiti swastikas have been appearing in more public places. Last year, a man pleaded guilty to battery after authorities say he attacked a woman in Bloomington while shouting racial slurs and trying to remove her headscarf. And Matthew Heimbach, of Paoli, has become a prominent figure in the white nationalist movement, once spearheading a group that described itself as ""fighting to secure the existence of our people and a future for white children."" David Sklar, assistant director of the Indianapolis Jewish Community Relations Council, said the only reason anyone should worry about a hate crime law ""is if you are a criminal."" ""Will passing a hate crime statute ultimately stop a hate crime from happening? Chances are probably not,"" Sklar said. ""But it is equally important to make sure that a person receives the right amount of jail time and for the state to say, 'We will not tolerate these things and we will make our laws reflect that.'"""	nonTerrorism	Crime
Family: Alabama tries to shield officer who killed black man	"Relatives of a black man killed by police in Alabama's largest shopping mall claimed Monday that a state takeover of the investigation is a bid by authorities to protect the officer. Holding a photo of her son Emantic ""EJ"" Bradford Jr., April Pipkins said the move by Attorney General Steve Marshall to assume control of the probe seemed aimed at shielding the officer, who has yet to be named publicly. The family's lawyers contend the case should have been left with newly elected Jefferson County District Attorney Danny Carr, who is black, or given to Lynneice Washington, another black district attorney who handles cases in the western part of the county. ""All the family wants is for justice to be served for my son,"" Pipkins said during a news conference. ""By taking the case from Mr. Carr, we feel they are trying to protect this officer who killed by son."" Carr declined comment, but his office reissued a statement from last week saying it was capable of handling the investigation into Bradford's death at a shopping mall in suburban Hoover on Thanksgiving night. Marshall said last week that his office was taking over the investigation to guard against any potential conflicts of interest involving local officials. Joy Patterson, spokeswoman for the attorney general's office, said Monday that correspondence shows Carr ""directly conveyed to Attorney General Marshall the presence of Carr's perceived conflicts in this matter"" and that Marshall ""acted on standard procedure to assume prosecution."" ""The Attorney General's Office will ensure that the Hoover mall shooting cases are handled with the highest degree of fairness and professionalism as we pursue justice for all parties,"" Patterson said. Washington said she doesn't believe Carr should have been removed from the case, and she doubts Marshall would now send the case to her. The officer who shot Bradford is involved in about 20 cases pending with area prosecutors, officials said. At least one protest leader involved in demonstrations over the shooting publicly supported Carr in his successful bid to become Birmingham's first black district attorney. Ben Crump, an attorney representing Bradford's family, said relatives were ""very suspicious"" of the grab by Marshall, a Republican appointee who won his first full term in office last month. The officer should be charged with murder if the evidence supports it, he said. ""They feel they're trying to protect this officer,"" Crump said. Bradford, 21, was shot to death moments after gunfire erupted during a confrontation at the Riverchase Galleria, which was crowded with holiday shoppers. Police initially claimed Bradford was the gunman in that initial confrontation and said an officer shot him. They later said Bradford was not the shooter but an officer heard shots, saw Bradford with a gun and fired at him. Relatives have said Bradford was licensed to carry a weapon. A forensic exam commissioned by the family showed that Bradford was shot three times in the rear portion of his body, including once in the back of the head. A brief portion of videotape reviewed by the family's legal team supports evidence that indicates Bradford was moving away from the officer when he was shot, Crump said. Authorities have refused to publicly release video or other evidence, citing the continuing investigation."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Georgia teacher admits stealing 9-year-old student's violin to pay ticket, police say"	"A Georgia teacher told police he stole a 9-year-old student's violin because he needed money to pay for a $700 ticket. Citing an incident report, news outlets report that video showed 21-year-old Kalif Jones of Stone Mountain stealing the instrument from the cafeteria. It also showed the Brockett Elementary School teacher walking throughout the school with the violin case in hand before leaving with it. The criminal investigation began in late November after the student came home without his instrument. Police arrested the Dekalb County teacher after he said he stole the violin because he had recently received a $700 ticket and needed money for it. Jail records show he was charged with a count of misdemeanor theft Nov. 29. It's unclear if he has a lawyer."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Statue of Liberty climber convicted in July 4 protest	"A woman who climbed the base of the Statue of Liberty on July 4 to protest the separation of families at the Mexican border was convicted Monday of misdemeanor charges by a judge who said a person's viewpoint can't be a factor in whether laws are enforced. The verdict by U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel W. Gorenstein came two hours after Therese Okoumou got choked up as she testified, saying images from the U.S.-Mexican border of children being torn from their parents gave her nightmares. She faces up to 18 months in prison at a March 5 sentencing on charges of trespassing, interference with an agency's function and disorderly conduct. Ron Kuby, one of Okoumou's lawyers, told the judge that his client wanted a trial even though it was clear the ""likelihood of her conviction today was close to 100 percent."" In a courtroom packed with emotional Okoumou supporters, Gorenstein explained that his decision needed to be consistent whether it was Okoumou who climbed the statue or somebody with the exact opposite opinions. He noted that Okoumou repeatedly ignored orders to descend from a perch at the feet of the statue that was high enough that a prosecutor said it could have seriously injured or killed her or tourists below. New York Police Department rescuers were forced to climb a rickety ladder and gird themselves like mountain climbers to safely bring her down. The nearly four-hour demonstration forced an evacuation of 4,330 people from the statue grounds on one of its busiest days of the year. Okoumou had testified that she couldn't live with the sight of ""children in cages"" and thought climbing the statue was the only way to bring attention to the issue. ""I have had nightmares. I just couldn't live with it,"" she said. Outside court afterward, she stood alongside Kuby, defense attorney Rhidaya Trivedi and California attorney Michael Avenatti, who served as an adviser in the case, as supporters held signs behind her. ""We stand on the right side of history,"" Okoumou said. ""I am not a bit discouraged today."" She said she didn't regret her Statue of Liberty protest. ""The act of climbing the base of the Statue of Liberty went well beyond peaceable protest, a right we certainly respect. It was a crime that put people at grave risk,"" he said, citing the work by NYPD and U.S. Park Police officers who rescued her. Gorenstein allowed Okoumou to remain free without addition bail conditions requested by Assistant U.S. Attorney Brett Kalikow, who said Okoumou had twice tried to climb the Eiffel Tower in Paris and was arrested at an August 2017 Department of Labor protest. This story has been corrected to show that the defendant's first name is Therese, not Theresa."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Ohio police officer pens emotional plea to speeders after ticketing teen for driving 100 mph	"An Ohio police officer told a teenager ""you're welcome"" in an open letter on Facebook Sunday after issuing the 18-year-old a speeding ticket on State Route 10. And the cop hopes other lead-footed drivers will take note. When the officer — who was not identified in the post — with the North Ridgeville Police Department pulled the teenager over for speeding, the driver claimed to not realize how fast he or she was going. But the officer immediately knew that wasn't true. In fact, the official said it should be pretty obvious you're speeding when you hit 100 miles per hour in a 65 mile-per-hour zone. ""You may not realize when you’re doing 45 in a 35 but you are fully aware of every mile per hour at 100. You realize it with every bump you hit. You realize it as you pass cars so fast the wind moves your car. You realize it every time you drift over the line and when you move the wheel the car reacts a lot quicker than you’re used to. You absolutely realized it,"" the officer wrote. The officer said the teen was just ""minutes away"" from causing a Christmas tragedy, potentially harming him or herself as well as others on the road. It was clear the teen was upset — ""visibly shaking and breathing hard"" — after being pulled over by the patrol car, but that wasn't the right reason to panic, the cop added. ""You should have been scared that you were trying to kill yourself. I know you’re invincible. I know that you can’t even fathom your own death,"" the officer continued. ""I can tell you dozens of stories of dead and broken 18-year-old bodies that I’ve pulled from cars. Broken bodies that I’ve found in front yards after crashes. Unrecognizable bodies. They thought they were invincible too. They weren’t."" In the lengthy letter, the officer pleads with the teenager to think about his or her parents or guardians in the future, explaining how they would be devastated if anything happened to their child. ""Sometimes you’re the innocent person hit by someone with no regard for anyone else and sometimes you’re the one with no regard for anyone else. Today you were the latter,"" the official added. At the end of the note, the officer admitted the 18-year-old appeared to be a ""nice kid who made a bad decision,"" though the cop added the ticketed was warranted. ""I don’t feel bad about this ticket at all. In fact, I’m proud of it. I hope you’re paying it off for months and with every payment you think about how it wasn’t worth it. I hope you slow down,"" the note continues, adding once again a reminder that no one is invincible. The Facebook post has been shared by more than 78,000 people and received 6,000 comments as of Monday afternoon. The majority of users thanked the police department for the emotional reminder. ""We have some outstanding cops,"" one Facebook user replied. ""Thank you mr. Officer you could not say it no better way only if the kids realize what damage they can do the other people God bless you and your family,"" another echoed. ""Thank you for stopping him. Job well done,"" a man responded."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Statue of Liberty climber who protested Trump administration found guilty	" A woman who climbed the Statue of Liberty over the summer in protest of the Trump administration was found guilty Monday for the ""dangerous stunt"" which federal prosecutors say endangered law enforcement officers. Therese ""Patricia"" Okoumou was charged with trespassing, interfering with agency functions and disorderly conduct following the event on July 4, to which she pleaded not guilty. Okoumou faces up to 18 months in prison. STATUE OF LIBERTY CLIMBER SPEAKS OUTSIDE COURT, SAYS DECISION TO SCALE MONUMENT WAS 'SPUR OF THE MOMENT' A native of the Democratic Republic of Congo who now lives in Staten Island, Okoumou was represented by Michael Avenatti. Okoumou was protesting Trump's immigration policies on Independence Day when she climbed up to the base of Lady Liberty, roughly 25 feet above the monument's observation point, and refused to leave. The national park was shut down early as a precaution. The woman was apprehended by two New York Police Department officers around four hours later. More than a dozen NYPD Emergency Service Unit officers were involved in the rescue. Okoumou ""endangered herself and the NYPD and U.S. Park Police officers who rescued and apprehended her,"" the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York said in a statement Monday. WOMAN ESCORTED DOWN AFTER SCALING STATUE OF LIBERTY FOLLOWING ANTI-ICE PROTESTS ""The act of climbing the base of the Statue of Liberty went well beyond peaceable protest, a right we certainly respect,"" Attorney Geoffrey Berman said. ""It was a crime that put people at grave risk."" An NYPD detective at the time said Okoumou was ""basically up there saying about the children in Texas."" Nearly 2,000 children were separated from their parents earlier this year after the Trump administration announced a ""zero-tolerance"" policy regarding immigrants who enter the U.S. illegally. In court on Monday, Okoumou said images from the southern border with Mexico gave her nightmares, adding that she couldn't live with the sight of ""children in cages."" Before she scaled the historic monument, Okoumou joined a demonstration from activist group Rise and Resist who hung a banner that read ""ABOLISH ICE"" from the statue's pedestal. The group said they had no idea Okoumou planned to scale the Statue of Liberty. The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Jesuit province releases names of accused abusers	"The Roman Catholic Jesuit province serving much of the eastern United States on Monday released the names of Jesuit priests who face ""credible or established"" accusations of sexual abuse of minors dating to 1950. In a letter, the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus identified five living Jesuits facing offenses that took place in the province and another eight who are dead. The men — part of a Catholic order that includes more than 16,000 men worldwide — served in churches, high schools, colleges and other institutions. It's the latest in a string of similar disclosures from Jesuit governing bodies. Earlier this month, two other Jesuit provinces that cover nearly half the U.S. released the names of more than 150 priests and other ministry leaders found to have ""credible allegations"" of sexual abuse made against them. The letter from the Rev. Robert Hussey, the leader of the Jesuit province headquartered in Maryland, states that most cases date back decades and the most recent incident occurred in 2002. The five still alive are listed as living in supervised housing ""on a safety plan."" He said in the letter, dated Monday, that the province hopes the disclosure ""will contribute to reconciliation and healing."" ""We are deeply sorry for the harm we have caused to victims and their families,"" said Hussey, whose statement was attached to the list of names and accusations. None of the living named Jesuits are in active ministry in the grouping that extends through South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, West Virginia, southern New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and the District of Columbia. While some of the named Jesuit priests were removed from ministry in the 1990s, others were not removed until well after the U.S. church sex abuse scourge exploded in Boston in 2002. One accused priest, Neil McLaughlin, was not removed from ministry until 2007 despite the fact he is believed to have abused youngsters from his ordination in 1959 until the 1980s, with multiple accusations of abuse from Maryland, Pennsylvania, Georgia, New York and Massachusetts. Another Jesuit priest, J. Glenn Murray, was only removed from ministry in 2011, decades after he was accused of a single allegation of sex abuse in Baltimore dating from 1981, a few years after his ordination. David Lorenz, a clergy sex abuse survivor who leads the Maryland chapter of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, said he was glad the Jesuits were putting out a list of abusers so some victims could get some relief and move ahead in their lives. But he stressed that the list was ""wholly inadequate,"" in his view, and the only way to get all the information about church abuse was through subpoenas by independent investigators. ""Unless you force them to open up their records you can't believe that what they're giving you is complete,"" Lorenz said in a phone interview Monday. The Jesuits have previously settled lawsuits across the country, including a $166 million settlement involving about 500 abuse claims in Oregon in 2011, one of the largest settlements involving clergy abuse allegations. The Jesuit president of Maryland's Loyola University, the Rev. Brian F. Linnanne, issued a statement Monday that seven Jesuits on the list were previously affiliated with the institution or with Loyola's Jesuit community. None of the allegations occurred while they were on campus. ""Transparency and openness can reveal weighty truths. We must confront them and address them so we can move forward with optimism, hope, and a conviction that we will never allow such deplorable actions to occur in the future,"" he wrote. In an email, the spokesman for the Baltimore Archdiocese said there was hope that the ""disclosure will advance the culture of transparency that we have worked hard to create and that it will inspire other potential courageous victim-survivors to come forward."" Catholic bishops adopted widespread reforms in 2002 when clergy abuse became a national crisis for the church in the U.S., including stricter requirements for reporting accusations to law enforcement and a streamlined process for removing clerics. But a Pennsylvania grand jury this year made very clear that more changes are needed. In a nearly 900-page report released Aug. 14, the grand jury alleged that more than 300 Roman Catholic priests had abused at least 1,000 children over the past seven decades in six Pennsylvania dioceses. It also accused senior church officials of systematically covering up complaints."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Kansas man gets 109 years for abuse and killing of toddler	"A Kansas man convicted of abusing and killing his girlfriend's 3-year-old son before encasing the boy's body in concrete in their rental home's garage was sentenced Monday to more than 100 years in prison. Judge Steve Ternes sentenced Stephen Bodine to 109 years and six months after telling him during the hearing in Sedgwick County district court: ""Your acts were disgusting and cowardly and monstrous."" Bodine, 41, did not address the court. Bodine was convicted in October of first-degree murder, child abuse and other charges in the torture and killing of Evan Brewer. Prosecutors say Bodine and Evan's mother, Miranda Miller, chained the boy in the basement and forced him to stand in a corner for hours in the months before his May 2017 death at their rental home in Wichita. Evan's body was found that September by the landlord, after Miller and Bodine moved out. Miller, 37, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and other charges last month and is due to be sentenced in January. Her plea deal required her to testify against Bodine. During Bodine's trial, prosecutors presented a cache of 16,000 photos and video files collected by the couple's home surveillance system that detailed the boy's abuse. Miller testified that Bodine made Evan stand against a wall for hours for not eating on May 19, 2017. When the boy collapsed, Bodine took the screaming boy into the bathroom and later came out with his wet and lifeless body. Miller said Bodine mixed bags of concrete and buried the boy's body in it. When Evan's body was found, it was so badly decomposed that an autopsy couldn't determine how he had died. He had Benadryl in his system, and Miller said she thinks Bodine sickened him in the days leading up to his death by force-feeding him large amounts of salt. Evan's father, Carlo Brewer, said he began seeking custody of his son after noticing signs that he had been abused, and authorities were alerted at least six times that Evan was being abused. After the sentencing, Carlo Brewer said he was pleased with the sentence. ""We don't have to worry about him getting out and hurting other people or children. It's turned into a pretty good day,"" he said."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Mother sues in case of missing toddler Ayla Reynolds	"The mother of a toddler whose disappearance prompted the biggest criminal investigation in Maine history sued Monday in hopes of unearthing more details. The announcement came on the seventh anniversary of the date 20-month-old Ayla Reynolds was reported missing by her father in Waterville. Ayla's mother, Trista Reynolds, has blamed the father, Justin DiPietro, for the toddler's death. But the body has never been found, and no charges have been filed. Reynolds and her attorney, William Childs, filed the wrongful death lawsuit alleging DiPietro caused Ayla's death, and said at a news conference that they hope depositions related to the suit will help solve the case. ""Justin, I promise you, wherever you are, one day you will have to face me and tell me the truth of what really happened to Ayla,"" Reynolds told reporters in Portland. ""You can't hide from this forever."" DiPietro did not return phone calls. An email to an address listed under his name was returned by a user who declined to comment. Childs said DiPietro's last known address was in California. The lawsuit seeks a monetary award from DiPietro. But Childs and Reynolds, who held a news conference about the lawsuit during morning snowfall outside court, said they were aware that DiPietro probably has no money to provide. Childs said the lawsuit is more about ""trying to find out how Ayla was killed, why Ayla was killed, and where Ayla was killed."" Detectives have said in the past that adults in the Waterville home where Ayla was last seen alive know more than they have shared with authorities. Sworn testimony from DiPietro and others who were in the house, who could potentially be served subpoenas, could help shed light on exactly what happened that night. Reynolds said she hopes it builds groundwork for eventual criminal charges. State police have long believed the girl is dead, and a judge declared her legally dead in 2017. But the investigation remains open. Maine State Police spokesman Steve McCausland said Monday that the investigation is ""active"" and that police ""remain as committed today as we were seven years ago"" to solving it. Ayla was last seen wearing pajamas with the words ""Daddy's Princess"" on them. DiPietro told police he believed Reynolds was abducted from a home where they were staying in the central Maine city of Waterville. State police ruled that theory out. Ayla was reported missing Dec. 17, 2011. DiPietro said at the time that he had tucked Ayla into bed the night before and found that she was gone the next morning. Searches didn't turn up any evidence. Trista Reynolds now lives in South Portland and has two young children. She said she lights a pink candle every December in Ayla's name. ""We've been at this for seven years,"" she said before the news conference, ""so I've got to have hope somewhere."""	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Ex-Santa impersonator, YMCA worker caught on video assaulting child, 3, officials say"	"A Wisconsin YMCA worker who dressed as Santa for years at the facility's childcare drop-off center was charged with sexual assault after surveillance video captured him assaulting a 3-year-old girl several times, officials said. B.T. Adams, 75, was arrested and charged Thursday with first-degree sexual assault of a child under 13 and conspiracy to commit first-degree child sexual assault, FOX11 reported. Authorities began investigating Adams after a YMCA child case supervisor voiced concern the employee “inappropriately kissed” the toddler while he was working at the location in Oshkosh. Officials reviewed surveillance video that allegedly showed Adams placing his lips on the girl while he inappropriately touched her body. In one video Adams was seen reaching under the 3-year-old’s shirt, FOX11 reported. Adams initially denied kissing the girl and claimed she was “coming at him,” according to the criminal complaint. “Detective Petit reports that she asked him if he was attracted to kids and Adams stated that it was 'not an over attraction.' Adams stated that if they found something he would be totally shocked because he has been able to control it,” the complaint stated. Adams was fired from his position at the YMCA, where he reportedly worked for several years in various roles. Oshkosh Police Chief Dean Smith said in a news conference Thursday that the department received 17 reports from parents regarding Adams since his arrest. Tom Blaze, Oshkosh Community YMCA’s president and CEO, said in a statement to FOX11 that they have been cooperating with the investigation. “We have been and will continue to cooperate fully with the authorities in their investigation into the facts surrounding this situation. Those with questions regarding this situation should contact the Oshkosh Police Department directly at 920-236-5700,” the statement read."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Marines testify about Antifa mob attack in Philadelphia	"Two alleged Antifa activists accused of attacking a pair of Marines in Philadelphia were ordered to stand trial just after Christmas on aggravated assault and conspiracy charges following a dramatic day of testimony last week in which the Marines described being beaten and called ethnic slurs. U.S. Marine Corps reservists Alejandro Godinez and Luis Torres, dressed in their military uniforms, testified Thursday against suspects Thomas Massey and Tom Keenan, who were allegedly part of a larger group of left-wing Antifa activists who began beating the Marines after mistaking them for participants in a November ""We the People"" rally in Old City. The two Marines testified they were in Philadelphia to attend a Marine event at a local hotel and were touring attractions around the city when they were approached by Keenan, who allegedly asked the men if they were “Proud Boys” — an allusion to one of the right-wing groups behind the Nov. 17 rally, the Philly Mag reported. Torres said he didn’t know what “Proud Boys” meant. It was after that interaction, Godinez said, that Keenan, Massey and approximately 10 other people – men and women, some masked and some unmasked – began attacking the Marines: punching and kicking them, using mace and hurling slurs and other insults. ANTIFA MEMBER CHARGED IN ASSAULT OF MARINE RESERVISTS NEAR ‘WE THE PEOPLE’ RALLY IN PHILADELPHIA Godinez testified he was bewildered by being called a white supremacist and reportedly yelled out “I’m Mexican.” But, he said, that didn’t deter his attackers, who then started yelling ethnic slurs as well. “The best way I can describe it is the sound of people chanting in a soccer stadium,” he told the court, adding Keenan was “laughing, smiling, and having a good time, while I could have died that day.” The two Marines said they were taken to Jefferson Hospital after calling 911. Godinez said he was sprayed with mace at least six times, hit in the head and kicked in the ribs. Torres did not receive treatment at the hospital, Philly Mag reported. Keenan and Massey did not speak at the hearing. But Keenan’s attorney was mildly rebuked after referring to the incident as a tussle, leading the judge to reply, “This isn’t like kids at a playground.” A felony charge of ethnic intimidation was added against Keenan for allegedly yelling the ethnic slurs. The two men also face a host of misdemeanor charges. Their next court date is scheduled for Dec. 27."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Drunk Utah man falls into Christmas tree before shooting at roommate, roommate's son"	"A 57-year-old Utah man who was so drunk he had to be helped back to bed after falling into a Christmas tree, paid back his roommate's kindness by opening fire on the man and his son, police said. Randal Weed Dickinson was charged with several crimes for knowingly trying to cause the death of his roommate and the roommate's relative in a Dec. 9 incident in Francis, FOX13 Salt Lake City reported, citing court documents. Dickinson’s roommate told police Dickinson had been drinking all day and was “so drunk he fell into a Christmas tree,” according to the station. The roommate and his son, neither of whom were identified, reportedly escorted Dickinson to his room so he could sleep the intoxication off. When the roommate and his son went outside to smoke a cigarette, they said they heard what sounded like a gun going off. That's when the pair said they saw Dickinson firing at them, getting off 16 shots before the roommate and his son could pin Dickinson until police arrived, KUTV reported. Police noted Dickinson appeared to be intoxicated at the time of the incident, the station reported. Dickinson was charged with two counts of attempted murder, one count of possession of a firearm by a restricted person, 16 counts of felony discharge of a firearm, one count of carrying a dangerous weapon while under the influence and one count of intoxication."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Florida woman tosses piece of concrete at police officer, body cam footage shows"	"A Florida woman was arrested Tuesday after she refused to drop a large piece of concrete -- and instead appeared to attempt to throw it at responding officers, body cam footage shows. Cape Coral Police Department video showed Jessica Blick, 37, on the phone outside a dollar store when officers arrived. It was not immediately clear why she had called authorities and Blick ignored the officers' requests to drop a piece of concrete she was holding in her hand. When Blick noticed another officer approaching her from behind, she appeared to toss the piece of concrete at the cop who had been talking to her. Blick allegedly threatened to kill one of the officers, too, according to FOX 13. One of the officers tried to deploy a Taser on her but missed twice.

"Cremated remains stolen from Nevada post office, sparking reward and plea from family"	"Four sisters from Alabama are pleading for help after their father's cremated remains were among a trio stolen from a post office in Nevada on Friday. Las Vegas Cremations said an employee was in the process of shipping three sets of remains to out-of-state loved ones from a post office around 2 p.m. when they were taken. An employee who was dropping off the packages reported someone drove up in a car, snatched the green tote bags with boxes containing the remains and then drove away. ""I believe the person who took the cremated remains just thought that it was a Christmas package or something like that, not knowing the value of the cremated remains. They truly are invaluable to the family who had the loss,""  Las Vegas Cremations General Manager Philip Smith told FOX5. One of the sets of remains was being shipped to Alabama, where a memorial service was held Saturday for 77-year-old Joel Pugatch. His four daughters told WBRC they were informed about the stolen remains right before the service was due to begin. “Our father passed away in Las Vegas on November 23 and we were hoping to get the remains over the last week or so,"" Deborah Pugatch told WBRC. ""We knew they were going to be shipped over the last couple of days, and then to get this phone call, it’s devastating."" The sisters are hoping that whoever stole the packages realizes their sentimental value to the families. “This is not a replaceable item,” Rachel Storey told WBRC.  “There’s nothing to replace him and we just want him back. We’ve already lost him. Let’s not lose him, the little bit we had.” Las Vegas Cremation said the cremated remains are in white boxes with red ""Priority Mail"" letters and have black stickers on them stating ""Cremated Remains."" The boxes were being carried in green tote bags at the time they were stolen. In addition to the reward, the company is also asking the person who took the remains to turn them into any funeral home anonymously, promising no questions will be asked. Anyone with information on the stolen remains is asked to contact Las Vegas Cremations at (870) 255-1878 or (702) 462-9950."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Coast Guard member kills wife, 7-year-old son, self amid domestic dispute"	"A U.S. Coast Guard member fatally shot his wife and 7-year-old son before turning the gun on himself, authorities said Sunday. Police said the man also shot his 8-year-old daughter, but she survived. The girl was airlifted to a hospital in critical condition, the Miami Herald reported. Miami-Dade police identified the shooter as 44-year-old John Stanley Presnar, who had served since 2001 as an electronics technician. Police say an argument between Presnar and his wife escalated and her mother ran from the home. When officers arrived, they found the bodies and the wounded girl inside. Presnar was reportedly found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. FLORIDA TALE OF INFIDELITY AND HOMICIDE ENDS WITH CONVICTION Presnar’s wife was identified as 39-year-old Gretchen Presnar. The children's names were not released. “When the subject started shooting, his wife told her mother to run out of the house and call for help,” police told the Herald. The shootings happened in the Presnars' southwest Miami-Dade residence, South Florida's Sun-Sentinel reported. Coast Guard spokesman Ryan Kelley said the Coast Guard was “deeply saddened by this tragedy and our hearts go out to the family members of those who were killed. We continue to pray for and offer the full support of the Coast Guard to the young child fighting for her life.” The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Gun-related deaths reached 40-year peak 2017, CDC study finds"	"Gun-related deaths in the U.S. last year reached their highest point in 40 years, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s WONDER database. In 2017, nearly 40,000 people were killed from gun-related incidents in the U.S., according to the data. By contrast, gun-related incidents accounted for less than 29,000 deaths in 1999. Last year marked some of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history. In October 2017, a gunman opened fire on a Las Vegas crowd of 22,000 concertgoers, killing 58 and injuring nearly 500. The following month, a gunman killed 25 people and unborn child at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Of the 40,000 recorded gun-related deaths in 2017, more than a third were homicides while more than half were suicides, according to the CDC data. At 14 deaths per 100,000 people, white men accounted for the highest percentage of suicide deaths by firearm. Black men accounted for the most firearm homicide deaths. Nearly 500 gun deaths were unintentional, according to the CDC, while 553 “contributed to legal intervention and operations of war.” The National Rifle Association responded to the CDC's data, demurring on the merits of more gun control, in a Twitter message. ""The facts are clear,"" the NRA wrote. ""Gun control laws are not the answer. If we want to prevent more horrific acts of violence our leaders need to stop demonizing the men and women of the @NRA and find solutions that will save lives.” Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also weighed in on the report, retorting: ""What is wrong with us? This is not a problem we should have at all, let alone one that's getting worse."" Former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., who has been an outspoken proponent of gun control since being shot in her head and nearly losing her life in 2011, said the CDC’s data, “reminds us how many lives our gun violence crisis alters every year – and why so many Americans are rising up to demand action.” In a statement, Giffords lambasted Congress for refusing to “debate policies we know would help save lives,” while shooting-related deaths keep escalating. The New York Daily News on Sunday cited a study from the BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine that concluded gun deaths accounted for a 2.48-year overall decrease in life expectancy from 2000 to 2016."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Son has '50-50 chance' of survival after spleen ruptures in beating by father	"Louisville police say a boy’s chance of survival is “50-50” after his spleen ruptured following a beating by his father Friday that left the son unconscious, according to reports. Joshua Dossey, 39, has been charged with second-degree assault in the attack, Louisville's WLKY-TV reported. Investigators say Dossey and his son argued Friday in their Louisville home, according to the report. Dossey reportedly told authorities that his son had spat on him and hit him, prompting Dossey to grab his son and punch him in the face. The victim was knocked unconscious, the report said. The son's age was not specified, but he was described as a minor, Louisville's FOX 41 reported. CHARGES IN DEATH OF ANTI-GANG CRUSADER WHO LOST HER DAUGHTER The victim’s grandmother, who had been home, said she called the police and went upstairs to see what was going on, FOX 41 reported. She told police she saw the victim bloodied and lying on the floor while Dossey stood over him. The boy’s identity has not been released because of his age. Dossey was arrested Saturday and booked at Metro Corrections around 8:30 p.m. on a $250,000 bond, WLKY reported. His arraignment is scheduled for Monday.

"Jogger Karina Vetrano's suspected killer complains about lewd Riker's Island inmates, guards"	"The suspect in the murder of Karina Vetrano, a woman who was sexually attacked and strangled while running near her family’s New York City home, has been triggered by what he described as lewd acts on behalf of prisoners and guards at Rikers Island, according to a report. “Captains are trying to tell inmates to beat me up,” Chanel Lewis, 22, told The New York Post about corrections supervisors. Lewis added that correction officers were instructing inmates to call him a “f----t, the a-word and the p-word.” Lewis told the Post that the semen of his fellow inmates -- who were masturbating frequently -- got into his food. He said the inmates got the semen on the hands of female correction officers who then passed him his food and water. “Female guards hands [are a] health hazard. Food inside the hot pot is contaminated,” Lewis told the Post. Lewis, 22, was accused of killing 30-year-old Karina Vetrano as she ran on a park trail in Howard Beach, Queens, in August 2016. Prosecutors said Vetrano had been sexually abused and strangled. Her father discovered the body. Prosecutors said they’ll move to retry Lewis, who is expected back in court on Jan. 20. The closely watched case had baffled investigators, who for months were unable to find anyone who matched DNA that was found under the victim’s fingernails as she fought back. The DNA also was found on her neck and phone. CHICAGO MAN WHO CLAIMED HE WAS STABBED IN ROBBERY ACTUALLY CUT HIMSELF IN FIGHT WITH GIRLFRIEND, COPS SAY Robert Boyce, the New York Police Department's chief of detectives, said the break came after police went back through 911 calls and found one reporting a suspicious person in the area near the attack. Lewis was tested and linked to DNA found at the scene and on the victim, Boyce said. In his taped confession, Lewis told police that he was upset with a neighbor and that when he came across Vetrano on a secluded section of a marshland park, he “just lost it.” He said he beat and strangled her but did not molest her. “This girl jogging... and you know, one thing led to another,” he told detectives. “Hitting her and stuff like that.” His attorneys said the confession was wrongly obtained and should not have been admissible in the trial. They said he confessed only because he wanted to go home after waiting hours in an interrogation room. Defense attorney Robert Moeller said the case was based on circumstantial evidence. He argued that the crime scene was corrupted and that DNA evidence was suspect. “This case is far from conclusive, and the jury’s deadlock proves this,” the Legal Aid Society, which helped provide defense for Lewis, said in a statement. “The death of Karina Vetrano is tragic and our hearts go out to her family, but the rush to criminalize our client is not the answer nor is it justice.” The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Chicago man who claimed he was stabbed in robbery cut himself during spat with girlfriend	"A man who told police he was stabbed during a robbery in downtown Chicago last month actually shoplifted razor blades from a nearby drugstore and cut himself after arguing with his girlfriend, investigators said Sunday. Javier Paredes, 32, was charged with retail theft, false reporting and disorderly conduct, and was ordered held on $450 bail following a hearing. Emergency responders in the Magnificent Mile commercial district found him on the morning of Nov. 14 with cuts to his abdomen. He claimed he'd been robbed, but prosecutors said security cameras in the area showed no such incident. However, police officers examining the footage spotted Paredes taking the blades from a CVS drugstore approximately 20 minutes before he reported the stabbing. Paredes was arrested Thursday after officers found him pulling the handles of gangway fences on the city's Southwest Side. After his arrest, officers identified him as the shoplifting suspect. According to Cook County Assistant State’s Attorney Rebecca Wiggers, Paredes admitted to officers that he'd stabbed himself after an argument with his girlfriend during which he threatened to harm himself.

Mom in toddler tussle video says she went into defense mode	"A mother who had her toddler yanked from her arms by New York police in a widely seen video said in an interview published Sunday that she went into ""defense mode."" ""In my head, I told myself they're not going to let me leave,"" Jazmine Headley told The New York Times. ""I was so afraid. I was combative with my thoughts."" The video captured the chaotic scene that unfolded Dec. 7 as officers tried to remove Headley from a crowded Brooklyn social services office, where she had sat on the floor for two hours because of a lack of chairs. Police were called when she refused a security guard's order to leave. Headley told the Times she was sitting on the floor with her back against the wall and talking to her son, who was in a stroller. She said she refused, pointing out trash and recycling bins against the wall on the other side of her son's stroller. ""I just remember being talked to very viciously,"" she said. ""It was more or less: 'You're going to do what I say, and that's it.'"" Headley said her memory of the incident is blurry. She said she picked up her son and tried to leave after one of the officers said they didn't want to arrest her. Police said one of the guards then grabbed the 23-year-old mother's arm and they fell to the ground. Headley said she again tried to go but a police officer told her it was too late. ""I should've left, and I didn't because if I would've left, my son would not have the things that he needs,"" Headley said. The two security guards have been placed on modified duty. The guard's union president, Gregory Floyd, said they tried to reason with Headley for 40 minutes before police arrived. He said one of the guards was bitten during the tussle.

Georgia K-9 that lost eye after being shot in head is released from hospital	"A Georgia K-9 that was shot during a traffic-stop confrontation that killed a police officer has lost an eye, but was released from a veterinary hospital Saturday and is expected to make a full recovery. Indi, a K-9 officer with the DeKalb County Police Department, was shot in the head on Thursday, east of Atlanta. The gunman, identified by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation as 33-year-old Brandon Taylor, ran from a traffic stop and killed Officer Edgar Isidro Flores, a 24-year-old who had just graduated from the police academy last year, investigators said. After he killed Flores, Taylor then ran again before opening fire on the K-9, which had tracked him down, investigators added. Three SWAT officers then fired at Taylor, who later was pronounced dead. OFFICERS KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY IN 2018 The police department wrote on an Instagram post that after Indi was shot, the dog received ""the most compassionate and professional care.""

"Jayme Closs' family, community hold out hope 2 months after teen's disappearance"	"Two months after 13-year-old Jayme Closs vanished from her Wisconsin home after her parents were shot and killed inside, family members marked the day Saturday with a plea for anyone with information to come forward. A group that included members of the community and Closs' grandfather released balloons near a 16-foot tree of hope decorated with messages such as ""pray for Jayme"" that was lit last week in Barron, Wis. “I want nothing more than to get my granddaughter back to me and her family where she belongs,” Robert Naiberg, Jayme’s grandfather, told those gathered for the ceremony. Naiberg said it’s been a terrible two months since the death of his daughter and son-in-law and agonizing to not know what happened to his granddaughter. “We need answers, but nobody seems to have any answers, so we don’t know any more than anyone else does. That’s what’s hard,” he said. Authorities have combed through hundreds of tips since Oct. 15, when Denise and James Closs were found murdered inside their home in Barron, Wis. Police responded to the home after receiving a cryptic 911 call where dispatchers spoke to no one but heard distant voices and a loud commotion on the other end. Four minutes later, the couple’s bodies were located and Jayme was nowhere to be seen.

Escaped child killer missing for more than 40 years may be ‘hiding in plain sight	"A convicted child murderer who has eluded authorities for more than four decades may be living under an alias in one of two states and “hiding in plain sight,” according to federal officials. The U.S. Marshals Service added Lester Eubanks to its “15 Most Wanted List” on Dec. 7 in hopes of ending his 45-year stint on the lam. “The U.S. Marshals are not deterred by the passage of time when it comes to cases like this one,” U.S. Marshal Peter Elliott of the Northern District of Ohio said in a statement. “We are fueled by one thing, and that is justice for 14-year-old Mary Ellen Deener of Mansfield, Ohio, the innocent victim in this case.” On Nov. 14, 1965, Eubanks shot and bludgeoned to death Mary Ellen in what law enforcement allege was an attempted rape. Authorities quickly identified Eubanks as the offender, and he was arrested the next day and charged with first-degree murder while perpetrating rape. On May 25, 1966, a jury found Eubanks guilty of the crimes and sentenced him to death. In 1972, Eubanks’ death sentence was commuted to life in prison without the possibility of parole. But it was on Dec. 7, 1973, when Eubanks eventually made his escape, after prison officials took him to a shopping center in Columbus, Ohio. He was allowed to walk unescorted as a reward for good behavior, and then never showed at his scheduled pick up location. “While the Eubanks case is designated as a cold case, I want to assure the public our investigation into his whereabouts is very active,”  U.S. Marshals Service Deputy Director David Anderson said in a statement. “I have total confidence in our deputies and our law enforcement partners who are determined to make sure Eubanks’ last days are spent in a prison cell where justice intended it.” HUMAN REMAINS FOUND IN SEARCH FOR FLORIDA WOMAN WHO VANISHED IN 2010, POLICE SAY Eubanks, who would now be 75, is believed to be alive and living under an alias, according to the agency. Investigative leads over the years have placed him in Michigan and California, and officials said his whereabouts remain a mystery. A reward of up to $25,000 is available for information leading to his arrest. Deputy U.S. Marshal David Siler said that Eubanks may have changed his appearance, used aliases and even started a new life. “He literally could be hiding in plain sight,” Siler said. “This is why we are asking citizens to be vigilant and contact us with any information they believe will help us apprehend him.” Eubanks is described by officials as a 5 foot, 11 inches tall black male with black hair and brown eyes. He also has a mole under his left eye. At the time of his disappearance in 1973, he weighed approximately 175 pounds. Eubanks may be using the alias “Victor Young,” according to federal officials. Anyone with information on Eubanks or his possible whereabouts is urged to contact the nearest U.S. Marshals office or the U.S. Marshals Service Communications Center at 1-800-336-0102."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Cyntoia Brown deserves clemency, Tennessee Democrats tell state's departing GOP governor"	"Democratic leaders in Tennessee are calling for the state’s outgoing Republican governor to grant clemency to a woman serving a life sentence for a murder she committed when she was a teenager. At a news conference Friday to draw attention to Cyntoia Brown’s case, several Democrats asked for Gov. Bill Haslam to act before he leaves office next month, the Tennessean reported. CYNTOIA BROWN, SERVING LIFE FOR MURDER, ASKS TENNESSEE PAROLE BOARD FOR CLEMENCY: A LOOK AT HER CASE ""Do not kick this decision down the road for Gov.-elect [Bill] Lee,"" said Sen. Brenda Gilmore. ""To keep her in prison for 51 years is another travesty."" The state Supreme Court recently ruled that people convicted of first-degree murder in that state and sentenced to life as of July 1995 must serve at least 51 years before becoming eligible for parole. Haslam has said he not reached a decision on the matter yet and didn’t want to treat Brown’s case differently because of the publicity it’s received. ""We are reviewing every aspect of it, just like we are with several other ... similar cases,"" Haslam said. Brown admitted in 2004 to fatally shooting 43-year-old Johnny Allen White while the two were in bed because she believed he was reaching for a gun. She was 16 at the time. Prosecutors argued she killed White, a real estate agent, in order to rob him. Advocates said that Brown, now 30, was a teen prostitute at the time of the killing. They say she was the victim of sex trafficking and has since earned an associate’s degree while in prison. BROWN BE PAROLED? ACE LAWYER JOINS TEAM TO FREE SEX-TRAFFICKED TEEN SERVING LIFE SENTENCE FOR KILLING JOHN ""We cannot forget and we must not forget that Ms. Brown herself was a victim,"" said state Rep. Ray Clemmons. He pledged to re-introduce a bill to allow juvenile sentences to be reviewed. Brown’s case has become a cause celebre, attracting the attention of celebrities such as Kim Kardashian West, Rihanna and advocacy groups. She is also the subject of a PBS documentary. On Saturday, a few dozen activists marched at Georgia’s state Capitol in Atlanta to urge Haslam to grant Brown clemency, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. “We are demanding that our sister Cyntoia be set free,” said Lea Allen, a Baptist minister."	nonTerrorism	Crime
California customs agent found guilty of conspiring to smuggle drugs for LA to Chicago	"A federal customs officer accused of hiring a trucker to smuggle large quantities of drugs across the country has been found guilty in Los Angeles, according to reports.

The pair have an April 15 sentencing date and each face a minimum of 10 years in prison. The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Woman convicted of plotting with lover to kill husband, collect $1.75 million life insurance benefits"	"A Florida woman has been convicted of conspiring with her lover to kill her husband—18 years after he disappeared and she collected $1.75 million in life insurance benefits when his death was ruled an accident. Denise Williams, 48, reportedly showed no emotion as the verdict was delivered Friday in Leon County after a week-long trial that included details of threesomes and drew comparisons to the film noir classic “Double Indemnity.” She now faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison after being found guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the death of her 31-year-old husband, Mike Williams, who vanished Dec. 16, 2000 on a duck hunting trip. “We got justice for Michael,” the victim’s mother said to prosecutor Jon Fuchs, the Tallahassee Democrat reported Friday. Cheryl Williams refused to believe her son drowned and was eaten by alligators, the newspaper reported. Prosecutors said Denise Williams hatched the murder plot with a man who was her husband’s best friend -- and her lover, Brian Winchester. He became the prosecution’s star witness, testifying that they killed Michael Williams so they could be together and collect on life insurance policies by making the murder look like an accident, according to the reports. Winchester sold Mike Williams one of those policies, worth $1 million. Winchester told the jury that plans to make the murder look like a drowning went awry when Michael Williams’ duck-hunting equipment failed to drag him underwater. He testified that he wound up shooting Michael Williams in the face with a 12-gauge shotgun and then burying the body near a lake, according to reports. The New York Post reported that Winchester and Denise Willaims carried on their secret relationship until 2005 when they married. But 11 years later they divorced and soon after he was arrested for kidnapping Denise Williams at gunpoint to convince her not to turn him in to police, according to the paper. Eventually, he confessed to killing Michael Williams in exchange for immunity and led authorities to the body. The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Santa' shot at while driving on Texas freeway	"One Texas man won’t appear on Santa Claus’ “Nice List” after opening fire Tuesday on another man dressed up as Santa. A man wearing a Santa costume, whose identity remains unknown but was identified by police as ""Santa,"" and his wife – referred to by police as ""Mrs. Claus"" – were driving home when the suspect in a red car cut them off and kept blocking them until they exited the road. Police Capt. Jerry Cozby told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that the driver of the red car then began shooting at Santa’s car. The man said that the vehicle was hit twice. “I saw them exiting and I thought it was over, but then we started hearing gunshots and the car was hit twice,” he said, according to NBC 5. But authorities say it’s likely the car was hit only once. “Mrs. Claus showed us something where she thought the bullet might have ‘bounced off’ the car,” Cozby told the Star-Telegram. “But bullets don’t generally bounce off cars, so I’m not sure what she was looking at.” Neither Santa nor Mrs. Claus were hurt, police said. While the police said it wants to contact the shooter, the victims couldn’t provide any helpful information beyond the color of the car and even said they don’t want to pursue the matter. ""Funny enough, Santa didn’t want to make a report,” Cozby told the paper. “He didn’t have any interest in that, he said nobody was hurt. We did provide him information about insurance for his vehicle."" It remains unclear if the incident was a result of road rage."	nonTerrorism	Crime

Police say video of toddler yanked from mom not whole story	"The New York City police commissioner said Friday that a more complicated and ""chaotic"" story is emerging from a witness video that went viral showing a tug-of-war between a New York mother with a toddler and police yanking the boy from her. Police said an internal review found that Jazmine Headley had used the child as a shield to avoid arrest on Dec. 7 at a Brooklyn social services office. According to the review — based on information from witnesses and officers at the scene with body cameras — the 23-year-old woman became verbally abusive and bit the arm of a security employee at the Human Resources Administration who tried to remove her after she sat on the floor, blocking others. She then took the child from his stroller and refused to budge, flailing when approached, witnesses cited in the review said.

"Border agents seize $1.7 million in meth, in second largest drug bust this week"	"Officials seized nearly $1.3 million worth of meth at the U.S.-Mexico Border in Texas on Thursday, marking the second time this week that agents thwarted a significant narcotics smuggling attempt. Agents with Customs and Border Protection and the Office of Field Operations were alerted to a 2018 Chevrolet Silverado attempting to enter the U.S. through the Juarez-Lincoln International Bridge. According to border officials, a canine search of the vehicle revealed that the 27-year-old female driver and her 28-year-old passenger were attempting to smuggle in 94 pounds of alleged methamphetamine, an estimated street value of $1,322,848. “Our CBP officers’ hard work, perseverance, and utilization of canines and our non-intrusive imaging systems resulted in the interception of this significant load of methamphetamine,” Port Director Albert Flore of Laredo Port of Entry said in a statement. Thursday’s bust comes just days after agents at the Pharr-Reynosa International Bridge cargo facility seized a trailer with an estimated $7 million worth of narcotics. “Our frontline CBP continues to maintain their vigilance and utilize their inspections skills and experience as pre-Christmas traffic starts to increase,” Flore also said. The two women from Thursday’s incident were arrested and turned over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement-Homeland Security Investigations unit."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Deacon removed from ministry after calling for investigation	"A deacon who has questioned the thoroughness of a recently published list of Tennessee priests accused of sexual abuse has been removed from ministry at his local parish. Nashville Deacon Ron Deal confirmed Friday he has been instructed not to minister at the Brentwood parish until his ""public disagreement"" with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Nashville diocese is resolved. The Nov. 30 letter was sent from Deal's church pastor, Rev. Joe McMahon. Deal is one of the many victim advocates who have called for an independent investigation after the diocese earlier this year published the names of 13 priests accused of sexually abusing minors. ""My question to them is how do you propose ending it?"" Deal said in a telephone interview. ""I would love to find a way to keep this issue front and center, but I'm not sure how we make that (resolution) happen if it doesn't involve speaking openly."" Diocese spokesman Rick Musacchio says Deal has not been suspended and he continues to receive a stipend, but says a resolution could be reached if Deal stops publicly criticizing the church. ""The pastor has asked him to resolve the issue,"" Musacchio said in a telephone interview. ""It's fair to say the public statements are tending to cause the confusion."" Deal was one of the speakers at a November press conference calling for an independent investigation and he has since asked state lawmakers to look into the issue. The names released in November included priests who served from the 1940s to the 1990s. The list did not include information about when church leaders were made aware of the allegations or estimates of the total number of victims. However, the quality of the diocese's investigation was called into question by critics when the list was quickly amended after Deal and others pointed out names were missing when it was first shared. When it was eventually published, one of the priest's names was listed as dead when he was really alive. Deal says the church's initial mistakes with releasing the list proves his calls for an independent investigation are warranted. To date, no law enforcement agency has done so in Tennessee, though Deal has maintained contact with the state's attorney general, U.S. attorneys and district attorneys. The investigation comes on the heels of a grand jury investigation in Pennsylvania that concluded more than 1,000 children had been abused over a span of decades by about 300 priests. This has led for calls for more independent investigations across the country. Musacchio says the Nashville diocese is ready to cooperate with any investigation, should one be launched. ""What does it say about transparency and openness when a deacon is removed for trying to assure that the whole truth is coming out from the diocese?"" says Susan Vance, one of the leaders of Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests of Tennessee. ""We have many problems with the dioceses of Knoxville, Nashville and Memphis."""	nonTerrorism	Crime
Sheriff disputes injuries black man suffered in beating	"A Tennessee sheriff's office is disputing the extent of the injuries suffered by a black man beaten by a white officer while handcuffed earlier this month. An attorney for 25-year-old Charles Toney said in a phone interview Friday that hospital records prove Toney suffered a collapsed lung and fractured ribs, nose and finger during his arrest on an outstanding warrant on Dec. 3. The Hamilton County Sheriff's Office said in a news release Thursday that medical staff who checked Toney after his arrest found none of the injuries described by Toney's attorney, Lee Merritt. Video taken by a bystander shows Hamilton County Detective Blake Kilpatrick punching and kicking Toney while he is handcuffed and on the ground. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating. The arrest report says Kilpatrick struck Toney because he was uncooperative and bit the officers' finger. Merritt says those allegations are false and has called on the district attorney to drop assault and resisting-arrest charges against Toney. A copy of the jail's medical intake form lists no injuries other than ""swelling in mouth, jaw or neck."" Under a section on lesions, bruises and scars, the medic wrote ""WNL"" for ""within normal limits."" Toney's mugshot, taken at roughly the same time, shows blood and scratches in several places on his face. On Friday, Merritt told The Associated Press that the intake form shows that the jail medical staff did not do a thorough evaluation of Toney's injuries, not that he wasn't injured. Toney was released within hours of his arrest after posting bond and went to the hospital the next day, Merritt said. Kilpatrick is on desk duty while the incident is under investigation. This story has been corrected to show that Toney's attorney says his client suffered one fractured finger, not multiple fractured fingers."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Montana man pleads guilty to killing 2, putting them in acid"	"A Montana man pleaded guilty Friday to stabbing two people to death, including a teenage girl, dismembering their bodies and then trying to dissolve them in tubs filled with acid in the basement of a home. Augustus Standingrock's plea was part of a deal with prosecutors, who will recommend the 26-year-old be sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole. He pleaded guilty to deliberate homicide and accountability to deliberate homicide in the deaths last year of Marilyn Pickett, 15, and Jackson Wiles, 24. Prosecutors have said Standingrock believed Wiles had sexually abused a young girl close to him. The two were killed at the Missoula house of co-defendant Tiffanie Pierce, who still faces charges of deliberate homicide. She has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled for trial in March. During Friday's court hearing, Standingrock told District Judge James Wheelis that he stabbed Wiles and that Pierce killed Pickett, the Missoulian newspaper reported. The judge asked if Pickett had been free to escape the home. ""She tried,"" Standingrock answered. He said he handed Pierce the knife and didn't stop her when she attacked the teen. Pierce's roommate told police he was awakened by a woman's screams in August 2017, according to court records. He said he found Pierce and Standingrock in the bathroom washing off blood and that Pierce told him there was a dead woman in the basement. Pierce later told her roommate that Standingrock brought over a couple of people and that he took them to the basement and attacked one while Pierce attacked the other, the roommate told investigators. Standingrock and Pierce dismembered the bodies and tried to dissolve them in tubs filled with chemicals that she bought, prosecutors said. Officials said the coroner needed dental records and DNA to identify the bodies. Investigators also found knives and an ax covered in blood and human tissue. Standingrock had been scheduled for trial on Jan. 4. Missoula County Attorney Kirsten Pabst previously said she would not seek the death penalty."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Texas mom sentenced in deaths of toddlers inside hot car	"A Texas mother whose two toddlers died after she left them inside a hot vehicle overnight was sentenced to 40 years in prison. Amanda Hawkins, 20, learned her punishment Wednesday for the June 2017 deaths of her two daughters in Kerrville, which is about 65 miles (105 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio, the Kerrville Daily Times reported. Hawkins pleaded guilty in September to two counts of child abandonment and endangerment, and two counts of injury to a child. She received two 20-year sentences for each daughter's case, which she's ordered to serve consecutively. Hawkins left 1-year-old Brynn Hawkins and 2-year-old Addyson Overgard-Eddy inside her vehicle while she visited friends at a Kerrville home on June 6, 2017, according to police reports. Hawkins was smoking marijuana with friends in a shed outside the home that night. Witnesses reported hearing the toddlers crying inside the car, where temperatures reached into the 80s. Hawkins retrieved the girls from the car the following afternoon when the temperature inside the car was estimated to have been 119 degrees, according to a vehicle interior temperature scale formulated by San Francisco State University. She bathed the children and searched on the internet how to treat heat stroke before taking the toddlers to the hospital, prosecutors said. The girls were pronounced dead at a San Antonio hospital on June 8, 2017. ""The most compelling piece of evidence was the slow and painful deaths these children endured — with cramps, headaches, seizures, anxiety and wondering 'where's mommy,'"" said Kerr County Judge N. Keith Williams. Hawkins apologized for her actions before Williams issued his sentencing decision. ""There's not a day that goes by that I think about what I should have done,"" Hawkins said. ""It's heartbreaking, and it will affect me for the rest of my life."""	nonTerrorism	Crime
Human remains found in search for Florida woman who vanished in 2010	"Lynda Meier vanished after leaving her Florida apartment at around 5 a.m. on June 4, 2010. On Wednesday, police may have finally discovered where she ended up. Human remains were discovered while investigators were searching a Miami Gardens field for Meier, police said Thursday. The medical examiner’s office will have to determine whether the remains belong to Meier, who was 40 years old at the time she disappeared. “During this investigation, investigators located what appears to be human remains near the area in which Meier was last believed to have been,” Hallandale Beach spokeswoman Ra Shana Dabney-Donovan said in a statement. A search for human remains in the Miami Gardens area was launched earlier in the week when authorities received a tip from a “source” about a body that had been dumped in a tree preserve, the Miami Herald reported. The remains were discovered in a wooded area between a construction site and a house, Osvy Rivera, a worker at the construction site, told the newspaper. “I pray to God she didn’t suffer,” Sharon Solano, one of Meier’s friends, told CBS Miami Meier disappeared in 2010. She had plans to take her mother, who lived in Aventura, to a doctor’s appointment but never showed up to her mom's home, according to the Miami Herald. Surveillance video showed Meier leaving her apartment in Hallandale Beach at around 5:17 a.m. that day. Two days later, her abandoned Cadillac Escalade was discovered near an apartment complex in Miami Gardens, police said. Police questioned two felons who had contact with Meier, but were never able to link the men to her disappearance, the newspaper reported.

Man accused of causing horrific car crash that killed retired Marine already suspected of attempted kidnapping	"The man accused of causing a horrific multi-vehicle crash Wednesday in Houston -- killing a retired Marine and a woman -- was wearing an ankle monitor in connection with a 2017 case in which he allegedly tried to kidnap a woman at a cemetery. Charles Glaze, 54, is alleged to have caused the deadly seven-car crash on the Grand Parkway near Tomball after his truck went across the median and veered into oncoming traffic, FOX26 reported. He was hospitalized after the crash with non-life-threatening injuries. Michael Brown, 78, a retired Marine who served in the Vietnam War, was killed in the crash. His wife, Charlotte, broke her collarbone and was recovering in the hospital, KHOU11 reported.

He positively impacted this whole community."" Glaze told investigators he has a history of seizures and did not recall what occurred before the pile-up. It was not immediately clear if he would face charges related to the deadly crash. At the time of the incident, investigators said he was found wearing an ankle monitor. Glaze was accused in a June 2017 attack on a woman at the Klein Memorial Park Cemetery in Magnolia, Texas. The woman was at the cemetery to visit a loved one’s grave when Glaze allegedly used a stun gun on her, gagging her and pointing a gun at her head, the Houston Chronicle reported citing court documents. The woman was able to flee and Glaze was charged with “aggravated assault with a deadly weapon,” FOX26 reported."	nonTerrorism	Crime

Cop saves man from frigid waters: ‘God definitely put me there for a reason’	"A Rhode Island police officer is being hailed a hero after saving a man from drowning in cold water. Jamestown Police Officer Nathaniel Schaffer was covering another employee’s shift the night he responded to a frantic 911 call a little before 1 a.m. from a woman who said her friend was in the water off a pier. ""I think God definitely put me there for a reason,"" Schaffer told FOX Providence, but he added that ""any other officer would have done the same thing given the circumstances."" When Shaffer arrived at the scene, the 34-year-old man from Brighton, Massachusetts, was initially responsive in the water and according to his friend, he willingly jumped into the water but as time passed he wasn’t responding to the officer. ""He became lifeless. He kinda floated, rolled over to his side,"" Schaffer said. ""His mouth was half in the water, half out. He was taking in water with each breath."" While his sergeant was grabbing a flotation device, Schaffer jumped in. Shaffer grabbed the man and swam to the ladder but the dock was too high to climb six feet, so they decided to go to a lower dock about 100 feet away. By the time rescue crews had arrived to get the man out of the water, Schaffer said he was unresponsive and foaming at the mouth. Both were transported to the Newport Hospital. Schaffer was treated for mild hypothermia and the man recovered after a few days as well. On Tuesday night, the man he saved paid a visit to the police station to thank Shaffer in person and assured him that he wasn’t going to go swimming in that pier again."	nonTerrorism	Crime

Florida execution is 'closure' for kin of woman brutally stabbed to death in 1992	" A man convicted of viciously stabbing a woman to death during a South Florida burglary 26 years ago was executed Thursday night. Jose Antonio Jimenez, 55, was put to death by lethal injection and pronounced dead by 9:48 p.m. at Florida State Prison in Starke. The execution was initially set for 6 p.m. but was delayed by a last-minute stay request to the U.S. Supreme Court, which was declined. Jimenez declined to make any last statements, the Miami Herald reported. Jimenez was convicted of the 1992 death of Phyllis Minas, 63, during a burglary inside her Miami apartment. Authorities said he was in the middle of burglarizing the residence when Minas came home. She was stabbed eight times. “Mr. Jimenez has shown no remorse or repentance for his crime,” Minas nephew Alan Partee said in a written statement released by the Florida Department of Corrections after the execution. “His execution will allow closure to a painful memory of the vicious murder ... My family hopes he has made peace with himself and to whatever power he may or may not believe in. We pray for his soul and feel justice has been rightfully served.” During Jimenez's week-long trial in 1994, neighbors said they heard her screaming during the attack and tried to enter the apartment but someone had locked the door. Fingerprints inside the apartment matched Jimenez, prosecutors said, and a custodian said he saw Jimenez jump from the balcony of Minas’ second-floor apartment. Jimenez’s attorney’s argued the evidence against him was circumstantial. TEXAS MAN WHO ALLEGEDLY TRIED, FAILED TO KIDNAP TEEN JOGGER IS EXECUTED In several failed appeals over the years, Jimenez and his lawyers said detectives gave “false, or, at best, misleading testimony.” They also argued several key police reports had been lost. The request to the Supreme Court for an execution stay asked the court to consider whether Florida’s lethal injection protocol is cruel and unusual punishment and violates the Eighth Amendment. MAN GETS 9 YEARS IN PRISON FOR SEX ASSAULT ON FLIGHT After Gov. Rick Scott signed off on the lethal injection for Jimenez, the Florida Supreme Court issued a stay order to consider Jimenez’s claims, including his denial of access to public records, that the state’s drug protocol could cause him harm and that it was cruel to execute him after 23 years on death row. In October, the court rejected the claims and lifted the order. Jimenez was the fifth killer executed since Florida added a drug to its lethal cocktails. In 2017, the state included etomidate — a drug intended to induce unconsciousness during executions. The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Indian man gets 9 years in prison for sex assault on flight	"An Indian man living in the U.S. on a work visa was sentenced to nine years in prison Thursday for sexually assaulting a sleeping woman during an overnight flight to Detroit. Prabhu Ramamoorthy was in a middle seat between the victim and his wife on a Spirit Airlines flight from Las Vegas last January. The 23-year-old victim said he unzipped her pants, unbuttoned her shirt and molested her with his hands. Prosecutors asked for a sentence of nearly 11 years, but U.S. District Judge Terrence Berg settled on a nine-year term. He said he hoped it would be ""grave enough"" to deter others from committing similar crimes. A jury convicted Ramamoorthy in August . He will be deported to India after serving his sentence. The victim, a model, declined an opportunity to speak in court. She watched the hearing from the first row with her boyfriend and a support dog. At trial, she testified that she woke up during the flight and ""saw his hands inside me."" She said she felt ""petrified, frozen."" ""Everyone has the right to be secure and safe when they travel on airplanes. ... We appreciate the victim in this case for her courage to speak out,"" U.S. Attorney Matthew Schneider said. Ramamoorthy, 35, has lived in suburban Detroit since arriving in the U.S. on a work visa in 2015. He and his wife were returning to Detroit on the Las Vegas flight after a trip to the Grand Canyon. Speaking through a Tamil interpreter, Ramamoorthy said he didn't want to make a statement before getting his sentence. The judge noted a lack of remorse but acknowledged that Ramamoorthy had a right to stay silent. Defense attorney James Amberg asked for a prison sentence of less than 10 years. He said the conviction will bring ""severe and lifelong consequences"" to Ramamoorthy and his wife when they return to southern India. ""His life is effectively over,"" Amberg told Berg."	nonTerrorism	Crime

The Latest: Report sheds no light on how man fled hospital	"The Latest on man facing trial for escaping from a Hawaii psychiatric facility (all times local): A nearly 1,600-page report by the Hawaii attorney general's office provides no new significant details into how a man committed to a psychiatric hospital was able to escape and fly to California before authorities were notified he was missing. The redacted report was posted online Thursday, more than a day after officials announced an investigation found no single hospital employee responsible for Randall Saito's escape. The report details interviews with employees who describe lax oversight of Saito, who was sent to Hawaii State Hospital after he was found not guilty by reason of insanity of a woman's murder more than 35 years ago. The report says Saito was allowed to roam hospital grounds unescorted and was required to call in from a hospital phone every hour. The report says there was no log book to document the calls. The report says patient counts at change of shifts were not consistently done, including on the day he escaped. The attorney representing a man who escaped from a Hawaii psychiatric hospital says his client wants to go to trial. Attorney Michael Green says Randall Saito ""wants to get his story out there."" Saito appeared via video from a Honolulu jail Thursday to be arraigned in court on charges of escape and identity theft. Green pleaded not guilty on Saito's behalf. In November 2017, Saito walked out of Hawaii State Hospital, where he was sent in 1981 after he was found not guilty by reason of insanity for killing a woman. Saito was captured days later in Stockton, California. Green told The Associated Press outside court that while the escape is a ""foregone conclusion,"" Saito wants to fight the identity theft charge.

Hawaii trial set for psychiatric patient charged in escape	"A man who spent decades in a Hawaii psychiatric hospital for killing a woman wants to go to trial on escape and identity theft charges after authorities said he fled the facility and flew to California before being captured, his defense attorney said Thursday. Randall Saito appeared via video from a Honolulu jail on Thursday and watched as attorney Michael Green entered a not guilty plea on his behalf at his arraignment. ""He wants to get his story out there,"" Green told The Associated Press. In November 2017, authorities said Saito walked out of Hawaii State Hospital, where he was sent in 1981 after he was acquitted of murder by reason of insanity in the 1979 killing of Sandra Yamashiro. After leaving the hospital, Saito called a taxi that took him to the airport, where he took a chartered flight to Maui. He used an alias to arrange the flight and paid $1,445 cash for it, prosecutors said. Then he took a commercial flight to San Jose, California, prosecutors said. When he was arrested in Stockton, California three days after his escape, he had more than $6,000 in cash and fake Washington state and Illinois driver's licenses bearing his photos with different names, prosecutors said. While the escape is a ""foregone conclusion,"" Saito wants to fight the identity theft charge, Green said. While jailed in California, Saito gave various interviews with reporters, including the AP. He said he escaped to show that he should be free. ""I was just trying to get as much time as possible under my belt to prove my point that I could be in the community without supervision and not be truculent or violent or stupid,"" Saito said at the time. A state attorney general's office investigation found no single employee directly responsible for the escape. A nearly 1,600-page redacted copy of the report doesn't offer any significant details into how Saito was able to escape and fly to California before authorities were notified he was missing. Lax oversight contributed to Saito's escape, the report said. ""The absence of comprehensive procedures to account for patients' whereabouts, the lack of communication between staff performing different functions, and the relaxing of patient oversight contributed not only to Saito's being able to escape from the facility but to an eleven-hour delay in reporting this escape,"" it said. Patient counts were not conducted on the day Saito escaped because staff members didn't have time to do them, according to an unnamed employee interviewed for the report. Saito had established and continued to reap the benefits of an ""honor system,"" whereby he was free to roam the grounds unsupervised and everyone expected him to return to his unit at the end of the day,"" he report said. After Saito's escape, six hospital employees were placed on off-duty status. Two have since retired, and the other four will be reinstated. No employees will be disciplined. The state would have difficulty establishing ""just and proper cause"" for disciplining a union employee, the report said. No employees provided Saito with the materials that helped him escape, Attorney General Russell Suzuki said. Hawaii Health Director Bruce Anderson said Wednesday that part of the problem was that hospital staff members were complacent about Saito's escape risk. ""That's an embarrassment,"" Green said.

Law enforcement learned that the teen had been out jogging on Dec. 2 when a person she described as a Hispanic male came near her, the Brazoria County Sheriff’s Office said on Facebook. The individual had been driving a tan, 4-door Chevrolet Silverado truck made in the early 2000s, authorities said. The girl claimed that the male “stopped and got out of the truck and wrapped his arms around her,” prompting her to yell for help, authorities said. She managed to free herself after the pair crashed to the ground, after which he fled the scene in his vehicle, the sheriff’s office said. NEW JERSEY MAN IN LOVE TRIANGLE ADMITS TO MURDERING ROMANTIC RIVAL, PROSECUTOR SAYS On Dec. 5 investigators from the sheriff’s office went to the scene of the incident and while they were there, they spotted a vehicle that matched the one that had been described as the suspect’s, authorities said. When the driver – identified as suspect Steven Salazar – noticed the investigators, he allegedly tried to leave the area before being stopped by a sheriff’s office patrol unit, according to the post. “Salazar fit the description given of the attempted abductor, however, he denied having any contact with the victim or any involvement with the incident,” the sheriff’s office said. He was then arrested for reckless driving, and would also face a charge of evading arrest in a vehicle, the post said. FLORIDA MAN SET TO BE EXECUTED FOR WOMAN’S 1992 KILLING “Investigators were able to positively identify Steven Salazar as being the male that attempted to abduct the 15-year-old victim on Sunday, December 2,” the sheriff’s office said. “Investigators again interviewed Salazar and he gave several inconsistent stories about the incident.” Salazar was at his home in Alvin, Texas on Dec. 11 when authorities arrived and took him into custody for attempted kidnapping, following which he was booked into the Brazoria County Jail on a $20,000 bond, the sheriff’s office said. The Brazoria County Jail confirmed to Fox News that Salazar remained in custody on Thursday. Authorities are continuing to investigate the incident, the post said."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Serial killer pleads guilty in Texas woman's 1994 death	"A 78-year-old prisoner who says he killed about 90 people over nearly four decades as he moved around the country pleaded guilty to murder Thursday in the 1994 strangulation of a Texas woman. Samuel Little entered his plea in the West Texas city of Odessa, where the body of Denise Christie Brothers was discovered in a vacant lot about a month after she disappeared. He received another life prison term, Ector County District Attorney Bobby Bland said in a statement. ""Due to the efforts of law enforcement agencies from around the country, dozens of victims' families now have answers,"" Bland said. ""Although this is a conviction in Ector County, Texas, I hope it will serve as justice for all those atrocious murders committed across this nation in this unprecedented era of terror and mayhem caused by Samuel Little."" Little was convicted in 2014 of killing three Los Angeles-area women in separate attacks in the late 1980s and was serving life sentences when authorities say he confessed this year to killing dozens more people in 20 states since 1970. Those confessions, which often included a level of detail and recall that authorities say was uncanny, spurred investigators from Florida to California to review old murder cases. An FBI spokesman said thus far, investigators have concluded that Little was the killer in 36 cases, including the killing of Brothers and the three in the Los Angeles-area that landed him in prison. But Bland said in his statement more than 40 cases have been confirmed. He later explained that he received that number from Texas Rangers, an elite investigative agency that has relayed details of Little's confessions to law officers in other states. Little explained the killings in a series of conversations with Ranger James Holland. Most recently, police in Tennessee linked Little to the death of Martha Cunningham, a Knoxville woman whose body was found in a wooded area by a road in 1975. Even though Cunningham was bruised and nude from the waist down when her body was found, detectives attributed her death to natural causes, according to the Knoxville News Sentinel. With at least three-dozen confirmed deaths, Little is already among the most prolific known serial killers in American history. Gary Ridgway, the so-called Green River killer who is serving life in prison, pleaded guilty to killing 49 women and girls, making him the deadliest serial killer in terms of confirmed kills, though he has said he likely killed more than 71 people. Ted Bundy confessed to 30 homicides from about 1974 to 1978 and John Wayne Gacy killed at least 33 young men and boys in the 1970s. Both of them were executed. Little, who is in poor health and relies on a wheelchair, offered his confessions as a bargaining chip to be moved from the Los Angeles County prison where he was being held, the FBI said last month. But Bland said Thursday that Little will return to California to serve his life term. Little, who also went by the name Samuel McDowell, targeted vulnerable women who were often involved in prostitution and addicted to drugs, authorities have said. Once a competitive boxer, he usually stunned or knocked out his victims with powerful punches before he strangled them while masturbating. ""With no stab marks or bullet wounds, many of these deaths were not classified as homicides but attributed to drug overdoses, accidents, or natural causes,"" the FBI said."	nonTerrorism	Crime
New Jersey man in love triangle admits to murdering romantic rival	"A New Jersey man stuck in a love triangle killed his 20-year-old romantic rival during a night of jealousy and rage that culminated in his pleading guilty to murder this week. Alan McGinnis, 27, pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in the death of Cody MacPherson, revealing during a plea hearing Monday that he stabbed the victim in the chest and neck inside a Pemberton home and shoved his body in the trunk of his car on September 24, 2017, Ocean County prosecutor Bradley Billhimer told the Asbury Park Press on Tuesday. McGinnis faces 30 years in prison without the possibility of parole. MacPherson's remains were found six months after the crime and — after a collaborative investigation between agencies within the state — McGinnis was arrested a month later. A grand jury indicted him in August. McGinnis' odd behavior after the fatal stabbing of Macpherson — including nonchalantly asking his cousin on the day of the murder for a tool to hide the body — was revealed by investigators. “Hey, do you have a shovel? I have a body in the trunk,"" Michael Weatherstone, a supervising assistant Ocean County prosecutor, recalled McGinnis asking his relative during an April hearing, according to the newspaper. He later dumped MacPherson's body in a wooded area about a mile away in Jackson. Weatherstone said MacPherson had been romantically involved with McGinnis’ ex-girlfriend and mother of his two children, Caitlyn Huertas, who was passed out on a couch after drinking on the night of the murder. Huertas and McGinnis also had an intimate relationship around that same time, a probable cause affidavit obtained by Patch in July states. “He was aware they had slept together in [a] motel the night of Sept. 22 to Sept. 23,"" Superior Court Judge Guy P. Ryan said during an earlier hearing. According to the affidavit, McGinnis told Huertas' relatives that he killed MacPherson ""because he was no good for [her] and believed that Cody was responsible for her being an unfit mother."" McGinnis will remain in Ocean County Jail while he waits to be officially sentenced."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Gathering offers hope for teen missing since parents' deaths	"A Wisconsin girl who investigators believe was kidnapped after her parents were killed two months ago is being honored in her hometown with a Christmas tree adorned with messages of hope for her safe return. Hundreds of people attended a gathering Wednesday evening in Barron to light a ""tree of hope"" for 13-year-old Jayme Closs. The middle school student hasn't been seen since before her parents, James and Denise Closs, were found fatally shot in their home on Oct. 15. ""We just pray every day and we just hope for her safe return,"" said her uncle, Mike Closs. Detectives have pursued thousands of tips, watched dozens of surveillance videos and spent countless hours searching for Jayme, but their efforts haven't yielded any suspects . Investigators believe Jayme was abducted. The 16-foot tree was erected at Riverview Middle School and decorated with messages such as ""Pray for Jayme"" and ""Bring Jayme Home."" The tree was lighted in blue, her favorite color, and green to symbolize missing child awareness. Barron County Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald told WEAU-TV that there have been no new breaks in the case, but he said the Wednesday event lifted his spirits. The gathering included songs, the release of lighted lanterns, and a message from Barron native and ""The Voice"" finalist Chris Kroeze. ""I haven't smiled in a long time, so this is awesome,"" Fitzgerald said. The event was coordinated by the school and by Hormel Foods and Jennie-O Turkey Store, which employed the Closs parents. ""May this tree of hope for Jayme, filled with shining lights, be a symbol to us, to our community, that the darker it gets, the brighter light of hope shines,"" the Rev. Ron Matthews said."	nonTerrorism	Crime
The Latest: Man gets 9 years in prison for plane sex assault	"The Latest on a man convicted of sexually assaulting a sleeping woman on a plane (all times local): A man has been sentenced to nine years in prison for sexually assaulting a sleeping woman during an overnight flight from Las Vegas to Detroit. Prabhu Ramamoorthy was sentenced Thursday in federal court in Detroit. He was jailed after being accused of molesting a woman on an overnight flight in January. The 23-year-old victim says he unzipped her pants, unbuttoned her shirt and molested her with his hands while she slept.

Recalled California judge asks for help to pay legal debt	"A California judge who was recalled after sentencing a former Stanford student to six months in jail for sexually assaulting a young woman is asking people to donate money so he can pay court-ordered attorney's fees to the backers of the recall. Former Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky — the first state judge to be recalled in nearly a century — is asking supporters to donate to his failed campaign before the end of the year, the Mercury News reported Wednesday. ""My campaign committee has spent all its resources fighting the recall, and now must pay $135,000 to satisfy the attorney fees order, which is due by December 31,"" Persky said in the email titled ""A Final Ask."" Persky raised more than $840,000, but spent it all to try to keep his seat on the bench, which he lost in June when a majority of Santa Clara County voters chose to remove him. Stanford University law school professor Michele Dauber, who launched the recall campaign, said the judge only has himself to blame for his financial predicament. ""Judge Persky made the bad decision to repeatedly file frivolous lawsuits and appeals with the goal of stalling and causing expense,"" Dauber said in an email. The recall came after Persky sentenced former Stanford student Brock Turner, who was released from jail in 2016 after serving three months. The sentence sparked outrage among people who felt it was too lenient and Persky was targeted for the recall. Persky could not be reached for comment about his request for donations. One of his major donors defended his efforts. ""I hope this works out for him. He's been punished more than enough,"" said James McManis, whose law firm represented Persky for free."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Lawyer wants prison for detective who punched handcuffed man	"The attorney for a black Tennessee man whose beating by a white sheriff's officer while he was handcuffed was caught on video said at a Thursday news conference the officer should be fired immediately and then prosecuted. Lee Merritt told reporters in Chattanooga that Charles Toney suffered injuries including a collapsed lung and broken ribs when officers arrested him Dec. 3 on an outstanding warrant. In a video posted to social media, detective Blake Kilpatrick can be seen punching and kicking a handcuffed Toney, an aspiring rapper who goes by the stage name Interstate Tax. Merritt, flanked by Toney, community members, pastors and a representative of the NAACP, said the assault is part of a pattern of abuse. Merritt said the tactical force sent to arrest Toney was in itself an excessive use of force because Toney already had an agreement with the prosecutor's office to turn himself in. As it was, he was out of jail within hours of his arrest after paying a $250 bond, Merritt said. Kilpatrick is on desk duty pending an investigation by the U.S. Justice Department. Asked for comment Thursday, sheriff's office spokesman Matt Lea said in an email, ""At present, we prefer to allow the investigative process time to work and defer to the Department of Justice."" The sheriff's office did not immediately respond to a question about Kilpatrick's personnel file, but Merritt said at the news conference that the officer has been ""moved from department to department because of his history of violence."" Kilpatrick is named as a defendant in a federal civil rights case concerning the 2017 shooting death of a driver who fled from officers. Merritt referred to that case when he told reporters, ""We don't only want this man's badge; we want him behind bars where he belongs."""	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Kentucky man now charged with 3 murders, shooting at lawman"	"A man accused of shooting at a state police trooper rushing to the scene of a triple slaying has been charged in the murders of an eastern Kentucky couple and their adult son, police said Thursday. Investigators connected the slayings and the attack on the trooper to Paul Douglas Sizemore, who was captured Wednesday. Information gathered from the initial investigation led police to charge Sizemore with three murder counts, said Kentucky State Police Master Trooper Jody Sims. Sizemore was questioned by police after his capture while walking down the middle of a road. State police didn't immediately offer a possible motive or say whether Sizemore knew the victims. Sizemore, 52, also is charged with attempted murder of a police officer. He has a court appearance scheduled for Tuesday in Leslie County, court officials said. There was no paperwork indicating he has an attorney, officials said. Sizemore fled on foot Monday evening after allegedly ramming his car into a police cruiser and shooting at the trooper, state police said. The trooper, Ethan Lewis, wasn't injured. Deputies soon discovered the bodies, but Sizemore hid in the woods and wasn't found until two days later. He was unarmed and put up no resistance when officers found him walking on a road a few miles (kilometers) from where the slayings occurred. He complained of his feet hurting from exposure to cold weather. His capture ended a search on foot and by air in a heavily wooded, hilly area of eastern Kentucky. ""I'd say he was worn out,"" Sims said in a phone interview. Shortly before his capture, Sizemore knocked on the door of a home, telling the person who answered that he needed to warm up and needed dry socks, Sims said. Sizemore wasn't allowed in and wandered off. The person contacted state police and Sizemore was soon found. ""They did speak with him for some time, so it appeared that he was, at least to some degree, being cooperative with questions that were being asked by detectives,"" Sims said. Sizemore, now held in the Leslie County Detention Center, was charged in the slayings of 64-year-old Larry Bowling, his 61-year-old wife, Norma, and their 38-year-old son, Chad Bowling. The couple's bodies were found Monday evening in their home, and their son was found dead outside a neighboring home in the Appalachian community of Yeaddiss. All three had been shot, police said. County Coroner Greg Walker told the Lexington Herald-Leader that Larry Bowling had worked as a coal-mine foreman, and that he and his wife were ""just fine citizens."""	nonTerrorism	Crime
89-year-old Alabama woman jailed over messy appliance store	"Odean Cleckler, 89, said she has been doing her best to help run her husband's used-appliance business since he died a decade ago. This week, that work landed her and her son in jail. City officials arrested the pair for disobeying a court order to clean up Cleckler's Appliance and Parts, which is surrounded by hundreds of old stoves, refrigerators, washers and dryers along a main road in town. Friends are now volunteering to help clean up around the store, but Cleckler said it's not that easy. ""I appreciate them, but I got a guy here who knows what to throw away and what to keep,"" she said in an interview Thursday. ""That's my business and I've been doing it for years."" Clecker's husband Reuben Clecker died in 2008 after decades in the appliance business in Clanton, a rural town of about 8,700 people located roughly halfway between Birmingham and Montgomery. Responsibility for the shop fell on his widow and son Randy Cleckler, 64. Located near the town's Walmart store, it's hard to miss the Clecklers' shop. Old appliances line the front of the business, and hundreds more sit on the ground in rows behind the shop. City officials contend the appliances are both an eyesore and a health risk since the old machines hold standing water that can serve as a maternity ward for mosquitoes. A municipal judge acting at the city's request ordered the business to clean up, but nothing happened. That resulted in both mother and son being put in jail after a court session on Tuesday, a move Mayor Billy Joe Driver said he regretted. ""I didn't want her in jail, just putting it like it is,"" Driver told WBMA-TV. Randy Cleckler remains in the Chilton County Jail under a 30-day sentence, but records show his mom got out on a court order after spending what she said was her first night ever behind bars. ""It was an old hard floor with a pillow under my head. It wasn't fun, but I survived it,"" she said. Driver said Randy Cleckler did ""absolutely nothing"" to remove the old appliances, leaving officials with no choice but to act. The mayor said appliances began piling up at the store following Reuben Cleckler's death in 2008. ""Mr. Cleckler didn't have all those. He would move out the older ones and sell of some off some of them,"" said Driver. The minimum dumping charge at the county landfill is $12, and Odean Cleckler said people bring her old appliances that the shop uses for parts. She said she's trying to both honor the city's wishes and help customers who prefer fixing their appliances to purchasing new ones. ""If someone needs a part that we can pull off an appliance we do that to help them out,"" she said."	nonTerrorism	Crime

7-foot ex-high school basketball star accused of raping 18-year-old woman	"A 7-foot-tall former Kentucky high school basketball star -- who's the son of an ex-NFL offensive lineman -- was arrested Tuesday for allegedly raping and sexually assaulting an 18-year-old woman, police said. College basketball prospect Jacob Walter, listed at 7-feet tall and weighing 300 pounds, allegedly committed the crimes throughout the day Sunday, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer. The woman told Boone County Sheriff’s detectives that Walter forcefully raped her and sodomized her, officials said. “It did occur throughout the majority of the day beginning in the morning hours and ending in the evening hours,” a Boone County official told WAVE-3. “They were amicably together, but she did not want to have any kind of sexual contact with him that day.” The woman said she was fearful of Walter, the 18-year-old son of former Cincinnati Bengals tackle Joe Walter, and didn’t want to have sex with him because she felt sick, Boone County officials said. Walter sodomized the woman while holding her down and pulling her hair, officials said. He allegedly caused physical injuries including contusions to her right breast and a laceration to her chest, according to the Enquirer. Walter was ordered to stay away from the victim and her family and was being held on $250,000 cash bond at the Boone County Detention Center. Walter was a standout basketball player at Covington Catholic High School and once earned a scholarship offer from Xavier University -- but as of August 2018 he wasn’t on the roster and he never enrolled at the school, the Enquirer reported."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Indiana police officer dies after car slams into tree during high-speed pursuit	"A police officer in southern Indiana was killed Wednesday night after his squad car slammed into a tree during a high-speed pursuit that spanned two counties, officials said.

Threesome twist revealed during testimony in Denise Williams murder trial	"The murder trial against Denise Williams – who allegedly helped stage her husband’s death as a boating mishap – revealed a twisted web of extramarital affairs that included threesomes, according to court testimony. Denise Williams, 48, faced the second day of testimony Wednesday in her trial for allegedly conspiring to kill her 31-year-old spouse, Mike Williams, who vanished in December 2000 on a duck hunting trip at Lake Seminole in Florida. Prosecutors allege Denise was involved in an affair with Mike’s best friend, Brian Winchester, and they plotted to kill her husband so they could be together. The pair is accused of staging Mike’s disappearance and collecting on his $1.75 million life insurance. Mike, Denise and Winchester were close friends and attended North Florida Christian School together, along with Winchester’s wife, Kathy Thomas, according to officials. Both couples were high school sweethearts and would go on double-dates – even after they each married in 1994 and had children.

Man with child porn stash in treehouse in woods gets nine months in jail	"A man from Washington state was sentenced to nine months behind bars last week after federal officials found a child pornography stash in his illegally built ""fairy"" treehouse on federal land. Daniel Wood, 57, pleaded guilty Nov. 20 to one count of second-degree possession of child pornography and one count of second-degree attempted viewing of child pornography, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported. A U.S. Department of Natural Resources employee had heard rumors in the hiking community about a cabin built illegally in the Snoqualmie National Forest, about 50 miles east of Seattle. The federal employee tried unsuccessfully to locate the cabin himself five times in 2016, according to an FBI report. The home was known to the U.S. Forest Service for seven years and had last been examined by the agency three years earlier. After finding the tree house in November 2016, the employee found framed images of child pornography mounted on the walls, including a montage of five large photos displayed across a bed. He took some photos and brought them to the King County Sheriff’s Office, according to the PI. The remote structure featured a porch surrounding the home and a ladder that hung about 8 feet off the ground. In 2017, the FBI searched the cabin and found dozens of photos of young girls fastened to the walls. Several items were taken that contained DNA samples and fingerprints that matched Woods. Authorities seized thousands of child porn images and videos at Wood’s home in Mill Creek in February of this year. Many matched photos that appeared to be printed out, taped together and hung in the cabin. One sheriff’s detective described the cabin as an ""an elaborate treehouse that resembled a fairy or gingerbread house.” As part of his sentence, Woods will not be allowed to have contact with children without supervision for 10 years, must register as a sex offender and undergo sexual deviancy treatment."	nonTerrorism	Crime

Bail reduced for mother of New Mexico infant shot in face	"A judge on Wednesday reduced bail for the mother of an 8-month-old girl who police say was shot in the face at a New Mexico motel. Following a hearing, New Mexico State District Judge Robert Baca decided to decrease the bond for Shayanne Nelson from $50,000 to $20,000. Nelson, 18, was arrested after telling police she was in a Gallup motel shower with her boyfriend, Tyrell Bitsilly, 21, when her 3-year-old boy found a gun and accidentally shot the infant. Nelson said she believed the gun was left in the room by a prior occupant. Nelson and Bitsilly are facing child abuse charges. Bitsilly also was charged with tampering with evidence. He remained held on $70,000 bond. It was not clear if Nelson had posted bail. Her attorney, Teresa Gomez, didn't answer her phone and her voicemail wasn't accepting messages.

"South Carolina teen pleads guilty to murdering father, 6-year-old-boy"	"A South Carolina teen could face life in prison after he pleaded guilty Wednesday to murdering his father and a six-year-old boy. Jesse Osborne was 14 when he shot and killed his father, Jeffrey, in their home on Sept. 28, 2016. According to a confession he gave following his arrest, Osborne shot his father in the head three times as he sat in a chair. Investigators said he then drove his father’s pickup truck three miles to Townville Elementary School in Anderson County where he opened fire on a group of students playing outside for recess. Jacob Hall, 6, was shot in the leg and died three days later. Osborne, now 16, entered a guilty plea Wednesday with no deal. He could face anywhere between 30 years and life in prison when he is sentenced at a later date. The U.S. Supreme Court allows a life sentence without parole for suspects who are juveniles when they kill someone only in the most heinous of cases. Prosecutors said Osborne talked about the shooting on social media in the days leading up to the killings. He considered shooting students at his middle school where he had been suspended earlier that fall for bringing a hatchet and machete. ""The middle school has tons of cops,"" he said in the chat group six days before shooting. ""The elementary school doesn't."" Osborne told investigators he was angry at his father because he would get drunk and berate and try to fight his mother and him. The teen also said in his confession that he was bullied.

Mom whose toddler was yanked by police resolves another case	"A mother who was violently separated from her toddler by New York police in a widely viewed videotaped encounter agreed on Wednesday to do community service to resolve a separate legal case. A judge told Jazmine Headley, 23, that the charges will be dropped in her credit card fraud case in New Jersey if she successfully completes an intervention program. Judge Peter Warshaw said Headley will have to pay back about $1,000. Her agreement also includes 20 hours of community service. ""I'm just happy to be reunited with my son,"" Headley said outside the courthouse in Trenton. Headley faced two credit card theft charges and one count of trafficking in personal information, along with two other defendants who were not in court Wednesday. On Tuesday, Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez dismissed the charges against Headley relating to the benefits office tussle, saying he was ""horrified by the violence depicted"" in a bystander's video. She left a New York jail later that day. Mayor Bill de Blasio said it was ""deeply troubling"" and ""100 percent unacceptable."" The incident in the benefits office did not come up during her court appearance in New Jersey. The video captured the chaotic scene that unfolded last Friday as officers tried to remove Headley from the crowded office, where she had sat on the floor for two hours because of a lack of chairs. Police were called when she refused a security guard's order to leave. Headley ended up lying face-up on the floor during a tug-of-war over her 18-month-old son. Other clients shouted at the officers. At one point, an officer can be seen pulling her stun gun and pointing it at people in the angry crowd. Clients of the facility complained the episode was indicative of how the city treats social-services recipients. ""What happened to Jazmine Headley and her son Damone should never have happened,"" de Blasio, a Democrat, said Wednesday. ""It will not happen again."" The New York Police Department and the Department of Social Services are reviewing the incident. Two city employees have been placed on modified duty. The police officers involved remain on full, active duty. A police union representative said people should not rush to condemn officers, adding that the incident would have unfolded differently if those involved had complied with orders. On Wednesday, Headley appeared briefly outside the courthouse with her mother, Jacqueline Jenkins, and attorney Brian Neary. She appeared to be holding back tears. ""I'm happy to have my daughter and my grandson back,"" Jenkins said."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Mom arrested in video that sparked outrage freed from jail	"A mother jailed after police violently pulled her toddler son from her arms in a videotaped encounter in a crowded waiting room of a New York City social services office was released Tuesday night. ""I'm just so grateful to everyone and I'm just happy to be free and I just need to see my boy,"" Jazmine Headley said following her release from the Rikers Island jail facility. A judge had ordered her free just hours after Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said that ""in the interest of justice"" he was dropping all charges against Jazmine Headley in Friday's incident. Headley, who was being held on a warrant in an unrelated credit card fraud case in New Jersey, is due to appear in court Wednesday in that matter. Headley and two other people are accused of making or using a dozen credit cards printed with numbers and names that didn't match their magnetic strips and having a driver's license that didn't belong to them. In dropping the Brooklyn charges, Gonzalez said he was ""horrified by the violence depicted in the video,"" which showed officers yanking Headley's 18-month-old son from her arms. He said the situation should have been handled differently. ""The consequences this young and desperate mother has already suffered as a result of this arrest far outweigh any conduct that may have led to it: she and her baby have been traumatized, she was jailed on an unrelated warrant and may face additional collateral consequences,"" Gonzalez said in a statement. He said that continuing to pursue the charges — obstructing governmental administration, resisting arrest, endangering the welfare of a child and trespassing — ""will not serve any purpose and I therefore moved today to dismiss it immediately in the interest of justice."" The video, posted to social media by an onlooker, caused a furor, spurring outrage from those who say it's indicative of how social service recipients are treated. It showed Headley ending up lying face-up on the floor, and a police officer at another point pulling her stun gun out and aiming it at the upset crowd. Officials said the situation is being reviewed by the New York Police Department and the Department of Social Services. Two city employees have been placed on modified duty in connection to the incident."	nonTerrorism	Crime
New effort in Maryland to combat upsurge in fentanyl deaths	"A new effort in Maryland to prosecute more fentanyl cases in federal court is designed to help combat an alarming increase of fatalities caused by the potent synthetic opioid that's fueling the deadliest overdose epidemic in U.S. history. Fentanyl — a synthetic opioid both cheap to produce and up to 50 times more powerful than heroin — was the driving force behind Maryland's all-time high number of drug fatalities last year, rising from 1,119 in 2016 to 1,594 in 2017. But this year's projected total exceeds 2,000 deaths from fentanyl, a 25 percent increase from last year's grim milestone. To stem the surge in a state that already had one of the country's most severe opioid overdose mortality rates, U.S. Attorney for Maryland Robert Hur said ""every single arrest"" made by Baltimore police involving fentanyl distribution will now be jointly reviewed by U.S., state and city authorities to determine if they can be handled in the federal system. Federal time includes stiffer sentences, no parole, no suspended sentences and terms in prisons frequently far from home. ""I want word to get out far and wide: If you choose to sell fentanyl on the streets, then you run the very real risk of federal time,"" Hur said at a news conference in downtown Baltimore. There's no shortage of people selling fentanyl and fentanyl-laced drugs on the streets of Baltimore, where the large majority of Maryland's opioid deaths have occurred. Just this month, three Maryland men were indicted in federal court on charges they were involved in a conspiracy to distribute 400 grams of fentanyl trafficked by a group with ties to Mexican drug cartels. Todd Edwards, a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration's Baltimore district office, said fentanyl has become so ubiquitous that it's showing up in laced cocaine, marijuana and counterfeit prescription pills. ""You are actually seeing fentanyl coming into every single part of the drug war,"" Edwards said. The escalation in fentanyl fatalities comes as the hard-hit state is actually starting to see evidence of a dip in deadly heroin overdoses. Patrick Jennings, a prosecutor with the state's attorney's office in Baltimore, said ""it's very rare that we see heroin anymore."" Baltimore's interim police commissioner, Gary Tuggle, described the new collaborative effort as a strategic tool that will allow authorities to go after ""the worst of the worst"" — not small-time, nonviolent offenders. The DEA has said China is a main source of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids that have been flooding the U.S. market. The agency's National Drug Threat Assessment, released in early November, shows that heroin, fentanyl and other opioids continue to be the highest drug threat in the nation."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Christine Blasey Ford presents award to Larry Nassar victim in first appearance since Kavanaugh hearing	"For her first public appearance since she discussed Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's alleged sexual misconduct, Christine Blasey Ford presented an award to the first woman who came forward to accuse former sports doctor Larry Nassar of sexual assault. Ford introduced Rachael Denhollander, 34, in a video message before the lawyer and former gymnast was presented with the Sports Illustrated’s Inspiration of the Year award. “Rachael Denhollander, I am in awe of you, and I will always be inspired by you,” Ford said. “In stepping forward, you took a huge risk, and you galvanized future generations to come forward, even when the odds are seemingly stacked against them.” Denhollander sued Nassar in federal court and went public with her allegations during an interview with the Indianapolis Star in 2016. Denhollander said she had issues with her back and wrists as a teenage athlete, and Nassar would position himself so her mother couldn’t see what he was doing while he would assault her. “Nothing was off-limits for him,” she said then. CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD EXPLAINS USE OF GOFUNDME MONEY IN RARE PUBLIC STATEMENT Nassar worked for Michigan State University and the U.S. women’s Olympic gymnastics team. Hundreds of women and girls said Nassar sexually abused them under the guise of medical treatment throughout the years. The 55-year-old is serving effective life sentences for child porn possession and molesting young women and girls. While she was the first to publicly come forward, Denhollander was the last person who addressed Nassar during his sentencing hearing, offering her forgiveness. Just days before the Senate Judiciary Committee was set to vote on Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation earlier this year, Ford publicly came forward to accuse the judge of sexual misconduct decades ago. LARRY NASSAR VICTIM TO SPEAK AT HARVARD ABOUT FORGIVENESS She accused Kavanaugh of pinning her to a bed during a house party in Maryland in the early 1980s, attempting to remove her clothes and putting his hand over her mouth when she tried to scream. At the time of the alleged incident, Ford was 15 and Kavanaugh was 17, she said, claiming Kavanaugh was drunk. Kavanaugh repeatedly denied the allegations, and after a highly publicized and emotional hearing regarding the accusations, he was confirmed to the bench on Oct. 6. After the allegations, a GoFundMe account set up on Ford’s behalf raised $647,610 before it was closed to further donations. In a Nov. 21 statement posted to the fundraising page, Ford said she used the money “to protect ourselves against frightening threats, including physical protection and security for me and my family, and to enhance the security for our home.” Any leftover money will be donated to “organizations that support trauma survivors” – which are yet to be determined, Ford said.

Collection of nude photos of women found in ex-USC gynecologist's storage unit	"A collection of photographs showing nude women was discovered in a self-storage unit rented by Dr. George Tyndall, the former University of Southern California gynecologist accused of sexually abusing hundreds of students during examinations. The cache of images appeared to include homemade pornography – some of it decades old and featuring Tyndall with women apparently unconnected to the university – but also photos of unclothed women in what appeared to be a medical exam room, police Capt. Billy Hayes told the Los Angeles Times. Authorities found the photos last spring after they launched an investigation into Tyndall. They are now being used in the probe. The investigation is believed to be the “largest sex crimes investigation involving an individual in LAPD history,” the Los Angeles Times reported. The investigation is ongoing and the sex crimes unit of the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office will determine whether to file criminal charges. Tyndall, 71, resigned from his position last year. Hundreds of current and former USC students have made allegations against Tyndall to the university, filed police reports or taken part in at least a dozen pending state lawsuits against the school. In October, USC administrators agreed to settle a federal class-action suit on behalf of Tyndall’s patients for $215 million. Detectives are trying to determine whether any of the photographs found in the storage facility show patients at campus clinic appointments. Leonard Levine, the doctor’s lawyer, said in a statement that Tyndall has “never sold, traded or shared any images of patients he examined while conducting medical examinations at USC.” John Manly, an attorney representing many former Tyndall patients, told the Times that between 10 and 20 of his clients were asked questions by police that seemed designed to identify them in photos. ""This plays into the worst nightmares of women,"" Manly said. USC said it was cooperating with the investigation. The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Crime
North Carolina deputy on leave after viral video appears to show him tackling teen sisters	"A North Carolina sheriff’s deputy was placed on administrative leave after a viral video appeared to show him tackling teenage sisters to the ground. The Harnett County Sheriff’s Office asked the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation to investigate, WTVD reported. The deputy involved wasn't identified. The incident unfolded Monday, when two deputies were called to a house in Sanford after a complaint concerning “illegal drug activity,” the station reported. The deputies said they smelled marijuana coming from a car parked outside the residence and, after investigating, allegedly found a gun under the driver’s seat and learned the man in the car had active warrants. A video posted on Facebook showed the man asking the deputy why he was “being detained.” The person filming, a 17-year-old girl, was heard saying to the deputy, “You said he’s being detained because he’s being jittery? That’s what I heard you say.” A few moments later, the teenager’s 14-year-old sister was seen telling the deputy he couldn’t take her phone. One of the deputies is then seen slamming the teenager to the ground. “Yo, what are you doing right now? She didn’t do anything. Why are you doing that? What did she do?” the teenager filming asked. The deputy was heard telling the 14-year-old she was under arrest. A few moments later the deputy turned his focus to the other sister as she tried to pick up her sister’s phone and tackled her to the ground. “This is evidence,” the deputy was heard saying regarding the cellphone. “Ow! I didn’t do anything,” the girl replied. “I did absolutely nothing, sir.” The sisters were not taken into custody, ABC News reported. The 17-year-old told WTVD she was “disgusted” by the incident. She told WTVD she “strained her back” and is “in pain right now.” ""I understand that they...felt like they were doing their job, but there's a different way it could have been approached,"" she said."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"6 people beat, poured scalding water on boy, 3, at New Jersey house"	"A 3-year-old boy was ""severely"" beaten and abused -- including being burned with scalding water -- by six adults, in a consistent and coordinated form of punishment, New Jersey officials said. Patricia Gamarra, 62, Mary Buchan, 55, Patricia Buchan, 28, Bridget Buchan, 23, Natacha Smith, 43, and Homer Searcy, 39, were arrested and charged with aggravated assault and endangering the welfare of the toddler, Essex County Prosecutor’s Office said in a statement Wednesday. Smith is the 3-year-old boy’s mother, though it’s unclear if the five others have any relation to the child. The six people were living in the home in Newark, about 9 miles from New York City. They allegedly beat the toddler with their fists and belts and poured scalding water on him “as a form of corporal punishment.” Authorities did not reveal what information led them to investigate the house of horror. The six people are being held at the Essex County Correctional Facility and expected to make their first court appearance on Thursday. It’s unclear what the child’s condition was as of Wednesday."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Body cam video captures moment police officer stops teen from jumping in front of train	"An Illinois police officer was able to tackle a suicidal teenage girl just moments before she would have been hit by an approaching train, stunning body camera footage showed. Waukegan police released footage Monday showing the moments leading up to the dramatic rescue. In the video, no one appears to be in the area as the officers, searching for a suicidal teen, approach the train tracks -- but as soon as the crossing gates are activated by the approaching train, a young woman comes out from behind the railroad mechanical shed. After the girl disobeyed officers' commands to stop, one of the cops jumps into action, tackling the 17-year-old girl before she could step in front of the train. “I am extremely proud of these officers who, through their heroic actions, saved the life of a young woman,” Chief Wayne Walles said in a statement. Officials said they received a call Friday at about 1:40 a.m. from a woman who said her teenage sister was going to take her own life by standing in front of an oncoming train. Dispatchers were able to locate the girl by “pinging” her cellphone. “I am just so proud of our dispatch who utilized their resources to locate the area where this young woman was and directed the responding officers to find her,” Walles said. AS DOCTORS TAPER OR END OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS, MANY PATIENTS DRIVEN TO DESPAIR, SUICIDE Police said the girl was taken to the hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. Joe Florip, a spokesman for the Waukegan Police Department, told the Chicago Tribune they released the photo because they recognize mental health is a huge issue. “We thought this might be a huge catalyst for people who need help to get some help,” he said. ""That’s why we included the suicide hotline number in the press release.” He added: “We are also very proud of our police and dispatchers for the work they do on a daily basis. Sometimes the public doesn’t realize these are the type of things they are asked to do.”"	nonTerrorism	Crime
Convicted child abuser attacks prosecutors in Nevada courtroom at sentencing	"A Nevada sentencing hearing descended into chaos last week when a man convicted of child abuse attacked prosecutors after learning how long he'd be spending behind bars. The incident, caught on video, shows Terhain Woods in a Las Vegas courtroom after his conviction for beating a 13-month-old boy in March 2017. A judge tells Woods he'd be sentenced to between 8-to-10 years in prison plus an additional 1-to-3 years, which Woods doesn't seem to understand. “So how many years is that?” Woods could be heard saying off-camera. Woods then can be seen lunging at the prosecutors in the courtroom before being restrained by several officers. “This was a violent outburst,” Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson told FOX5. “This was an attack. He tried to physically hurt my prosecutors.” MAKING SUSPECTS SIT ON GROUND IS ‘DEMEANING,’ SAN FRANCISCO POLICE CHIEF SAYS Woods had acted out during his trial, which prompted a contingent of corrections officers to attend his sentencing, according to FOX5. Woods' lawyer, Michael Troiano, told FOX5, his client suffers from mental health issues and wouldn't have hurt anyone in the courtroom. “He just had a freak out and just wanted to cause havoc,” he said. Wolfson told FOX5 he doesn't think Woods will face any more charges for the outburst in court because his sentence is already a long one."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Family of Florida woman who died on first date claim she was left for dead on interstate	"The family of a Florida woman who reportedly died Friday after falling off a motorcycle during a first date claims her date left her for dead on an interstate, reports said. Jennifer St. Clair, 33, was found dead around 3 a.m. near an Interstate 95 exit in Pompano Beach, West Palm Beach's WPBF-TV reported. The man she was on a date with left her on the road to die, the victim's family said, according to the station. ""We don't know how anybody could do something like that. It's the hardest part,"" Amy Gamer, the victim's aunt, said. Authorities said she had been struck by several cars while lying on the roadway, the report said. Her date picked her up on Thursday night around 10 p.m., the family told The Miami Herald. “That’s all the family knows, that she was on a date with a fellow. They believe they met online somehow,” the family’s attorney, Todd Falzone, told the paper. “Two other couples, who were also on motorcycles, also went along.” The family believes she fell off while they were returning from the date. Florida Highway Patrol officials said St. Clair's death is being investigated as a traffic homicide, the paper reported.  Several drivers accidentally ran over the victim around 1:30 a.m., the report said. Some witnesses said they saw a man on a motorcycle standing near the victim's body and then took off, The Herald reported. That storyline matches what authorities said, according to the family. St. Clair worked as a server in restaurants and lived in Fort Lauderdale with her parents, The South Florida Sun-Sentinel reported. Pompano Beach, where her body was found, is about 11 miles north of Fort Lauderdale. “She was surrounded by a big family who loves her so much,” Gamber told the paper of her niece. “We’re still trying to process all of this.”"	nonTerrorism	Crime
"New Mexico toddler shoots infant in face in motel room; mother, boyfriend face charges"	" A New Mexico couple is facing charges after an unsupervised 3-year-old boy accidentally shot his 8-month-old sister in the face Saturday while the children's mom and her boyfriend were in the shower, police said. The baby was taken to the hospital and remains in critical condition. Shayanne Nelson, 18, and her boyfriend, Tyrell Bitsilly, 21, face child abuse charges after the shooting inside a motel room on Route 66 in Gallup, located 140 miles west of Albuquerque, police said. Nelson and Bitsilly were reportedly in the shower when the toddler discovered the gun and pulled the trigger, striking his sister in the face. Police were called to the motel, where they found an adult holding a baby with a gunshot wound to her face, the complaint filed Monday said. Nelson told police she didn’t know the weapon was in the room and believed it may have been left there by the last motel guest -- though another hotel guest told officials they saw Bitsilly cleaning the gun after the near-fatal shooting. Along with the child abuse charge, Bitsilly was also charged with tampering with evidence. Court records show Nelson was released on a $5,000 unsecured bond. Bitsilly was ordered held on a $70,000 bond. The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Pastor held in murder of transgender woman	"A Detroit pastor was charged Monday in the murder of a transgender woman, as authorities revealed that her gender status played a role in her fatal shooting. Albert Weathers, 46, of Sterling Heights, was charged with murder in the death of Kelly Stough, 36, who was found dead on a Detroit street Friday. Evidence about how Stough's transgender status had a role will be presented in court, according to the Wayne County prosecutor's office said. Spokeswoman Maria Miller declined to offer further comment. The Associated Press left a message with Weathers' lawyer seeking comment. Dana Nessel, Michigan's next attorney general, said the case reflects the ""excessive brutality"" faced by a member of Detroit's transgender community. Nessel is also president of Fair Michigan, a group committed to equal protection for gay, lesbian and transgender residents. ""You keep fighting, keep pushing and live your life. ...

"Making suspects sit on ground is ‘demeaning,’ San Francisco police chief "	"Police officers in San Francisco may no longer demand that suspects – whether handcuffed or not – sit on the ground or sidewalk at a crime scene, the city’s police chief writes in a department memo. The practice is viewed as “demeaning” to suspects, city police Chief William Scott has determined, according to the Bay Area’s FOX 2. SAN FRANCISCO COPS FIRE 65 SHOTS IN 15 SECONDS AT MURDER SUSPECT IN DRAMATIC VIDEO The change is “aligned with 21st century policing, our department values and our commitment to providing safety with respect to everyone whom our officers encounter,” a police department spokesman told FOX 2. “In order to carry out duties respectfully and professionally, sitting a subject on the ground or sidewalk should be done only as a last resort and only when necessary,” the chief’s memo says. The chief recommends instead that officers place suspects “secured in a police vehicle” when “sufficient help is on the scene.” In times of “exceptional circumstances,” such as when a suspect is resisting arrest, officers may have no choice but to take a suspect to the ground, the chief acknowledges. Whenever that happens, however, the chief wants to know about it. “Officer shall document, in an incident report, anytime it is necessary to seat an individual on the ground,” the chief writes. The memo does not mention any specific incidents as having prompted the policy statement. Scott became the city’s police chief in January 2017 after serving 27 years in the Los Angeles Police Department, according to his official San Francisco Police Department biography. SUSPECT WHO DIED AFTER SHOOTOUT WITH POLICE WAS ON PROBATION FOR ARMED ROBBERY, REPORT SAYS Earlier this month, a study by the University of California at Berkeley credited an increase in foot patrols by San Francisco police with helping to reduce crime in the city. The city reassigned about 3.5 percent of its officers to foot patrols in summer 2017, and saw drops in assaults, larceny and vehicle thefts, the study said, according to the Daily Californian. But the department has also seen its share of turmoil. Last week the family of a 21-year-old man – who was killed by a San Francisco police officer in 2016 -- filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the city, the San Francisco Examiner reported. The suit alleges that police overreacted to a situation at a barbershop instead of using de-escalation tactics being encouraged since 2016, the report said."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Family pleads guilty to stealing more than $2M in tax refunds from IRS	"Three members of a Las Vegas family who conspired to steal more than $2 million in income tax refunds from the IRS using made-up businesses and the identity of a dead brother have pleaded guilty, the U.S. Department of Justice said Tuesday. Chanh V. Trinh, Cannedy Trinh and Elizabeth Trinh reported false withholdings and payments when they filed federal corporate and individual income tax returns, KSNV-TV reported. The three family members filed the returns under the names of fictional businesses, their own names and the names of others, including Chanh’s deceased brother. Chanh prepared and filed the returns himself, while all three family members deposited or cashed the refund checks, the station reported. They used various bank accounts and check-cashing businesses in the area. The Trinh family masked the stolen funds by buying cashiers’ checks and exchanging them for gambling chips at Las Vegas casinos, KTNV-TV reported. When IRS-Criminal Investigation special agents finally caught the Trinhs, more than $2 million in fraudulent refunds had been paid out by the agency on more than $6 million in false claims filed, KSNV-TV reported. Chanh, who also pleaded guilty to aggravated identity theft for using his dead brother’s name, will be sentenced to eight and a half years under the plea agreements, KTNV-TV reported. Cannedy will face two years in prison, while Elizabeth faces a maximum sentence of 10 years under their plea deals. The court must accept the plea agreements at a sentencing hearing scheduled for April. The Trinh family will also face a period of supervised release, restitution and monetary penalties, KSNV-TV reported"	nonTerrorism	Crime

Frank Miles Is A Reporter Editor Covering Geopolitics Military Crime Technology Sports For Foxnews Com His Email Is Frank Miles Foxnews Com	"Emma Coronel Aispuro, the 29-year-old wife of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán and the mother of their twin 7-year-old daughters, claimed in a rare interview that the media have given her husband a bad rap: she said he’s normal and ordinary, and not an infamous horror media fabrication. “They don’t want to bring him down from the pedestal to make him more like he is, a normal, ordinary person,” the former beauty queen told the Spanish-language network Telemundo about the media’s “unfair” portrayal of “El Chapo.” The interview aired Monday evening; it was unclear where it took place. “I think he did like it, he does like it a little,” Aispuro added about the media attention’s effect on her 61-year-old husband who has been on trial in federal court in Brooklyn since Nov. 13. Aispuro has been dubbed the Kim Kardashian doppelgänger of Mexico — a beauty queen fond of flaunting her designer dresses, oversized sunglasses and bikini body for a growing flock of followers across social media. CRUELTY OF EL CHAPO'S SINALOA CARTEL KNOWS NO BOUNDS The notorious drug lord has been denied contact with his wife as a security measure since being brought to New York City to face drug conspiracy charges. During the trial, witnesses have described how her husband used tunnels dug under the border and fake jalapeno cans to smuggle tons of cocaine into the United States during the 1990s and early 2000s. The Sinaloa cartel, sometimes referred to by insiders as ""The Federation,"" made hundreds of millions of dollars, most of it in U.S. currency collected in such volume it had to be stashed in safe houses while the gang figured out what to do with it. Guzmán spent some of it on a private zoo, a diamond-encrusted pistol and paying off police and politicians. Aispuro has been trying to humanize her husband who allegedly runs the multibillion-dollar cartel that continues to operate from Mexico and throughout the United States. “That’s what he really wants,” she added to Telemundo. “For everyone to realize how things really are and see it all from another perspective. More than anything, I think that’s what he wants. Just tell it like it is.” She said she is happy to stand by her man during his trial, and she told Telemundo she is looking forward to the future. “I don’t dream of big things,” Aispuro said. “Tranquility, happiness, nothing out of the ordinary.” Fox News’ Hollie McKay and The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Florida woman accused of plotting husband's death, marrying killer stands trial"	"The trial of a Florida woman accused of plotting the murder of her husband in 2000 and marrying his killer, with whom she was said to be having an affair, began Tuesday. Denise Williams, 48, is facing a first-degree murder charge in the suspicious death of her husband, Mike Williams, who had disappeared while duck hunting on a large lake near Tallahassee nearly 20 years ago. Investigators said they initially believed he fell from his boat and alligators ate him. However, years later his best friend and insurance agent, Brian Winchester, confessed to the killing, adding that Williams’ wife was in on it. Investigators ultimately concluded the man had died from a shotgun blast to the head and had been buried near the lake. Winchester testified Tuesday about his relationship with Denise Williams. He claimed Mike Williams apparently was growing suspicious about her activities. Winchester said that suspicion and the fact that one of Mike Williams' insurance policies was about to lapse led him and Denise to kill him. ""We knew our window of opportunity was closing,"" Winchester testified. Philip Padovano, one of the attorneys representing Denise Williams, said there was no proof his client was having an affair with Winchester or had helped plot the killing. ""There's no tangible evidence or physical evidence to connect Denise Williams to this crime."" Winchester said he had intended to drown Mike Williams by pushing him from his canoe, but panicked when he saw Williams struggling in the water to get out of his jacket and duck waders and shot him. He said he dragged Williams' body back to shore, put him in his truck and buried him hours later. At the time of his death, Williams had three life insurance policies worth $1.75 million. Denise Williams initially petitioned to have him declared dead due to accidental drowning because crews hadn't found the body. She married Winchester in December 2005, but the relationship soured and they divorced in 2016. Last year, Winchester pleaded no contest to kidnapping his ex-wife at gunpoint, and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. The very next day, officials announced that Mike Williams' remains were found at the end of a dead-end road after they received ""new information."" The body had been discovered two months earlier, but the state's Department of Law Enforcement needed to confirm through DNA tests that it actually was Williams. The woman’s defense team told the jury: ""You will have to rely on the word of a murderer and a convicted felon."" She also faces charges including conspiracy to commit murder and accessory after the fact. The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Houston shooting suspect dead after 5-hour standoff with police, 3 officers injured"	"A man accused of shooting three Texas officers has died from an apparent “self-inflicted gunshot wound” after a standoff that lasted over five hours, law-enforcement officials announced Tuesday. Five agents with the Fugitive Apprehension Unit -- part of the state attorney general's office -- and two investigators with the sheriff’s office were attempting to serve a felony warrant to 25-year-old Daniel Trevino at approximately 12:50 p.m. local time, Chief Deputy Edison Toquica with the Harris County Sheriff’s Office said. While at the door of the home, Trevino fired at officers who then returned fire, Toquica said during a news briefing earlier. One deputy and two AG's officers were injured during the shootout. Trevino barricaded himself inside the home for over five hours, police said. During that time law enforcement was able to establish multiple lines of communication with Trevino. Toquica said the suspect agreed to come out but instead fired at officers three more times. He said at approximately 6:15 p.m., police discovered that Trevino died from a “self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.” “We work hard every day to be sure that these type of situations end in a peaceful manner,” Toquica said at a later news conference. “Today was an exception to that.” TEENS 'SEVERELY' HURT AFTER FALLING OFF BORDER WALL, U.S. SAYS He extended his “thoughts and prayers” to the injured officers who are expected to survive, adding that they are facing a “long recovery.” One officer with the AG’s office was shot in the torso and leg while the other was shot in the foot, The Houston Chronicle reported. The deputy was struck in the hand and likely will lose a finger as a result of his injury, the news report said.

Rusty Counts, 39, of Anchor Point, shot the moose near his community over two weeks in September. He pleaded guilty Nov. 6 to 21 misdemeanor wildlife counts and violations, including wanton waste, exceeding bag limits and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Hunting regulations near the Kenai Peninsula community require moose to have antlers measuring 50-inches (127-centimeters) wide to be harvested. None of the three moose had the required spread, said Aaron Peterson, an assistant attorney general who prosecuted the case. ""The working theory is that he realized they were sublegal and decided not to stick around to salvage the meat,"" Peterson said Monday. He called the case one of the most egregious poaching events ever seen by Alaska state wildlife troopers. Alaska officials take seriously the harvesting of moose and salvaging of meat, Alaska Department of Fish and Game spokesman Ken Marsh said. A bull moose can weigh up to 1,600 pounds (725 kilograms) and feed a family for months with meat free of chemicals and hormones. A successful hunt is also a source of pride, Marsh said. ""It's a really important part of our culture and tradition, and people take that seriously,"" he said. The case began Sept. 2 with a tip to wildlife troopers that a sublegal moose with antlers of about 45 inches (114 centimeters) was shot and abandoned. Counts was the suspected shooter, witnesses said. A second tip came in Sept. 14. A teacher reported a second dead moose shot the day before. The moose had an antler spread of just 25 inches, (63.5 centimeters), half the legal requirement. The teacher recognized one of the hunters, a former student, with an adult. Troopers interviewed the boy, who is Counts' nephew. He confirmed that his uncle had shot the two moose plus a third with a 26-inch (66-centimeter) antler spread on Sept. 7 when he was not with his uncle. Both hunters left their rifles in the woods Sept. 13 to avoid being caught, the boy said. Troopers interviewed Counts, and he admitted shooting the three moose. Jeff Selinger, a department of Fish and Game wildlife biologist in Soldotna, said the 50-inch antler requirement extends the hunting season and protects younger mature moose, ensuring that they will be around for future breeding. Hunters can educate themselves on determining a legal moose by reading regulations and watching department videos. If there's doubt, Sellinger recommends passing up the shot. ""You're going to pass up some legal moose doing that, but you're not going to shoot a sublegal moose,"" he said. Peterson backed the hefty penalties for Counts as a deterrent to others. If Counts had salvaged meat from the first moose, he likely would have been penalized for a single hunting violation. ""That meat goes to shelters, food banks. It goes to people who need it,"" Peterson said. ""Instead, we have three bull moose that fully go to waste."" Counts was fined $97,650 and ordered to pay $3,000 in restitution. He forfeited his rifle and an all-terrain vehicle and was sentenced to 270 days in jail. ""If you do the right thing in the field, this kind of thing doesn't happen. But if you poach and leave moose, these are the appropriate sanctions, in the state's view,"" Peterson said."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Florida man accused of double murder wheeled into court screaming 'God,' shouts at judge before bond denied"	"The first appearance in court of a man accused of fatally shooting two people at an apartment complex in Florida on Sunday swiftly went off the rails as the defendant began screaming for a higher power as he was wheeled in and then began shouting at the judge. Damon Kemp, 19, was brought into court screaming while screaming ""God!"" for his appearance in Daytona Beach -- even as staff warned him to be quiet. “I've reviewed your arrest and determined there's probable cause for your arrest,” the judge said over Kemp’s shouting. “I've appointed the public defender to represent you so you have a lawyer, this morning.” During the hearing, Kemp's eyes could be seen darting around as he made odd facial expressions before ultimately being denied bond, FOX35 reported. Kemp was charged with two counts of second-degree murder for the shooting deaths of Treay Ingraham and Jordan Paden, who were both his roommates. Police said that Ingraham and Paden let Kemp stay with them at their Daytona Beach apartment, and were trying to help him. As bailiffs wheeled Kemp out, Ingraham's relatives couldn't hold back their anger and began shouting, FOX35 reported. “Day-Day, why would you do that to Treay?” one of them pleaded, “Day-Day, I fed you, Treay fed you! He let you live in his house rent-free, why would you do that to Treay, Day-Day?! Day-Day's wrong for that! He's wrong for that!” Ingraham's distraught mother, Nerissa Carter Young, told FOX35 she was desperate to know why her son is dead. “Even the young man who committed this crime, or they say committed this crime -- all of them only 19. All of them just babies,” Young said."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Man charged in North Carolina girl's murder linked to 2016 rape case	"A man charged in the kidnapping and murder of a 13-year-old North Carolina girl helped authorities solve a 2016 rape case after DNA evidence linked him to both of the heinous crimes. Michael Ray McLellan, 34, appeared in court Monday after he was arrested Saturday on charges including first-degree murder and rape. McLellan is accused of murdering Hania Aguilar, who was kidnapped in front of her home in Lumberton, North Carolina on Nov. 5. Robeson County District Attorney Johnson Britt said during a news conference that while investigating Aguilar’s murder, authorities connected McLellan to the 2016 rape case through DNA evidence. Britt added investigators “got the results that [they] were looking for on Friday.” McLellan faces first-degree rape and first-degree burglary charges in the 2016 incident. Aguilar was heading to school when McLellan allegedly forced her into her relative’s idling SUV parked in the driveway and sped off. The abduction sparked a nationwide manhunt for weeks until her body was located in the water in Robeson County. Investigators identified McLellan as a suspect after extracting DNA evidence found in the SUV that was abandoned and located days after Aguilar’s kidnapping. McLellan’s DNA was already in the system due to prior convictions. “When the car was found and the car was processed, Mr. McLellan became a suspect,” Britt said. McLellan will be kept in custody in Raleigh between court appearances in Robeson County, Britt said. The 34-year-old alleged murderer was previously convicted in 2007 of assault with a deadly weapon and was released on parole in 2016, News & Observer of Raleigh reported. He'd been released from prison in June and was still on parole from a 2017 felony breaking and entering conviction. The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Kentucky girl, 3, killed by uncle in knife attack heard over baby monitor"	"A 3-year-old girl died in Kentucky after her uncle slit her throat in an attack her father heard over the baby monitor, authorities said. Josephine Mia Bulubenchi died Sunday at the University of Kentucky Children’s Hospital, where she was taken after being allegedly attacked early Saturday by Emanuel Fluter, her 33-year-old uncle who was living with his sister, Simona Bulubenchi, in Clinton County, the Lexington Herald-Leader reports. Sheriff Jim Guffey said the killing was the “most horrendous crime” he had seen in more than 15 years on the job. The girl’s father, Benjamin Bulubenchi, heard his daughter screaming on a baby monitor during the attack. He rushed into the girl’s room and found her throat slit. Fluter then turned the knife on the father, cutting him as well, Guffey told the newspaper. Four other children were also in the room during the attack, WKYT reports. It’s unclear what provoked the attack, but Guffey said investigators do not believe Fluter was under the influence of drugs. Click for more from the New York Post."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Indiana teen denied bail as funeral arranged for pregnant cheerleader he is accused of brutally killing	"The Indiana high school football player accused of plunging a knife through the heart of a 17-year-old pregnant cheerleader – killing her and the unborn baby he'd reportedly fathered – was denied bail Tuesday in his first court appearance. Aaron Trejo, 16, appeared at the St. Joseph County Superior Court after being charged with murder and feticide in the death of Breana Rouhselang, whose body was found stuffed in a restaurant dumpster this past weekend in Mishawaka, a city about 80 miles east of Chicago. Trejo was denied bail because of the murder charge and he is considered a ""high risk"", a judge said at the hearing, according to WSBT. Her funeral, meanwhile, will be held next Monday at the New Life Baptist Church in nearby Osceola. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help cover costs. ""This loving young lady was so full of life and didn't deserve this,"" the page says. In charging documents obtained by Fox News on Monday, Trejo -- in an interview with South Bend Detective Gery Mullins – revealed he was “aware of Breana’s pregnancy and that he was supposed to be the father of the baby.” Mullins said Trejo ""explained that Breana waited too long to tell Aaron about the pregnancy to get an abortion. I asked Aaron what he did about that, and he replied, 'I took action...I took her life.'"" Rouhselang was last seen alive at her home late Saturday night and her body was found the next morning. Rouhselang’s mother told police her daughter was six months pregnant and had “gone behind the house to talk to the juvenile male who is the father of the baby.” Investigators, while searching for her, found blood, glasses and a hat that apparently belonged to Rouhselang in that area. The restaurant that owns the dumpster her body was found in said it was “upset that this took place in our neighborhood and are saddened for our Mishawaka city.” Trejo told police that he stabbed Rouhselang in her heart with a knife because he thought it would kill her quickly, then stuffed her into a black plastic bag, tossed it in a trash bin behind a restaurant and threw her phone and the weapon into the river as far as he could, according to Mullins. “Aaron Trejo said that he had been planning and thinking about killing Breana and the baby for about a week and had not told anybody,” the document added. Police say an autopsy on Rouhselang -- a Mishawaka High School student, softball coach, cheerleader and football team manager -- showed she died from multiple stab wounds. A scarf also “had been tied so tightly” around her neck that “strangulation was occurring” before she died, Mullins said."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"2 Mississippi children shot near hospital, suspect taken into custody"	"A Mississippi man has confessed to shooting two young children near a hospital late last month, Jackson police said on Monday. Alcantera Garner, 20, surrendered Monday evening and confessed to the Nov. 29 drive-by shooting near the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, The Clarion-Ledger reported, citing Jackson Police Chief James Davis. Garner’s mother delivered him to police, Davis said. The two children, ages 1 and 3, were shot in the back seat of their mother's car when a driver pulled up alongside them and opened fire. The 1-year-old was shot in the leg and the 3-year-old was shot in the torso, the report said. The mother pulled them from her car and ran them into the emergency room. The children have since been released from the hospital. Garner did not immediately tell investigators why he shot into the vehicle, Davis said. Police were questioning Garner Monday night to determine a motive, according to The Clarion-Ledger. Police said Garner has been charged with 3 counts of aggravated assault and one count of shooting into an occupied vehicle. The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Feds offer dramatic details on FBI agent’s shooting in Brooklyn	"The feds provided a vivid, blow-by-blow account Monday of the broad-daylight ambush shooting of an FBI agent in Brooklyn. Reputed Crips gang member Ronell Watson drove a BMW M5 the wrong way on Canarsie Road and blocked in the agent’s car, got out, went up to the driver’s-side door and began blasting when the agent tried to get away, court papers say. The unidentified agent was hit “by at least one round and suffered a gunshot wound to his torso,” but got out of the car and returned fire, hitting Watson at least once before Watson hopped back in the BMW and drove off. Law enforcement sources have said the agent and two other feds in his car were conducting a gang-related stakeout at the time of the shooting Saturday afternoon. Watson dumped the car at a nearby auto-body shop and later showed up for treatment at Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center, where he claimed to have been an innocent bystander shot during a gunfight, according to the feds. But law enforcement officers overheard him call his live-in girlfriend, Molissa Gangapersad, and tell her to go to their house and “get the jewelry and get rid of it,” court papers allege. When FBI agents went to interview Gangapersad, she allegedly claimed not to have seen the shooting — but the feds say she changed her tune when she was confronted with surveillance video that shows her on the front porch of their house, with a clear view of the incident at the time it occurred. A search of their home allegedly turned up 1 and a half pounds of pot, $15,000 in cash and “large amounts of jewelry” stashed in their bedroom. Brooklyn US Attorney Richard Donoghue personally appeared in court Monday to successfully argue that Watson should be held without bail, calling him “a gun-wielding, drug-dealing gang member who shot an FBI agent in broad daylight.” Donoghue said the evidence against Watson includes multiple videos of the shooting. Law enforcement sources have said that Watson was driven to the hospital by Hector Amissah, 31, who wasn’t charged on Monday. The Brooklyn US Attorney’s Office wouldn’t say why or whether Amissah was cooperating with authorities. Gangapersad was released on $500,000 bond, but neither she nor any of the defense lawyers in the case would comment. Click here for more from The New York Post."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Indiana teen charged with killing pregnant schoolmate	"An Indiana high school football player told investigators that he killed a 17-year-old schoolmate because he was angry that she waited so long to tell him she was pregnant with his child that it was too late to get an abortion, authorities said Monday. Aaron Trejo, 16, was charged as an adult with murder in the Sunday killing of Breana Rouhselang and the fetus. He was arrested Sunday, scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday and had no attorney on record. In a court filing supporting the charges, prosecutors say Trejo told police that he stabbed Rouhselang during a fight over her pregnancy and that he put her body in a restaurant dumpster in their hometown of Mishawaka, which is next to South Bend and about 80 miles (130 kilometers) east of Chicago. After disposing of her body, Trejo recounted walking to a river and throwing her phone and the knife he brought from home as far as he could into it, police said. Trejo told investigators he had been planning the killing for about a week and hadn't told anyone. Rouhselang, who was a manager of the Mishawaka High School football team, was last seen at her home at around 11 p.m. Saturday. Her family called police about 4:30 a.m. Sunday after they ""got the feeling that something wasn't right,"" said Lt. Alex Arendt of the St. Joseph County Metro Homicide Unit. An autopsy determined that Rouhselang died from multiple stab wounds and that a scarf had been tied tightly enough around her neck that strangulation was occurring before she died. Her stepmother, Nicole Rouhselang, told reporters Sunday that Rouhselang had been a softball coach, cheerleader and football team manager at the school. She also said her stepdaughter was about six months pregnant when she died. Indiana generally doesn't allow abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy. ""I've known her since she was 6,"" she said. ""I just don't understand it."" Mishawaka schools Superintendent Dean Speicher said some of the high school's 1,500 students took part in a silent vigil Monday morning to honor Rouhselang. Speicher said Rouhselang and Trejo had attended schools together since elementary grades, but he didn't know any details about any relationship between them. ""They've known each other long before they came together — she as a manager and he as a football player — at Mishawaka High School,"" he said. Speicher said he didn't know of any previous violence between the students. ""To our knowledge there were no signs, everything appeared to be very normal,"" he said."	nonTerrorism	Crime

The commissioner of the city's Department of Social Services says he's ""deeply troubled"" by the situation and a ""thorough"" review is underway. A witness says security guards confronted Jazmine Headley, who was sitting on the floor because of a lack of chairs. They called police when she refused to leave.

"Police, FBI probe suspected white supremacist attack on DJ"	"The FBI is helping investigate an attack by several suspected white supremacists on a black disc jockey at a tavern in Washington state over the weekend, authorities said Monday. Seven men and one woman were arrested for investigation of assault, hate crimes and other allegations early Saturday in Lynnwood, according to the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office. Investigators said the group entered the Rec Room Bar and Grill, tried to take over the DJ's equipment, then beat him and stomped him while shouting racial slurs. They also injured an Asian man who came to the DJ's defense, the sheriff's office said. The DJ was treated at a hospital for a swollen eye and other non-life-threatening injuries. ""The violent behavior directed at members of our community over the weekend simply because of their race is disgusting,"" Snohomish County Sheriff Ty Trenary said in a news release. ""The Sheriff's Office is partnering with the FBI in hopes of getting the strongest sentencing possible for these hate crimes."" Court papers identified the suspects as being affiliated with the Aryan Brotherhood. They were due to appear in court by video from the Snohomish County Jail in Everett on Monday afternoon. It was not immediately clear if they had obtained lawyers. Prosecutors have until Wednesday afternoon to file charges. Authorities say they believe the group, which included people from Washington, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Illinois and Oregon, was in Washington state to mark the anniversary of the death of white supremacist leader Robert Jay Mathews. Mathews led The Order, a white separatist group, until he was killed in a shootout with the FBI on Whidbey Island, north of Seattle, in 1984. His followers refer to the anniversary as ""Martyr's Day."" Among those arrested was Travis David Condor, a former soldier from Pittsburgh who was previously sentenced to 90 days in jail for beating a homeless man with a baseball bat in Cincinnati. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, Condor runs the hate music record label American Defense Records, and he was photographed attending the ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year, which turned deadly when James Alex Fields Jr. rammed his car into a crowd of counter-protesters. The attack on the DJ came just hours after a jury on Friday convicted Fields of first-degree murder and other charges. A message left by The Associated Press on Condor's phone Monday was not immediately returned. Deputies responding to a 911 call at the tavern said they saw several people trying to flee in a white pickup; the driver refused orders to stop. They later pulled over the vehicle and arrested the six people inside, including Condor and Randy A. Smith, 38, of Eugene, Oregon. Smith's hands were bloody, a deputy wrote in a probable-cause statement. Two other suspects were arrested after being found in another car that had left the bar, authorities said. The driver of that vehicle, identified as Vincent B. Nutter, 28, of Bothell, was arrested for investigation of driving under the influence in addition to allegations related to the assault. He refused to submit to breath or other tests, court documents said. Nutter has a lengthy criminal history in Washington which includes drug and gun offenses. In 2013, he was arrested following a manhunt that involved helicopters and police dogs; he eventually climbed 40 feet into a Douglas fir tree and surrendered only after firefighters blasted him a few times with a fire hose, according to an account in The Daily Herald newspaper of Everett. He was sentenced to six years in prison. The other suspects arrested were: Northcraft did not participate in the assault but did yell slurs and threats and thus was arrested for investigation of malicious harassment, the state's hate crime law, deputies said. A message to a phone number listed for her was not immediately returned. The suspects were being held on $15,000 bail, except for Colwell, who was released on his own recognizance, according to the Snohomish County Prosecutor's Office."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Neighbor: Mom screamed for help amid fire that killed 5 kids	"An anguished mother, naked and bleeding, banged on the door of the house across the street and screamed for help in a fruitless plea to save her five children as a late-night fire swallowed their Ohio home, a neighbor said Monday. Fire officials in Youngstown said the woman jumped from a second-story window and was the only survivor of the Sunday blaze that killed the children. They ranged in age from 1 to 9, the youngest being twins. Neighbor Aaron Baldwin said by the time he awoke from the woman banging on his door, her house was engulfed in flames and there was no way for neighbors to rush inside. ""It was horrible. It was the worst thing you have to see,"" said Baldwin, 28, who also has five young children. ""I'm seeing myself in her predicament."" The Mahoning County Coroner's Office identified the children as 9-year-old Aleysha Rosario, 3-year-old Charles Gunn, 2-year-old Ly'Asia Gunn, and 1-year-old twins Brianna and Arianna Negron. District spokeswoman Denise Dick said Aleysha was a fourth-grader at a Youngstown elementary school, where counselors were being made available as news spread about the children's deaths. Their mother, whom fire investigators didn't publicly identify, was taken to MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland. The hospital said she was in critical condition Monday evening. Seventeen-year-old Edgar Daniel Negron said it was his aunt who was hospitalized and his cousins who died. He said the fire occurred while his aunt was spending rare time with all of her children under one roof. She has been studying nursing, and her children sometimes stayed with relatives or their godparents, but they were all together Sunday night, Negron said. State and local investigators are trying to determine what caused the blaze. They said nothing so far indicates the fire was suspicious. It swept through the old, two-story wood home after neighbors were awakened by a loud boom. Most of the damage was on the first floor, leading investigators to believe the fire started there, said Capt. Kurt Wright of the Youngstown Fire Department. Firefighters found flames throughout the first floor when they arrived and were able to pull out three of the children, but they died at a hospital, Wright said. One firefighter was treated at a hospital and released, and another was treated at the scene. The family had moved into the house earlier this year, according to neighbors and friends. Virgen Bonilla said she was the children's babysitter. She visited the charred and boarded-up home Monday with her sister and a family friend to leave flowers at a makeshift memorial where stuffed animals were piled beneath balloons. ""These kids were always with me. They were my babies,"" Bonilla said, wiping away tears with her scarf as she shared memories of them — how Aleysha loved to dance, and Charles sang in Spanish, and Ly'Asia was quieter and liked to be off by herself. Neighbor Jerry Fields also stopped outside the home to drop off stuffed animals. ""I needed to do something,"" said Fields, 68. ""I didn't know what else to do."" Negron said he has organized a GoFundMe campaign to help with the funeral costs. City Councilwoman Anita Davis said the community plans to hold a dinner next week to raise funds for the family.

The cheerleader's body turned up in a trash bin behind a restaurant in Mishawaka, near South Bend and about 80 miles east of Chicago, over the weekend.

"Nebraska man who killed wife decades ago admits killing parents, niece"	"A Nebraska man who pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the death of his wife two decades ago admitted Monday to fatally shooting his parents and an 18-year-old niece last year. John Dalton Jr., 46, pleaded guilty to three counts of first-degree murder and four weapons counts in Douglas County District Court. He was sentenced to three life terms plus up to 230 years in prison. ""They're looking for answers — and they're asking lots of questions — but sometimes there are none. It's just pure evil,"" chief deputy Douglas County attorney Brenda Beadle said. ""If ever there was a case that warranted the maximum sentence, this is it."" Dalton was arrested in Tennessee on Dec. 27, 2017, and accused of shooting 70-year-old John Dalton Sr., 65-year-old Jean Dalton and Leonna Dalton-Phillip in his parents' Omaha home. Investigators said another niece, age 6, was also present but hid under a couch and was able to identify the younger Dalton as the shooter. Dalton was paroled in 2010 after spending 11 years in jail for the September 1998 death of his wife Shannon. After that shooting, Dalton fled to Tennessee, where he was captured a few days later The couple had three daughters, all of whom were at home when the shooting took place. Dalton's youngest daughter, Alicia, said Monday that the deaths of her grandparents and cousin were devastating. ""In a matter of seconds,"" she said, ""everything I had was lost."" In addition to the manslaughter conviction, Dalton's criminal record included convictions for delivery of cocaine, and leaving the scene of an accident and fleeing to avoid arrest in the early 1990s.

Alabama prison homicide rate highest in nation	"n the span of three hours at a southwest Alabama prison, one inmate was fatally stabbed and another was seriously wounded after being stabbed in a separate fight. Eighteen inmates have been killed by other inmates since October of 2016, according to statistics and news releases from the Department of Corrections. The Montgomery-based nonprofit organization Equal Justice Initiative released a report last week finding that Alabama's prisons are the most lethal in the nation. The report found that Alabama's rate of over 34 homicides per 100,000 people incarcerated is more than 600 percent greater than the national average from 2001 to 2014. Equal Justice Initiative attorney Charlotte Morrison said prison staff and inmates live ""under constant threat of violence."" ""The violence is epidemic,"" Morrison said. ""We have a crisis that is not going to get better until we see a more effective and committed response from state leadership to addressing the issue Bob Horton, a spokesman for the Department of Corrections, said the prison homicide rate is a ""priority concern."" He said he could not comment on the nonprofit's findings because he did not know how they did their comparison. ""There is a direct correlation between the level of prison violence and the shortage of correctional staff in an overpopulated prison system with limited resources for rehabilitating offenders. The proliferation of drugs and criminal activity inside prisons also contribute to an increase in violent incidents,"" Horton wrote in an email. ""The Alabama Department of Corrections recognizes the seriousness of the problem and is taking steps to reverse this trend,"" Horton wrote. The prison system's monthly reports list that 16 inmates died in homicides in fiscal years 2017 and 2018. So far this fiscal year, the department has reported two fatal stabbings. Twenty-nine-year-old Vaquerro Kinjuan Armstrong was fatally stabbed Dec. 2 at William C. Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore. Armstrong was serving a 22-year sentence on a 2009 first-degree robbery conviction in Talladega County. About three hours later, another inmate was critically wounded when another fight broke out in the same prison. Staffing levels have been raised as an issue in an ongoing lawsuit over prison mental health care. Alabama Corrections Commissioner Jeff Dunn told The Associated Press earlier this year that estimates filed with the court show the state needs to add about 1,800 officers — nearly doubling current staffing levels. The department has begun an effort to recruit and retain additional staff. As an initial effort to increase officer ranks, the department authorized a five and 10 percent pay increase for officers at minimum and maximum security prisons. State Sen. Cam Ward, co-chair of the legislative prison oversight committee, said EJI's finding sounded accurate. Ward said a side effect of sentencing reform efforts, which sought to relieve prison overcrowding by keeping nonviolent offenders out of prison, is that prison populations are made up mostly of violent offenders. The Equal Justice Initiative filed a class-action lawsuit in 2014 against the state Department of Corrections in connection with previous homicides and assaults at St. Clair correctional facility.

The Kansas Attorney General said 52-year-old Kimberly Younger, of McIntosh, Florida; 54-year-old Michael Fowler Jr., of Sarasota, Florida; and 35-year-old Rusty Frasier, of Aransas Pass, Texas, are jailed on $1 million bond in Arkansas, where they also face charges. Alfred ""Sonny"" Carpenter and Pauline Carpenter of Wichita had been selling crafts, jewelry, purses and other handmade items at the fair in Barton County, Kansas, in July when they were killed. Investigators believe the carnival workers used the couple's recreational vehicle to drive the bodies 320 miles (515 kilometers) to Van Buren, Arkansas. Their bodies were found buried in shallow graves next to a creek outside the small community of Natural Dam in the Ozark National Forest. Police in Arkansas have said Younger texted the other suspects posing as a carnival mafia boss named Frank Zaitchik and ordered them to kill the Carpenters and dispose of the bodies. Fowler told investigators that he believed this was an initiation into the carnival mafia, so he shot the couple and Frasier stabbed Alfred Carpenter. Asked whether a carnival mafia even exists, Van Buren police spokesman Jonathan Wear said in an email that this was something Younger ""definitely made up."" When told that the order to kill had come from Younger, not Zaitchik, Fowler said she had ""suckered"" him in and that he had thrown his life away, according to police reports. Fowler is also charged in Kansas with theft, while Younger faces charges in that state of conspiracy to commit murder, solicitation and theft. A spokeswoman in the Kansas Attorney General's office didn't immediately respond to questions about whether the suspects have attorneys who can speak on their behalf. Two others — 38-year-old Christine Tenney, of Santa Fe, Texas, and 31-year-old Thomas Drake, of Van Buren, Arkansas — are charged with obstructing apprehension. All five are awaiting extradition to Kansas. Younger, Fowler, Frasier and Tenney have pleaded not guilty in Arkansas to charges that include abuse of a corpse."	nonTerrorism	Crime
5 white Georgia police officers could face trial in deaths of unarmed black men next year	"As many as five police officers in Georgia – all of whom are white – are likely to stand trial in the deaths of unarmed black men next year, a noteworthy number of prosecutions in a state which has historically had a high bar for trying cops. All five officers – including DeKalb County Police Officer Robert Olsen who killed Afghanistan war veteran Anthony Hill in 2015 – were indicted under new state grand jury rules that went into effect in 2015, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. The new rules no longer allow officers to look at the prosecution’s case and then testify -- without being cross-examined -- privileges historically available only to cops in Georgia. “There was a long period where there weren’t any [prosecutions of police officers], so five is worth noting,” former DeKalb District Attorney Robert James told the newspaper. The new rules, he said, “somewhere leveled the playing field,” in getting a murder charge against Olsen and the other police officers. “There were some incidents that I thought were wrong, that I was very upset about, but under the laws at the time, the officers were protected and there was no way we were going to win those cases,” James added. Olsen’s trial is expected first. He is accused of shooting Hall on March 9, 2015, while responding to a call about a naked man behaving erratically outside a suburban Atlanta apartment complex. Earlier this year, during an immunity hearing, Olsen claimed self-defense and that he believed he was going to get “pummeled and pounded” by the unarmed U.S. Air Force veteran’ Three police officers – Washington County deputies Michael Howell, Henry L. Copeland, and Rhett Scott – were indicted for allegedly Tasing victim Eurie Lee Martin, 59, to death in July 2017. According to the newspaper, the fatal incident began with a request for water on a hot July afternoon. The Georgia Bureau of Investigations concluded that Martin, who suffered from schizophrenia and was walking some 20 miles to see relatives in Sandersville, broke no laws when he was questioned by Howell. Cellphone video shot by a passing motorist showed Martin face down, handcuffed and drying of respiratory distress, according to the Journal-Constitution. Meanwhile, former Atlanta Police Officer James Burns was re-indicted in September for the death of Deravis Rogers. Prosecutors say Burns was responding to a suspicious person call in June 2016 when he fired shots into a car driven by the 22-year-old Rogers, killing him. Investigators said they concluded the officer wasn't in danger when he opened fire, and that he had no way to identify Rogers as the reported suspicious person. Trial dates have not been set for the officers, but prosecutors expect them to happen sometime in 2019. The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Crime

A group of donors raised funds to provide a burial service for the girl, who's known as ""Baby Jane Doe."" She was discovered July 27, wrapped in a t-shirt with stripes and a floral pattern near Interstate 15 in Corona, located east of Los Angeles. Jon Castillo, a Corona police chaplain, led about 70 people in prayer near the tiny, flower-draped casket Thursday, the Press-Enterprise reported. ""Every person who walks the planet is born in God's image, and she had inherent value and worth,"" he told those gathered at the service.

3 arrested in protests over Alabama police shooting	"Three people have been arrested in the continuing protests over the fatal police shooting of a black man inside Alabama's largest shopping mall on Thanksgiving night, authorities said Monday. Two men were arrested Sunday on disorderly conduct charges after a protest that briefly shut down an interstate highway. A woman was arrested Thursday after someone was seen throwing Christmas ornaments into traffic in Hoover, where the shooting occurred. News outlets reported the woman allegedly told authorities she was doing it as part of the protests seeking justice for Emantic ""EJ"" Bradford Jr., who was killed by a police officer who mistook him for the gunman in a shooting that wounded two people in the Riverchase Galleria. It was unclear whether any of the three who were arrested have attorneys to speak on their behalf. In a statement, the city said it supported the right to protest peacefully but that blocking Interstate 459 presents ""a serious public safety concern for everyone."" ""We have consistently stated that we will not allow roads and highways to be blocked by protesters because it is hazardous and jeopardizes the safety of all citizens and visitors to Hoover,"" said the statement. No one was hurt in the interstate protest, but authorities said two security guards suffered minor injuries during a demonstration at an upscale resort in Hoover, a city of about 85,000 people in suburban Birmingham. The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund last week asked federal authorities to investigate Bradford's death, citing questions including differing police accounts of what occurred. The chief federal prosecutor in north Alabama, Jay Town, said officials are monitoring the situation."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Jehovah's Witness halls in Washington state targeted by arson attacks, at least 5 since March"	"A fire that ripped through a Jehovah’s Witness Kingdom Hall in Washington state Friday is now the fifth blaze in an apparent series of attacks targeting houses of worship in the area during the past nine months. The Seattle Division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Saturday the agency determined the fire at the Jehovah's Witness Kingdom Hall in Lacey was an arson. The Thurston County Sheriff's Office said the blaze was reported around 3:42 a.m. and prompted a response by the ATF and a local task force that's been looking into attacks targeting other Kingdom Halls in the county, located about 70 miles southwest of Seattle. “Makes you feel really ill about somebody who has some sort of animosity towards any religion,” Thurston County Sheriff John Snaza told Q13 News. Since March there have been five attacks at Jehovah’s Witness Kingdom Halls in Thurston County. Two arsons took place on March 19 at Kingdom Halls in Tumwater and Olympia with minor damage reported, according to the ATF. The third incident was reported May 15, when someone fired 35 rifle rounds at a Kingdom Hall in Yelm and caused more than $10,000 in damage. Someone then returned back to the building in Olympia on July 3 and set a fire that destroyed the building. In August, someone tried to set fire to the Kingdom Hall in Yelm. Church elders at the time had arrived to find fire logs stacked up against an outside wall that was smoldering, Q13 News reported at the time. They were able to douse the logs with water and prevented any further damage to the building. “More or less they’re terrified,” Snaza told Q13 News. “Why are they being targeted? Why is this specific religion being targeted?” SEARCH EXPANDS FOR COLORADO MOM, 29, LAST SEEN ON THANKSGIVING Dan Woollett, a minister at Lacey Kingdom Hall, called the blaze on Friday ""devastating"" for the whole congregation. “It’s devastating for sure but you know it’s just a building,"" he said. ""Everybody’s safe and that’s the important thing."" The ATF said authorities are offering up to a $36,000 reward for information in the case. No injuries have been reported in any of the incidents, but Seattle ATF agent Derek Pleasant told Q13 News that ""it is inevitable that innocent people will be injured or killed if these incidents go unchecked."" ""We take events at houses of worship very seriously and are appealing to those who live in and around Thurston and the surrounding counties to partner with us in protecting their communities in this investigation,"" Pleasant said. A spokesperson for Jehovah's Witnesses told Fox News there are over 33,000 worshippers in Washington state who meet in 163 Kingdom Halls. ""Jehovah’s Witnesses work hard to be a force for good in their community, so violent acts like this are difficult to comprehend,"" David A. Semonian told Fox News. ""We are grateful for the efforts of the authorities to apprehend those responsible and restore safety and security for both our fellow worshippers and their neighbors."" Anyone with information on the fires or the shooting at the religious facilities is asked to call ATF's toll-free hotline at 888-ATF-TIPS, Crime Stoppers of South Sound at 1-800-222-TIPS, or the Arson Alarm Foundation at 1-800-55-ARSON."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Chicago campaign volunteer shot on Facebook Live while handing out pamphlets	"Maxwell Little was canvassing a Chicago neighborhood in support of an alderman candidate who's spoken out about the city's gun violence epidemic -- when suddenly Little found himself a victim of that violence. Little was streaming on Facebook Live on Sunday telling his viewers about Joseph Williams, a candidate in the 15th Ward, when multiple gunshots suddenly rang out. The 32-year-old campaign volunteer looked over his shoulder and fled, stopping the camera. Little was shot once in the leg by a masked man, he said in a Facebook post later. The shooting occurred just before 2 p.m. Sunday in the West Englewood neighborhood and an arrest has not yet been made, the Chicago Tribune reported.

California mother drowns twin sons at motel where she was staying for free	"A California mother was arrested Thursday for allegedly drowning her twin 10-month-old sons at a motel where police had arranged for her to stay after she was removed from a shelter for causing a disturbance, authorities said. Heather Langdon, 37, was facing murder charges for the deaths of her sons, Mason and Maddox Murguia, according to People. Langdon was taken to the Tulare motel after she was told she couldn’t stay at the women’s shelter, police said. Officers had no previous contact with Langdon and would have called for mental health assistance if they believed she posed a danger to herself or her children, Tulare police Sgt. Jon Hamlin said. Hamlin said officers found a nonprofit agency willing to pay for the motel room Langdon was staying at. He added officers didn’t want to leave without finding a shelter for Langdon and her children because it was a cold night. Maria Marez, who lives near the motel, told YourCentralValley.com she saw Langdon the morning the boys were killed. “She was like, ‘I almost drowned them. I almost drowned them’ and then I flagged down the police,” Marez said. “She kept saying that: ‘I almost drowned them. I almost drowned my babies,’ and she was trying to help the babies but I didn’t know that they were already deceased. She was just standing there looking around. She looked kind of worried, like something was wrong.” The twins weren’t breathing when officers arrived on the scene and they were later pronounced dead at a hospital.

"‘Whitey’ Bulger thought he was headed to hospital before prison murder, family to file lawsuit"	"The family of notorious Boston mobster James “Whitey” Bulger plans to file a lawsuit against the government claiming wrongful death and negligence more than a month after his mysterious murder inside a West Virginia prison. Hank Brennan, Bulger’s longtime attorney, told the Wall Street Journal on Sunday, the gangster’s estate wants to find out why authorities sent the infamous mob boss to U.S. Penitentiary Hazelton in October, where he was beaten to death inside his unlocked cell fewer than 24 hours after his transfer. “It’s important for the family and the public to know why the prisons decided to wheel an 89-year-old man with a history of heart attacks into one of the most dangerous prisons in the country,” Brennan told the Journal. Brennan, who became Bulger’s attorney after the gangster’s arrest in 2011, said Bulger told him in September during one of their last conversations that he was getting out of solitary confinement at a federal prison in Florida and being transferred to a prison medical facility. Instead, a month later, on Oct. 30, the 89-year-old mob boss was killed the day he arrived at the West Virginia prison. He was found bloodied and wrapped in a blanket after apparently being beaten with a lock stuffed in a sock. No one has been charged yet in the killing, but two Massachusetts mobsters are among the suspects, officials have said. A Bureau of Prisons spokesperson told the WSJ that Bulger was transferred from the Florida prison because of a threat he made against a staff member and the transfer was made in accordance with the bureau’s policy. Bulger, the model for Jack Nicholson’s ruthless crime boss in the 2006 Martin Scorsese movie “The Departed,” led a largely Irish mob that ran loan-sharking, gambling and drug rackets. He was also an FBI informant who ratted on the New England mob, his gang’s main rival, in an era when bringing down the Mafia was a top national priority for the FBI. He spent 16 years as one of America's most wanted fugitives until he was found in 2011, living with his girlfriend in a rent-controlled apartment in Santa Monica, California. Bulger was sentenced to life in prison in 2013 for 11 murders and numerous other crimes. He'd been assigned to prisons in Arizona and Florida specializing in sick inmates before he arrived at Hazelton prison in Bruceton Mills last month.

New Jersey mansion murders spur calls for state to reinstate death penalty	"The brutal killings of a New Jersey family at their burning mansion last month has spurred a group of lawmakers to call for the death penalty to be restored in the state. Paul Caneiro, 51, was charged on Nov. 30 with killing his brother Keith Caneiro, 50; Keith's wife, Jennifer; and their two young children two days before they were to host Thanksgiving at their sleek $1.5 million mansion. Monmouth County Prosecutor Christopher Gramiccioni has said the murder motives were “financial in nature,"" related to businesses the brothers were involved in, adding that the killings were one of the ""most brutal"" crimes he has seen. The slayings of the Colts Neck family now have some lawmakers calling for action on legislation to reinstate the death penalty for certain crimes. New Jersey banned capital punishment in 2007 after a one-year moratorium, becoming the first state to legislatively abolish the death penalty since 1965.  New Jersey's current governor, Democrat Phil Murphy, is opposed to the death penalty, representatives told the New Jersey Globe. NEW JERSEY MAN KILLED BROTHER AND HIS FAMILY OVER FINANCIAL ISSUE INVOLVING JOINT BUSINESS, PROSECUTOR SAYS But Republican State Sen. Steven Oroho said Wednesday the killings showed the need for New Jersey to reinstate the death penalty. ""The horrible truth is that unless killers know the death penalty is on the table, there are monsters out there that will kill,"" he said in a statement. ""In order to keep the public safe, we must reinstate the death penalty."" Oroho co-sponsored a bill with fellow GOP Assemblymen Parker Space and Harold Wirths before the murders, but was unsuccessful with moving it forward. Wirths told the Asbury Park Press that while the bill may face trouble with lawmakers in Trenton, it may have support from voters if it were to ever go on a statewide ballot. “I’d love for this to be a ballot or referendum question,” he told the paper. “I just can’t imagine the argument on the other end."" NEW JERSEY MANSION FIRE: BROTHER WAS SPOTTED BY NEIGHBOR HALF HOUR BEFORE BLAZE; COMMUNITY MOURNS SLAIN FAMILY The lawmaker, who was acting governor in 2006 and signed the original moratorium on capital punishment, told News 12 New Jersey that even when the state had the death penalty, it had not executed an inmate since 1963. ""When we had it, it was never utilized. Appeals went on forever and they (death row inmates) were in a nursing home or on a ventilator,” said State Sen. Dick Codey. Prosecutors have said that Caneiro is accused of setting fire to that residence as his wife and two adult daughters slept upstairs. All three safely escaped from the home.

He began fondling himself to “draw the spirits in.” Prior to being punched, Sutherland thought he was “having a telepathic conversation” with the teen, according to police. Sutherland was arrested on charges of burglary, public sexual indecency and aggravated assault. ""I don't think anybody could have done any better than what he's done,"" the boy's father said.

Cleburne police officers who arrived to the church where the holiday event was occurring found three people – including the suspect, Aaron Urbanski, 31 – demonstrating, the department said in a news release. ‘GRINCH’ PRINCIPAL ON LEAVE AFTER ATTEMPT TO BAN CHRISTMAS ITEMS FROM SCHOOL The people staged the protest because they “were upset that the folks there were lying to the children about Santa,"" Officer Brian McQueen told The Dallas Morning News. A church representative requested the individuals to vacate the area numerous times, police said in the news release. However, Urbanski “refused to leave the property and continued causing a disturbance,” police said. The suspect was arrested for criminal trespass and booked into the Johnson County Law Enforcement Center, police said. Fox News’ attempts to reach the Johnson County Law Enforcement Center were unsuccessful. McQueen told Fox News that the department had no further information on Urbanski’s current status SANTA CLAUS TAKE A KNEE TO THANK WORLD WAR II VETERAN IN HEARTWARMING VIRAL VIDEO Cleburn Mayor Scott Cain took to Facebook and offered a word of caution: “Don’t Mess With Santa!” “While I understand folks right to protest, Cleburne loves Santa and those protestors who were naughty and broke the law when they trespassed were arrested promptly,” Cain wrote. “Guess they wanted coal in their stockings to go with a court appearance.” The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"FBI: Man charged in kidnapping, death of North Carolina teen"	"Police have arrested and charged a man with killing a 13-year-old girl who was kidnapped last month from a North Carolina mobile home park. The FBI said early Saturday that Michael Ray McLellan has been charged in connection with the kidnapping and murder of Hania Noelia Aguilar. The announcement comes the same day that a memorial service for Aguilar is set to take place at a local high school. The 34-year-old McLellan faces first-degree murder, rape and eight other felony charges. He'd been released from prison in June and was still on parole from a 2017 felony breaking and entering conviction, according to the News & Observer of Raleigh. He was previously convicted in 2007 of assault with a deadly weapon and was released on parole in 2016, the newspaper reported. He is being held without bond in the Robeson County Detention Center. He will appear in court at the Robeson County Courthouse on Monday. McLellan was in custody at the time of his arrest on charges unrelated to the Aguilar case, police said. On Nov. 5, police said Aguilar went outside to start a relative's SUV to prepare to leave for the bus stop when a man forced her into the vehicle and fled. Her disappearance sparked an intensive search. Drones, dogs, and scores of searchers on foot spent the following weeks combing the area. Police found her body several weeks later in a body of water about 10 miles (16 kilometers) south of the mobile home park where she was kidnapped. ""This is the outcome that we all feared,"" Lumberton Police Chief Michael McNeill told reporters after the body was found. ""We did not want to hear this. We wanted to bring Hania back home and bring her back home alive to our community. It hurts."" Police said they followed more than 850 leads and conducted nearly 500 interviews. The FBI's lab at Quantico, Virginia did a forensic exam on the stolen SUV, which was recovered a few days after Aguilar's initial disappearance. The North Carolina State Crime Lab provided test results on Aguilar's body. Police said the exams helped result in the charges against McLellan. A large turnout is expected at Aguilar's funeral Saturday at Lumberton High School. Her father, who lives in Guatemala, was denied an expedited visa to attend his daughter's funeral. Police said the investigation is ongoing and additional charges could be filed."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Massachusetts man who confessed to murder granted new trial after 33 years	"A man who Massachusetts prosecutors said confessed to killing a young mother 33 years ago has won a new trial under the state’s post-conviction DNA testing law. Arthur Davis, 53, was one of the first inmates in the state to apply for a new trial under the law which was enacted in 2012, his attorney David Siegel told Fox News. “From the beginning, he has maintained his innocence and has wanted to try and prove that ever since,” said Siegel, who teaches at the New England Law School of Law in Boston and worked with the New England Innocence Project on Davis' appeal, along with pro-bono attorney Christopher Schultz. UTAH PROSECUTORS SAY THEY HAVE NAME OF COLD CASE KILLER OF 2 Siegel said he believes that about 12 to 15 inmates have applied for post-conviction DNA testing, including his client. In 1986, Davis was convicted of killing Patricia Richard in Lowell on Feb. 10. 1985. He is currently serving a prison sentence of life without parole. Middlesex County Judge Maynard Kirpalan granted Davis’ request for a new trial in a Nov. 23 ruling. Davis has tried to overturn his conviction four previous times without success. Police found Richard’s nude body in an alcove at the Lowell City Hall. She died after being severely beaten to death. She was attacked apparently as she was walking to an all-night diner after going drinking with friends, the Boston Globe reported. Her violent death came nine days after she gave birth to her first child, a baby girl, according to the Lowell Sun. Richard and Davis were strangers. WOMAN FOUND DEAD IN SLEEPING BAG, WRAPPED IN CARPET ALONG UTAH ROAD IDENTIFIED AFTER 20 YEARS The evidence against Davis included blood found on several items in his home, a cigarette butt, a confession to police and statements to a co-worker and a friend. The cigarette butt was found next to Richard’s body. The friend testified that Davis told him “I killed her for a red and white polka dot dress.” But the DNA testing did not find Richard’s DNA profile on any of the blood samples tested, Kirpalan said. The DNA tests that were conducted weren’t available at the time of the murder. DNA was extracted from the cigarette butt. It belonged to a man, but not Davis, the judge said. “This court concludes that in light of its findings concerning the new DNA evidence, and the likely role the challenged physical evidence played in the jury’s deliberations, there is ‘a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice’ and a new trial is warranted,” Kirpalan said. Siegel said the jury heard Davis testify that his confession to police was coerced. “The statements to the police are inconsistent with each other and were the product of nine or ten hours of interrogation of a 19-year-old,” Siegel said. “They were inconsistent with each other and the physical evidence."" Middlesex County prosecutors are weighing whether to appeal the ruling or retry Davis."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Air Force lieutenant colonel faces child exploitation charge after FBI sex sting	"An FBI sting has snared a high-ranking lieutenant colonel in the Air Force who was accused of trying to meet a girl at a hotel in Georgia after the two spoke online. LT. Col. Willie Newson, 47, was arrested Tuesday at a hotel in Marietta, Ga., on charges of child exploitation, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. He was placed on leave pending the investigation’s outcome. It was not immediately clear if he has a lawyer. GEORGIA MURDER SUSPECT TAUNTS ALLEGED VICTIM’S FAMILY, ‘DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD?’ Authorities said Newson was trying to meet with a teen girl he met on a dating app but she was really an undercover officer working for the FBI Metro Atlanta Child Exploitation Task Force. An arrest warrant stated the officer “gave Newson the opportunity to stop communicating several times,” Channel 2 Action News reported. Georgia Department of Defense spokeswoman Desiree Bamba said Newson is on the command staff of the state Air National Guard. FORMER IRS EMPLOYEE IN GEORGIA SENTENCED FOR IDENTITY THEFT “Lt. Col. Newson’s alleged actions do not reflect the values we uphold in the Georgia National Guard,” Bamba said. The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Killer of North Carolina girl, 13, found in jail on unrelated charge"	" A 34-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the kidnapping and death of a teenage girl in North Carolina last month that set off a three-week search for her. The suspect, identified as Michael Ray McClellan, was already in jail on an unrelated charge when he was charged in the rape, murder and kidnapping of Hania Aguilar, FOX 46 of Charlotte reported in a Twitter message early Saturday. It was not immediately clear what charges McClellan will face or how he came into contact with the 13-year-old. Hania Aguilar was waiting outside her Lumberton mobile home park on Nov. 5 when she was kidnapped. After a three-week search, her body was found off a rural road, seven miles away, the Charlotte Observer reported. Meanwhile, the dead girl's family was struggling with a separate matter: Her father, Noe Aguilar, was denied a visa so he could travel from Guatemala, where he resides, to attend her funeral in North Carolina on Saturday, his lawyer said. Noe Aguilar traveled to the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala on Monday to ask for an expedited visa to enter the U.S. for the funeral, but U.S. officials determined he lacked strong ties to his home country and denied him on the spot, his attorney Naimeh Salem told the New York Times. “To tell you the truth, with past administrations, we never had a problem like this. With this administration, most everything that is discretionary is getting denied,"" Salem, an immigration lawyer based in Texas, said, referring to the Trump administration's policy on entry to the U.S. A petition on Change.org requesting that the father be allowed to enter the country collected more than 57,000 signatures as of early Saturday. VISA DENIALS PREVENTED NAVY VET'S MOM FROM ATTENDING HIS FUNERAL, DAD SAYS ""No parent should be denied the right to attend their child’s funeral -- especially when Hania was a Citizen-born in Tennessee,"" the petition states. Guatemalan residents must receive a special visa to enter the U.S. Noe Aguilar lived in the U.S. when his daughter was an infant but moved back to Guatemala in 2005, according to the Times. In his visa application, he said owned a business and had no intention of overstaying. “He has no negative immigration history,” Salem said. “No deportation. He has never attempted to come back to the U.S. He has no desire to come to the U.S. He wanted to kiss his daughter goodbye.”"	nonTerrorism	Crime
Navy CPO’s death ruled murder; ex-fiancé arrested	"The death of a Navy chief petty officer whose body was discovered in her Florida home in September has been ruled a homicide, leading authorities Friday to arrest the man to whom she was engaged, reports said. Nearly three months after Andrea Washington, 37, was discovered dead in her home on Jacksonville’s Northside, police charged 36-year-old Danny Ray Beard with her murder, First Coast News reported. While a cause of death was not immediately released in September, investigators had said her death ""was not from natural causes.” No suspects were initially named. A judge had granted the Navy chief a protective order about two weeks before her death due to “domestic violence at her home,” the station reported. Washington said she was pushed, kicked in the stomach and “had a gun pulled on her by a man she was living with” while arguing over household bills, First Coast News reported, citing the protective order filed Sept. 4. LONG ISLAND MAN WHO FOUND BONES IN HIS BASEMENT OPENS UP ABOUT GRISLY FIND She also filed a separate police report against Beard on Sept. 2 for aggravated assault after encouragement from a friend, the media outlet reported. Washington was slated to appear in court on the protective order against Beard just hours after she was found dead, First Coast News reported. Beard appeared in court to defend himself and the order was dismissed because Washington, who was dead, did not attend. NORTH CAROLINA MAN WHO BEAT UP WOMAN -- THEN CALLED HER 223 TIMES FROM JAIL -- SENTENCED TO PRISON Phantom McClendon, a family friend of Washington, told First Coast News that the mother of three was newly “pinned” as a Navy CPO. “The goal of making chief is a major accomplishment and for her to make it after all these years,"" McClendon said, ""and the simple fact (is) that she can’t even enjoy it.”"	nonTerrorism	Crime
James Fields guilty of first-degree murder in Charlottesville car attack at white nationalist rally	"Just over a year after he plowed his vehicle into a crowd protesting a white nationalist rally, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer, James Alex Fields Jr. was convicted Friday of first-degree murder and other felonies – and now faces the possibility of life in prison. A jury needed a little more than seven hours to convict Fields, of Maumee, Ohio, in the killing of Heyer during a “Unite the Right” rally in Virginia on Aug. 12, 2017. He was also found guilty of five counts of aggravated malicious wounding, three counts of malicious wounding and a count of leaving the scene of an accident. Fields faces life in prison. During closing arguments Thursday, prosecutor Nina-Alice Antony portrayed Fields as a hateful young man who idled his vehicle for more than a minute before backing up and then speeding into the crowd, killing Heyer and injuring dozens of other people. Video from a Virginia State Police helicopter captured the incident, showing a grey muscle car as it rammed the group and then drove away. Antony also referenced a text message sent by Fields the day before the rally after his mother told him to be careful. In the text, accompanied by a picture of Adolf Hitler, Fields wrote: “we’re not the one (sic) who need to be careful.” Antony also repeatedly reminded jurors about a meme Fields posted on Instagram three months before the crash. The image showed a crowd, identified as “protesters,” being rammed by a car, and depicted bodies being tossed in the air. ""What we have is a man who had a decision, and he decides to turn his Instagram post into reality,"" she said. Defense attorney Denise Lunsford urged the jury to consider the chaos of the day, including the use of tear gas and a series of street fights between white nationalists, Antifa activists and counter-protesters. Lunsford said Fields only drove into the crowd out of fear after finding himself alone and unprotected. “Look at the circumstances as they appeared to him,” Lunsford said. “He says he felt he was in danger, there were people coming at him.” On Thursday, she urged the jury to find Fields guilty of “no more than” the lesser charges of manslaughter in Heyer’s death and unlawful wounding for the injuries to others. The “Unite the Right” rally was organized to protest plans to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Mugshot of Ohio woman with unique face tattoos goes viral after Walmart shoplifting arrest	"An Ohio woman who was recently taken into custody is arguably receiving more attention for her mugshot than for her alleged crime. Alyssa Zebrasky was arrested Wednesday after she allegedly shoplifted from a Walmart in Boardman Township, authorities told Fox 8. 'NECK GUY' WHOSE MUGSHOT WENT VIRAL ARRESTED AGAIN Her mugshot has since garnered media attention due to the pronounced tattoos on her face. What appears to be a spider’s web is stretched across her forehead while skull-like features surround her eyes, cover her nose and can be spotted on the sides of her face and on the skin above and below her lips. TEXAS WOMAN ARRESTED FOR MARIJUANA TAKES MUGSHOT, GETS REQUESTS FOR MAKEUP TIPS After Zebrasky, 27, was taken to the Mahoning County Jail following her arrest, officers there found a hypodermic needle and “small bags containing methamphetamine inside her purse,” a police report reviewed by the news station says. This is the woman’s second arrest in recent weeks; she was reportedly arrested in November after leading authorities on a brief car chase, Fox 8 reported at the time."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Suspect in model's strangulation death pleads not guilty	"A man accused of strangling a model in an affluent Philadelphia suburb pleaded not guilty Friday to murder charges, days after a suspect in the burglary of her apartment was taken into custody. Jonathan Harris appeared in a Montgomery County courtroom over the August killing of Christina Carlin-Kraft. Officials have said Carlin-Kraft took a ride-hailing service to Philadelphia, met 31-year-old Harris and the two later returned to her Ardmore apartment. Carlin-Kraft's beaten body was found in her bloodstained bedroom by police who had been called to check on her. A detective testified in October that Harris told him he intended to sell Carlin-Kraft cocaine, but she refused to pay and a fight ensued. According to the warrant filed in Harris' arrest, the two met in downtown Philadelphia just hours before her death early Aug. 22. There was no evidence they previously knew each other. Harris's trial is scheduled for May 6. His attorney, Charles Peruto Jr., said he won't comment, adding ""it's best if I do all the talking in court."" Earlier this week, police arrested a man suspected of burglarizing Carlin-Kraft's home, a crime authorities have said was unrelated to her killing days later. Andre Melton, 31, was arrested in Philadelphia after a months-long manhunt. ""He is not being investigated for the homicide, he's solely being charged with the burglary and theft,"" said Melton's attorney, Lawrence Bozzelli, adding he couldn't comment further. Carlin-Kraft reported a burglary at her apartment on Aug. 18. She told investigators she had taken a Lyft to a Philadelphia hotel bar. After that, Carlin-Kraft said she remembered nothing. She told police she woke up the next morning in her apartment ""extremely sick"" with ""no recollection of what occurred,"" the Philadelphia Inquirer reported . She noticed several items missing, including credit cards, jewelry and designer purses. Surveillance footage shows Carlin-Kraft returning to her apartment early on Aug. 18 with a man police believe was Melton, according to the Inquirer. She seemed unsteady on her feet, and he supported her. The apartment is in one of the Main Line suburbs of Philadelphia. The area historically was home to sprawling estates belonging to Philadelphia's social elite, and its communities are still some of the wealthiest in the country. Melton was arraigned late Thursday and charged with burglary, criminal trespass, and receiving stolen property."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Weinstein's lawyers: New evidence undermines rape charge	"A woman who claims Harvey Weinstein raped her in 2013 attended one of his screenings the same day of the alleged assault, Weinstein's lawyers said Friday in a letter to a New York City judge overseeing his criminal case. The letter says a friend of the alleged victim received an invitation to the screening and responded to an assistant for Weinstein in an email that the two would attend. When the email came to its attention, the defense team interviewed the friend, who confirmed that they went to the event and met up with Weinstein there, the letter says. The account calls into question ""why would an alleged rape victim go out of her way to spend time with her 'rapist' merely hours after she was allegedly attacked,"" the letter said. The letter also claims that the witness had already disclosed the information to New York City Police Department investigators but it was never disclosed to the defense - legal grounds for dismissing the charges. The Manhattan district attorney's office responded on Friday with its own letter accusing the defense of trying to distort the core facts of the case. ""That the defendant has a misguided and antiquated view of how a rape victim should react after having been assaulted does not change this reality,"" it read. The filings follows one last month in which Weinstein's lawyers said the same friend told defense investigators that Weinstein and the rape accuser had been ""hooking up"" consensually for a long time and that she never heard the accuser say anything bad about him until last year. The friend has not been identified in the court papers. Prosecutors dropped part of the case in October after evidence surfaced that a detective coached a witness. Three of the five remaining charges stem from the allegations at the heart of the recent defense filings, that Weinstein raped a woman in a hotel room in March 2013. The two other charges allege that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on another woman in 2006 at his Manhattan apartment. Associated Press writer Michael R. Sisak contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Suicide recorded on cell phone sends Utah man to prison	"A Utah man who helped a teenager kill herself and filmed the act to fulfill what prosecutors called a fascination with death was sentenced Friday to at least five years and up to life in prison. Tyerell Joe Przybycien, 19, apologized to the girl's family, saying what he did ""doesn't deserve pity,"" the Deseret News reported. The girl's mother, Sue Bryan, condemned Przybycien as a ""sociopath"" who researched the fatal hanging ahead of time by carefully measuring rope, nooses and trees. ""There are no words to describe the nightmare that I endure,"" Bryan said. ""Every day I wake up and have to live the horror of her death over and over."" Jchandra Brown, 16, was a cheerleader with blue streaks in her hair who loved playing with her young nephews and had been making prom plans before she hung herself in a canyon south of Salt Lake City in May 2017, Bryan said. ""She was an anxious downcast teenager . trying to find her place in the world,"" said prosecutor Chad Grunander. Her former high school classmate was ""the worst person for her in this trying time of her life."" At one point, Przybycien told a friend that helping her kill herself would be ""like getting away with murder,"" prosecutors have said. His grandfather, Larry Przybycien, painted a different picture of him, saying he'd been kind to people over the years, including those with disabilities, and his family wanted him to come home, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. The young man's use of alcohol and drugs combined with his developing teen brain, led to ""poor decisions,"" defense attorney Gregory Stewart said. Przybycien had just turned 18 at the time when Brown killed herself. Her body was found by a turkey hunter alongside a cell phone with the video Przybycien made of her passing out and dying. The recording showed him occasionally calling out to her as she inhaled compressed air and stepped off a platform, but not stopping her or trying to help. Przybycien showed up at the scene crying while detectives were investigating. His lawyers argued against a murder charge in the case, saying suicide notes in her handwriting showed she made her own decision. Judge James Brady disagreed and let the charge stand. Przybycien eventually pleaded guilty to child abuse homicide in an agreement with prosecutors. He also pleaded guilty to reduced charges after child pornography was found on his phone during the investigation into Brown's death. He will serve up to five years in that case, though that time will run concurrent with the sentence in Brown's death. In Utah, judges hand down indefinite sentences and a parole board decides when inmates are released. The case carried echoes of a young Massachusetts woman, Michelle Carter, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter last year for encouraging her suicidal boyfriend to kill himself in dozens of text messages when she was a teenager."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"California Sheriff’s Sgt. Ron Helus, killed in bar mass shooting, gunned down by friendly fire: authorities"	"The bullet responsible for killing a Ventura County Sheriff’s sergeant during November's mass shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill was fired by a California Highway Patrol officer, authorities said Friday. Sgt. Ron Helus – who was nearing retirement – was also struck by five rounds from 28-year-old gunman Ian David Long. But it was the sixth round, fired by a fellow law enforcement officer, that struck Helus heart and killed him, Ventura County Sheriff William Ayub said during a Friday press conference. ""It was just a tragic detail that unfolded so rapidly, in my view it was unavoidable,"" Ayub said. ""They were ambushed almost immediately."" Helus responded to the scene after Long stormed into the Thousand Oaks bar Nov. 7 and sprayed the crowd with gunfire, killing 12 people. CALIFORNIA SHERIFF'S SGT. RON HELUS KILLED IN BAR SHOOTING, 'DIED A HERO,' MADE LAST CALL TO WIFE Long threw smoke grenades into the crowd, obstructing what they could see before he opened fire. He then used a flashlight with a laser sight attached to his .45-caliber semi-automatic pistol as he fired at the establishment, which was filled mostly with young people dancing to country music. Helus has been credited as being a hero after he rushed into the bar to confront the gunman. Panicked revelers smashed windows, dived under tables and piled on top of each other in an effort to dodge the gunfire. Ayub said the fatal shot did not diminish the heroism shown by the officers. The CHP officer was not identified but is a 9-year veteran of the force who is on leave. The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Crime

Police arrest teen in killing of sales rep at model home	"Authorities on Friday arrested a Maryland teenager in the fatal shooting of a builder's representative inside a suburban model home, a killing that's rattled real estate agents and others who sell the kind of properties where the victim was attacked. Police in Anne Arundel County identified the arrested suspect as Dillon Nicholas Augustyniak, an 18-year-old from the Maryland town of Jessup. He was captured early Friday in Baltimore and charged with first-degree murder, armed robbery and other charges. Investigators allege he fatally shot Steven Wilson, 33, in the model home where he was working late Wednesday afternoon. The married father of two young children, who was employed as a sales and marketing representative for builder Ryan Homes, was pronounced dead at the scene. Police Chief Timothy Altomare said robbery was the motive. In charging documents, police allege the teen stole Wilson's phone and laptop and investigators believe he tried to sell the gun he used in the killing. It wasn't immediately clear if Augustyniak had an attorney. Friday calls to the suspect's possible relatives went unanswered. Police had no indication that other model homes or real estate offices were being targeted. Altomare portrayed the robbery and slaying as impulse meeting opportunity on the part of a violent criminal. ""While I won't say that real estate agents shouldn't be vigilant and concerned, as I think everyone should for their safety, we have no indication that there's a particular threat to the industry at this time,"" the county police chief told reporters Friday. Bob Johnston, CEO of the Anne Arundel County Association of Realtors, said Wilson was not a licensed real estate agent, but a builder's representative tasked with marketing and selling his employer's homes. ""It's still a real estate-related thing, there's no question about it. And we're extremely concerned and putting that out to our members because it could have been one of them,"" Johnston told The Associated Press, adding that self-defense trainings were increasingly commonplace in the industry. In the wake of Wilson's killing, real estate agents took to social media to share their anxieties. Tanisha Ashford, who sells homes from her base in Maryland's Upper Marlboro, told the AP she was taking extra precautions, saying the homicide underscored how vulnerable real estate agents and other sellers can be when showing properties. The Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis reported that police wrote in charging documents that someone ""was breathing heavily and sounded to be in distress"" during the 911 call that alerted them to the model home where Wilson was found. As the dispatcher tried to figure out what was going on, another voice in the background could be heard saying: ""Where is the money"" and ""Who are you talking to?"" Altomare said investigators were able to make an arrest some 31 hours after Wilson's battered body was found due to the involvement of multiple community tipsters ""giving us pieces of the puzzle."" Wilson's family has described him as a ""loving husband, father, son, brother, and friend."" A spokesman for the parent company of Ryan Homes, Virginia-based NVR Inc., declined to comment."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Tennessee inmate who chose fried chicken, electric chair death is executed"	"A Tennessee death row inmate who requested to die via the electric chair was executed Thursday night. David Earl Miller, 61, was pronounced dead at 7:25 p.m. in Nashville, correction officials said. Miller, who spent 36 years on the state's death row, the longest of any inmate, was the third inmate to be executed this year in the state. TENNESSEE DEATH ROW INMATE 2ND TO CHOOSE ELECTRIC CHAIR OVER LETHAL INJECTION IN STATE When asked by the warden if he had any last words, Miller — whose last meal consisted of fried chicken, mashed potatoes, biscuits and coffee — said: ""Beats being on death row."" He was convicted of killing Lee Standifer, 23, in 1981 in Knoxville. Standifer was a mentally handicapped woman who had been on a date with Miller the night she was repeatedly beaten, stabbed and dragged into a wooded area. Miller, in a handwritten note last month, requested to die via electric chair, rather than by lethal injection. Inmates in Tennessee whose crimes were committed before 1999 can choose electrocution over lethal injection. He became the second person to request electrocution over lethal injection in Tennessee, behind Edmund Zagorski, who was put to death on Nov. 1. A clemency application made on behalf of Miller's legal team was denied by Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam last week. Miller’s attorney asked for mercy on behalf of the inmate, saying if the convicted killer was tried today he would not be sentenced to death and “it is likely he would not even be convicted of first-degree murder."" The request, filed last week, argued Miller had “severe mental illness” at the time of the crime and “accepts responsibility for the death of his friend."" His lawyer asked Miller’s life be spared so he can live the remainder of his years in prison. The U.S. Supreme Court also refused to halt execution plans for Miller, lawyers for whom previously filed two applications seeking to stop it. The court, in an emailed statement, said the request for a stay was denied, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissenting.

"Michigan authorities search two cemeteries, uncover dozens of fetuses' remains"	"Authorities in Michigan revealed Thursday that they uncovered multiple fetuses' remains at two separate funeral homes. The discovery was made as part of the ongoing investigation into the Perry Funeral Home, Detroit Police Chief James Craig said in a news conference, which was posted to the department’s Facebook page. The remains of 63 bodies inside three boxes and a deep freezer were found at the location earlier this year following a raid. A law enforcement task force, acting on a tip, executed a search warrant at the Gethsemane Cemetery in Detroit on Wednesday, Craig said. Authorities also believed “based on the tip that there may have been fetuses at” the Knollwood Cemetery in Canton, he added. No search warrant was served at Knollwood, Craig said. “When we responded after serving our search warrant, we did discover 104 fetuses,” Craig said. After combing through the related paperwork, authorities determined that documentation pertaining to 17 of the fetuses “had some discrepancies,” he said. “The remaining 87 did not have any discrepancies and total 104 fetuses, our investigation revealed that those fetuses were all associated with Perry Funeral Home,” Craig said. “As it relates to the Canton location, the investigators found 345 fetuses, one adult. And of that number, 27 were found in violation because of documentation that had discrepancies as well.” The police chief told reporters that there were “no criminal allegations against the cemetery.” “This is an extension of our criminal probe focusing on Perry. There are no criminal allegations against the management companies that manage both Gethsemane and Knollwood,” Craig said. “The only connection is the fact that they have the same management company and the fact that the investigation did take us to those locations.” The Perry Funeral Home is owned by James Vermeulen and his legal representation, Collins Einhorn Farrel law firm, released a statement to WXYZ saying that the allegations “are inaccurate.” “These allegations involve only unclaimed infant remains. Perry Funeral Home received these remains from local hospitals who had indicated to Perry that the remains were ‘unclaimed’ by the parents,” the statement said. “In other words, the hospitals had informed Perry that the hospitals had reached out to the parents by certified mail and/or by phone, and the families did not respond. We do not believe that any of these remains involve families that paid Perry for funeral services.” Regarding unclaimed remains, a funeral home isn’t permitted to bury remains without getting proper approval and “Perry never received the legal authority necessary to conduct a final disposition of the remains,” the statement said. “Perry has conducted itself within the law and has not committed any criminal offenses,” the statement said."	nonTerrorism	Crime
6-month-old found floating face up in pond after dad confesses to watching her sink: police	"A 6-month-old baby girl was found alive-- floating on her back-- in a Northwestern Missouri pond Monday just minutes after her father allegedly confessed to police that he had drowned her, Kansas City's Fox 4 reported. At around 10 a.m., Jonathon Zicarelli, 28, walked into the Greenwood Police Department’s office and allegedly admitted to trying to drown his daughter, the report said. Within minutes, police determined the location of the pond and found the baby floating face up. Police Chief Greg Hallgrimson said the baby looked like a “porcelain doll” and appeared to be in a state of shock. Corporal T. Calhoun began performing CPR and the baby began breathing normally, The Kansas City Star reported. Police said the baby had grass in her mouth, mud in her eyes and water in her lungs. Responding officers wrapped her in Calhoun’s uniform shirt for more heat and a local fire department transferred the baby to a hospital for severe hypothermia. Police estimated she had been in the water for about 10 minutes. Zicarelli allegedly told investigators he had planned to kill his daughter for over 24 hours. He said he had parked his car and walked to the pond three times to determine if he could drown her. He said that he put her in the pond and watched her sink before leaving.

"Friends' star David Schwimmer's lookalike skips court appearance, warrant issued"	"No one told him life was gonna be this way. An arrest warrant was issued Tuesday for a British theft suspect -- whose image went viral on social media due to the man's resemblance to “Friends” star David Schwimmer -- after he failed to show up for a court appearance. Abdulah Husseni, 36, failed to appear in court in Blackpool on Tuesday to face charges of theft and fraud. He was arrested in Southall in November on suspicion of theft. The man’s face became world famous after police published surveillance footage of a man carrying what appeared to be a case of beer from a restaurant in Blackpool. He was wanted for allegedly stealing a jacket, wallet and cellphone from a restaurant. Fans of the 1994-2004 sitcom said they knew exactly who the alleged thief was – Ross Geller, the fictional character played by Schwimmer. Many Twitter users began making “Friends”-related jokes -- especially revolving around the show's catchy theme song, ""I'll Be There For You."" “I don't think it's been this guy's day, his week, his month or even his year,” one fan wrote in one of the 101,000 comments that were left on the post, according to the BBC. Police later confirmed Schwimmer was off the hook...but not before the 52-year-old actor took to Twitter in an attempt to “clear” himself. “Officers, I swear it wasn't me. As you can see, I was in New York. To the hardworking Blackpool Police, good luck with the investigation,” he wrote below a video of him getting beer from a grocery store, a la the British suspect.

3 illegal immigrants indicted for murder of American whistleblower: report	"Three illegal immigrants were indicted for the murder of a whistleblower in Georgia who reported that one of the immigrants ran a scheme to employ other illegal immigrants and defrauded a tree service company. Brothers Pablo Rangel-Rubio, 49, and Juan Rangel-Rubio, 42, both residents of Rincon, Ga., and Higinio Perez-Bravo, 49, of Savannah, were charged on Thursday, said Southern District of Georgia U.S. Attorney Bobby L. Christine. They are accused of murdering Eliud Montoya, 41, who was reportedly shot near his home, sparking an investigation by the authorities. Montoya, a naturalized American citizen, filed a formal complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claiming that Pablo Rangel-Rubio employed illegal immigrants at a tree service company, profited from the company and took a share of the illegal workers’ pay, WSAV reported. The authorities accuse Rangel-Rubio of paying Perez-Bravo to help his brother to kill Montoya for reporting their alleged scheme that authorities said enriched the brothers by more than $3.5 million over 10 years. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT KILLED 3 AFTER 'SANCTUARY' RELEASE FROM CUSTODY, ICE SAYS “Eliud Montoya was a naturalized citizen of the United States who worked hard and raised a family,” said Christine, WSAV reported. “He went to the proper authorities to report a federal crime and for that he was murdered. Our office is committed to ensuring justice for Eliud Montoya, a man killed for doing the right thing, by those intent on protecting their illegal profits,” he added. Pablo Rangel-Rubio and Juan Rangel-Rubio are charged with conspiracy to retaliate against a witness, conspiracy to kill a witness, conspiracy to conceal, harbor and shield illegal aliens, and money laundering conspiracy, the outlet reported. Perez-Bravo and one of the brothers who allegedly did the killing were also charged with conspiracy to commit murder for hire. Pablo Rangel-Rubio is also charged with three counts of money laundering transactions over $10,000. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ICE WANTED DEPORTED IS NOW CHARGED IN WIFE'S STABBING DEATH A number of federal agencies helped with the investigation into the murder of Montoya. The probe was headed by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and assisted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the FBI, the United States Marshals Service, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI), the Garden City Police Department, the Effingham County Sheriff's Office, and the Chatham County Sheriff's Office. “As Homeland Security Investigations has stated repeatedly – HSI equally focuses its worksite enforcement efforts on those who illegally work in the U.S., as well as the employers who knowingly hire them,” said HSI Atlanta Special Agent in Charge Nick S. Annan, according to the outlet. “This case is an extreme, but clear example of how far certain criminals seeking to illegally exploit the U.S. labor market will go to protect their ill-gotten gains, and illustrates why worksite enforcement will continue to be a major priority for HSI.”"	nonTerrorism	Crime
Alleged California serial killer to keep public defender	"A suspected California serial killer cannot afford a private attorney, a judge ruled Thursday, keeping in place a public defender in a case expected to cost taxpayers $20 million. Joseph DeAngelo, a former police officer facing 26 murder and kidnapping charges, could be required to reimburse the county to the extent he is able after the trial, Judge Michael Sweet said in Sacramento Superior Court. DeAngelo, 73, stood in an orange jumpsuit inside a courtroom cage. He appeared to have lost weight in jail since his arrest in April. Sacramento County has asked the state to pick up the cost of prosecuting and defending DeAngelo, a county official said Wednesday. Authorities believe he committed 13 murders and more than 50 rapes in the 1970s and 80s spanning six California counties. The rape cases happened too long ago to be prosecuted, so prosecutors brought 13 related kidnapping counts. Diane Howard, the public defender who has represented him since his arrest, did not comment after Thursday's hearing. She represented DeAngelo in court alongside two other defense attorneys. Prosecutors from all six California counties where DeAngelo was charged — Sacramento, Santa Barbara, Orange, Ventura, Tulare and Contra Costa — appeared in court. The parties are next due in court April 10. Howard submitted a sealed affidavit detailing DeAngelo's economic situation that Sweet used to make his determination. The search for the serial killer, known by nicknames such as the East Area Rapist and the Golden State Killer, vexed authorities for decades and left victims' families without answers. Finally in early 2018 investigators used DNA and a genealogical website to identify and arrest DeAngelo. The serial killer would monitor suburban neighborhoods and sneak into homes at night, authorities said. If a couple was home, he would tie up the man, place dishes on his back and threaten to kill both victims if he heard the plates fall onto the floor while he raped the woman."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Border Patrol agent won't be tried a third time in teen's death	"Federal prosecutors on Thursday said they would not pursue another trial against a Border Patrol agent who fatally shot a Mexican teenager across a border fence but who was twice acquitted. A filing in court shows prosecutors say they will no longer pursue the case against Lonnie Swartz, the agent who killed 16-year-old Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez in October 2012. ""Agent Swartz is relieved and looking forward to moving on with his life without the threat of criminal prosecution hanging over his head,"" his attorney, Sean Chapman, said in an email to The Associated Press. In April, Swartz was acquitted of second-degree murder, but a jury deadlocked on manslaughter charges. Prosecutors re-tried Swartz on voluntary and involuntary manslaughter charges. They said Swartz lost his cool when he became frustrated at rock-throwers from the Mexican side of the border while on the job. The second trial, which began in October, ended with a not guilty verdict on the involuntary charge, but the jury again deadlocked on voluntary manslaughter. Swartz was the rare agent who was prosecuted for use of force. The shooting, and his indictment three years later, came at a time when the Border Patrol was increasingly under scrutiny for its use of force, especially pertaining to rock-throwers, or people on the Mexican side of the border who throw rocks to distract agents. Swartz's attorney said he was acting in self-defense and following Border Patrol policy when he fired at least 16 shots at Elena Rodriguez through the slats of a border fence dividing Nogales, Ariz., and Nogales, Sonora. Prosecutors said Elena Rodriguez was throwing rocks at Swartz and other law enforcement officers who were on scene chasing a suspected drug smuggler in an effort to distract them. The boy's family still denies that he was involved. They say his killing was not justified. The announcement on Nov. 21 that the jury had found Swartz not guilty on involuntary manslaughter but had deadlocked on voluntary manslaughter was met with protests from activists who marched through downtown and shut down a busy intersection."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Avenatti agrees to give up assets to estranged wife	"Michael Avenatti has agreed to turn over to his estranged wife a corporate jet, Ferrari and other assets as part of their divorce settlement. Orange County Judge Carol Henson on Tuesday accepted the agreement stipulating that some of Avenatti's assets be liquidated and sold for back child and spousal support. He also must pay at least $80,000 to Lisa Storie-Avenatti by Jan. 2. Avenatti, who represents porn star Stormy Daniels in her lawsuit against President Donald Trump, previously agreed to pay Storie-Avenatti more than $150,000 a month in child and spousal support. Among the assets Avenatti is turning over are a 2017 Ferrari GT Spider, five watches including a Rolex that retails for $12,000, a sculpture by famed architect Frank Gehry and a six-seat business jet worth millions. Avenatti stressed that development was an agreed-upon deal as part of his divorce proceedings. He said he and his ex-wife came to an agreement, known as a stipulation, in which certain assets would be transferred to her and she would sell them. The court then approved the deal. ""This was done by way of a negotiated consensual agreement. I wasn't ordered to do anything,"" he said. The 47-year-old Avenatti announced Tuesday that he's not running for president following a couple tumultuous weeks for the attorney, who has been a scathing Trump critic. Avenatti was arrested on Nov. 14 on a felony domestic violence charge stemming from allegations he roughed up a girlfriend. Prosecutors declined to bring felony charges against him in the case, but they are still investigating whether he should face a misdemeanor charge. Avenatti has vehemently denied wrongdoing. On Monday, Trump's attorneys asked a judge for nearly $800,000 in attorneys' fees and penalties from Daniels for her failed defamation lawsuit, which was filed by Avenatti. Daniels has appealed the decision tossing the lawsuit, and Avenatti has said he expects to prevail at a higher court. Avenatti tweeted that he made the decision not to run for president in 2020 at the urging of his family, and if not for their concerns, he would go for it. Daniels has said she had an affair with President Donald Trump in 2006, a claim Trump denies.

Prosecutors: Sex assault was motive for scenic inn killing	"An aspiring chef slain over the summer at a North Carolina mountain inn died during a sexual assault by a co-worker, prosecutors said Thursday, offering new details on the motive for the killing at the height of tourism season along a famed scenic highway. New charges filed this week in federal court could also allow authorities to seek the death penalty in the slaying that took place steps from the Blue Ridge Parkway. The new superseding indictment adds two counts of aggravated sexual abuse resulting in death against 21-year-old Derek Shawn Pendergraft, and it charges him with first-degree murder. He was previously charged with second-degree murder, which would have carried a maximum of life in prison. Prosecutors said in a news release that they haven't yet decided whether to pursue a death sentence. The indictment said that Pendergraft killed Sara Ellis on July 24 during the course of a sexual assault. Prosecutors write that Ellis was ""particularly vulnerable due to her ... hearing impairment."" A cause of death hasn't been released. Pendergraft had initially told authorities the two went for a hike near the Pisgah Inn where both worked, and that he lost track of Ellis after she turned back in the rain. After he informed inn managers she was missing, authorities found the victim's body off an embankment near the parkway. Family and friends said that Ellis, 29, was an aspiring chef from Florida who loved to bake and watch cooking shows. She saw the seasonal job at the inn as a way to advance a career in restaurants, they said. A close friend of Ellis, Nicole de Giovine, said Thursday that the death has been crushing for family and friends — especially Sara's twin sister, Rachel, who has coped by limiting her exposure to developments in the criminal probe. ""Sara's death has been devastating to her, and she is not ready to know the details of the case,"" de Giovine said in an email, adding that knowing her sister was sexually assaulted would ""only devastate her further."" The death also rattled a group of young, seasonal employees who had come from around the country to work at the inn operated under contract with the National Park Service, its owner Bruce O'Connell said over the summer. He said about half of the inn's 100 employees live on-site in dorm-style rooms at the property, which is about 30 minutes from surrounding towns. Pendergraft, who's from Asheville about 45 minutes northeast, had been working as a housekeeper at the inn."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Utah woman, 32, tricked ex-husband into leaving house so she could sneak in and kill new girlfriend, cops say"	"A Utah woman accused of fatally shooting her ex-husband’s new girlfriend in front of the former couple's children was able to gain access to the woman's location by tricking her ex-husband into leaving the apartment -- allowing the jilted lover to sneak inside for the slaying, prosecutors said. Chelsea Watrous Cook, 32, was charged with aggravated murder, burglary and violence in the presence of a child in the murder of Lisa Vilate Williams. Williams was killed in a Salt Lake City apartment on Nov. 25. Cook, a high school health teacher, reportedly drew her ex-husband Travis Cook outside his apartment by messaging him that she'd be dropping off cold medicine for the former couple's 3-year-old twins. When Travis Cook walked to the parking lot, Chelsea snuck into the home and refused to leave. When her ex-husband returned inside, she locked herself in the bathroom while he called 911. Then, less than a minute later, she suddenly walked out, grabbed a gun from her coat and fired the fatal shots. When she was killed, Williams was standing by a Christmas tree she was decorating with Travis and Chelsea's 3-year-old girls standing next to her. Cook’s ex-husband told the children to run to their rooms and lock the doors. In the meantime, he pinned his ex-wife to the wall and waited for police to arrive. Williams died later that night at a hospital. Williams’ family told the Associated Press that Cook had harassed the 26-year-old woman online, on the phone and in person for months before the shooting. They said the harassment started in June and included confrontations at the bank where Williams worked as a teller, bullying on Instagram and phone calls made from the high school where Cook worked. “I worried for her safety every day,” said Williams' mother, Tawny Williams. Court records show Travis and Chelsea had their divorce finalized in January. Travis Cook and Lisa Williams had been dating for six months before her murder. “I spoke to her an hour or so before it all happened, and she was so excited … to give those kids something happy,” the victim’s sister, Bekah Williams, told the Associated Press. She said her sister had been reluctant to report Cook’s behavior to the police, worried that involving authorities could make the situation harder on the children. Bekah Williams added: “In hindsight, I think the best thing for the kids would have been to call the police every time."" The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Crime
American priest accused of sexually assaulting altar boys arrested in the Philippines	"An American Catholic priest who's lived in a remote Philippines town for nearly four decades was reportedly arrested Thursday after being accused of sexually assaulting several altar boys. Philippines immigration officials said Rev. Kenneth Bernard Hendricks, who has been indicted in Ohio for alleged illicit sexual conduct in the Philippines, was arrested in a church in Naval town on the island province of Biliran. Hendricks had previously lived in Ohio but was not ordained a priest until he left the U.S. An Ohio court issued a warrant for the 77-year-old stemming from complaints made by Filipino minors who said they were victimized by Hendricks. The priest was flown to Manila and detained in an immigration cell. Hendricks stands accused of abusing seven minors, most of whom served as altar boys in the Naval church, and faces 50 counts of molestation, according to Philippines Bureau of Immigration spokesperson Dana Sandoval. “The victims were in his house and the abuses were committed while he was taking a bath with each of them,” she told the Associated Press. U.S. authorities provided information about the alleged sexual assaults to Philippines officials, Sandoval added. The U.S. Embassy, which did not immediately react to the news of the arrest, may revoke Hendricks’ passport in a bid to help Philippine authorities deport him. “[He is] a fugitive from justice that poses a risk to public safety and security,” Sandoval said. “We will not allow sexual predators to prey on our children. People like him must be kicked out and banned from the Philippines.” The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Ohio woman, 61, poured hot grease on person during dispute, cops say"	"A 61-year-old Ohio woman -- who was already wanted on a pair of outstanding criminal warrants -- was booked into jail Sunday after allegedly pouring hot grease on someone she'd been arguing with. Charlene Thompson was charged with felonious assault and booked into the Hamilton County jail, FOX19 reported. Cincinnati police said Thompson and the victim – who was not identified – got into an argument at a residence in Cincinnati on Sunday. The subject of the argument wasn't immediately clear, but, at some point, the fight escalated and Thompson tossed the grease onto her antagonist, officials said. The victim suffered severe burns to the back and arms, and the injuries were visible to authorities upon arriving at the scene. Prosecutors pressed for a ""high bond"" for Thompson during a court appearance Wednesday. “As the court is well aware, burns are some of the most devastating, painful, debilitating, long-term injuries that someone can suffer,” Assistant Hamilton County Prosecutor David Wood said, according to FOX19. The judge set Thompson’s bond at $15,000 and ordered her to keep away from the victim. Thompson was accused in separate 2016 and 2017 incidents of breaking a neighbor's window with rocks and was charged with assault in 2008, FOX19 reported. The outcomes of those cases weren't immediately clear. She was charged in 2006 after allegedly striking her daughter in the mouth and head on Christmas Eve, though the case was later dismissed."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Attack in tire shop shows Utah's hate crime law is 'worthless,' prosecutor says"	"An attack against a Latino man and his son prompted some Utah officials to deem a state hate crime statute ineffective because it can be applied only to misdemeanors. “The statute that we have is such an untenable and unworkable statute that we have not had a successful prosecution of a hate crime for the last 20 years at the state level,” Sim Gill, district attorney for Salt Lake County, told the New York Times. “It is worthless. It is not worth the paper it is written on.” On Nov. 27, Alan Covington walked into Lopez Tires in Salt Lake City and shouted: “I’m here to kill a Mexican” before attacking Jose Lopez and his teenage son Luis with a 3-foot metal pole, authorities said. The younger Lopez was sent to a hospital in critical condition with lacerations and face fractures. His father bled from his face and was “gurgling and coughing on his own blood.” He was released from a hospital Friday. Covington, 50, an African-American, said he targeted the shop because he believed it was part of a conspiracy against him by the Mexican Mafia prison gang. Prosecutors have charged him with three felonies in connection with the attack, two counts of second-degree assault and unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon. He also faces two misdemeanor drug crimes, according to charging documents. He could face more than 26 years in prison. He was being held on $100,000 bond. Gill said the hate crime statute in Utah can be applied only to misdemeanors, meaning an assault like the one that allegedly occurred to Lopez can’t be categorized as a hate crime, he said. “You would think a hate crime is the most egregious kind of conduct and you would want to be able to apply it that way,” he said. Attempts have been made to amend the law, most recently in 2016, which was inspired by an attack on a group of gay men in Salt Lake City. That failed effort was led by Stephen H. Urquhart, a Republican state senator, according to the Times. Urquhart attributed the opposition against the amendment to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Gill said opponents of expanded hate crime laws fear a new law could ""create special rights for people"" or give the government the power ""to police somebody's thoughts,"" the paper reported. “But that’s not what is happening when we have evidence,” he said. Pointing to a case like the attack on the Lopez family, when a suspect is alleged to have explicitly stated a bias during an attack, he added, “I don’t have to speculate about what is going through your mind and what message you are sending.” The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Sierah's Law, targeting violent offenders, advances in Ohio on 85-0 House vote"	"Sierah's Law, a proposal to create Ohio's first geographically searchable registry of violent offenders, advanced Wednesday in an 85-0 House vote, reports said. The bill honors Sierah Joughin, 20, who was abducted and murdered in the summer of 2016. Joughin was riding a bicycle home when she was kidnapped and killed by a man who was previously convicted of abduction, according to Toledo's WTOL-TV and the Toledo Blade. The bill, Senate Bill 231, previously passed in the state Senate but now must return there to incorporate the House version before advancing to the desk of Gov. John Kasich for his signature or veto. The violent offender database would help county law enforcement officers search addresses and other information on offenders convicted of certain violent crimes, the Blade reported. The offenders would have to register annually with the county sheriffs for at least 10 years. Sierah's family believes that had a registry been in place when she was kidnapped, her killer James Worley, might have been questioned sooner, WTOL reported. “During the trial, it was brought to the jury’s attention that this man spent time in prison many years before for an abduction in the same area of the county,” Rep. Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, told the Blade. “Sierah Joughin’s death ripped northwest Ohio as much as anything I’ve ever seen in the 30 years I’ve been there.” After a two-year battle to pass the bill, the victim's mother, Sheila Vculik, told WTOL that her daughter got ""the last word."" “Sierah Joughin’s life made the lives of other better. This law will continue to make the lives of other Ohioans better,” Gavarone said. Derek Merrin of Monclova Township also spoke for the bill, WTOL reported. “Although I never knew Sierah, I have come to admire her. ... She was a treasure in our community and is still deeply missed,"" Merrin told the station. ""Sierah's law is so important. Information is power and Ohioans have the right to know if they have violent offenders living in their midst.”"	nonTerrorism	Crime
Border Patrol agent indicted on capital murder charges after killing 4 women: prosecutors	"A U.S. Border Patrol agent accused of killing four women was indicted Wednesday on a capital murder charge, officials announced. Juan David Ortiz, 35, was arrested in September in Laredo, Texas, and initially charged with four counts of murder, aggravated assault and unlawful restraint in the deaths of the women, but Webb County prosecutors upped the charges after he allegedly confessed to the killings. District Attorney Isidro Alaniz said Wednesday that Ortiz, a Navy veteran, thought he was doing a public service by killing the women, who were identified as sex workers. ""The scheme in this case, from Ortiz's own words, was to clean up the streets of Laredo by targeting this community of individuals who he perceived to be disposable, that no one would miss and that he did not give value to,"" Alaniz said at a news conference. ""The evidence that was presented to the grand jury this morning showed that he killed these four innocent individuals in a cold, callous and calculating way,"" the prosecutor added. Alaniz said that if Ortiz is found guilty of the murders, he'll seek the death penalty. He previously said investigators considered Ortiz a ""serial killer."" 'SERIAL KILLER' BORDER PATROL AGENT ACCUSED OF 4 MURDERS HELP ON $2.5M BOND Ortiz was working as a Border Patrol intel supervisor when he allegedly committed the September slayings. Officials at the time said they were alerted to Ortiz when a fifth woman, identified as Erika Pena, apparently escaped after the agent pulled a gun on her, and asked a nearby state trooper for help. Authorities said Ortiz knew most of the victims and targeted them. Melissa Ramirez, 29; Claudine Luera, 42; Guisela Alicia Cantu, 35; and Janella Ortez, a 28-year-old transgender woman, were all killed. Ortiz, according to court documents, confessed to investigators that he had killed four people.

Man convicted of killing Jordan's dad says trial was unfair	"One of the men convicted of murdering Michael Jordan's father in 1993 argued Wednesday that alibi witnesses and evidence of his innocence weren't given a close enough look during his trial, violating his constitutional rights. A defense attorney for Daniel Green urged a North Carolina judge during oral arguments to allow a wider-ranging evidentiary hearing that could lead to a new trial. Green admits that he helped dump James Jordan's body but maintains he wasn't present when Jordan was fatally shot in the chest. Green's conviction for first-degree murder has previously been upheld by two state courts. Superior Court Judge Winston Gilchrist said he would rule at a later date on whether to allow Green's latest effort to proceed or deny it. Defense attorney Chris Mumma argued Green's right to a fair trial was violated by ineffective counsel who failed to adequately explore ballistics evidence that cast doubt on Green's role or to call testimony by several witnesses who say Green was at a house party when Jordan was killed. She also questioned testimony by a state agent who tested for blood on Jordan's car seats, and she pointed to discrepancies in descriptions of a bullet hole in Jordan's shirt. ""Daniel Green is innocent in the killing of James Jordan. He was not there,"" she told the judge. The violent death shocked fans of James Jordan's world-famous son Michael, who at that point had led the Chicago Bulls to the first three of his six NBA titles. Michael Jordan now owns the NBA's Charlotte Hornets. A representative for Jordan didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Mumma also argued Wednesday that the case against Green hinged on testimony from the other man convicted of the killing, Green's childhood friend Larry Demery, who is also currently serving a life sentence. Mumma said Demery changed his story multiple times and had incentive to lie in hopes of cooperating with prosecutors and avoiding the death penalty. ""The truth has never been heard in this case, and there can be no justice without truth,"" said Mumma, who leads the nonprofit North Carolina Center on Actual Innocence and became involved in the case in recent years. But prosecutors from the state attorney general's office countered that Green, now 44, also changed his story during the investigation and that his trial attorneys did call several alibi witnesses. They disagreed with the ineffective counsel claim, noting that Green's then-defense attorneys also consulted with a firearms expert. They said evidence supported Demery's testimony and Green's trial attorneys had ample chance to cross-examine him about his motives. Prosecutor Danielle Elder said there was ""overwhelming evidence"" that Green killed Jordan as part of a series of crimes that included two other armed robberies, to which Green later pleaded no contest. Green, who wore a brown buttoned shirt and white pants in court, listened quietly and said nothing other than an occasional whispered comment to defense attorneys. The judge said he would reread the hundreds of pages of motions and supporting documents before issuing a ruling. ""I have a large stack of paper from both sides,"" Gilchrist said. During trial, prosecutors used testimony from Demery to identify Green as the triggerman in a deadly robbery of James Jordan early on the morning of July 23, 1993. Jordan's body was found 11 days later in a South Carolina swamp and identified with dental records. Green, who was 18 when Jordan was killed, has said he and Demery were both at a cookout when his friend left to meet someone for a drug deal. Green says he stayed at the party because he was flirting with a woman there. Demery returned hours later, Green said, appearing shaken and asking him to help dispose of Jordan's body in the swamp. Green has said Demery told him he mistook James Jordan for a drug connection and shot him after an altercation. Attorney Hugh Rogers, who represented Demery, told the AP recently that the case pits the men's accounts against each other but ultimately more evidence corroborated his client's version. Prosecutors have maintained that James Jordan was killed as he slept in his parked Lexus along a highway after being targeted for robbery. At Wednesday's hearing, they once again pointed to a video in which Green rapped while wearing an NBA All-Star ring and gold watch that Michael Jordan gave his father. Green says he got the jewelry from the car console days after the killing."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Costa Ricans arrest resort guard in death of Florida woman	" A security guard at a Costa Rica Airbnb rental villa was arrested in the death of a Florida woman who was remembered by friends as an avid world traveler and ""happy soul,"" authorities said Wednesday. Carla Stefaniak of Hallandale Beach, Florida, went to the Central American country to celebrate her 36th birthday but never boarded her Nov. 28 return flight after messaging friends that it was ""pretty sketchy"" at her resort. That prompted her family to raise the alarm with Costa Rican authorities. Officials later found a partially buried body in woods near the Villa le Mas complex and identified it using fingerprints, the country's Judicial Investigation Department said. Stefaniak's family members also traveled to there to help with identification. Security guard Bismark Espinosa Martinez, 32, was arrested in the slaying after he contradicted himself in statements to police, the department said Wednesday. Investigators said blood was found in his nearby apartment. ""What happened to Carla is just unimaginable,"" friend Bugra Demirel of Tallahassee said in a telephone interview. He said Carla was a ""happy soul"" who made everyone laugh and had a large social media presence. Espinosa Martinez, a Nicaraguan immigrant, was working as a security guard at the complex despite lacking the proper documents to be in Costa Rica, department officials said at a news conference in San Jose. He is believed to have lived in Costa Rica since June. Airbnb removed Villa le Mas — a compound with seven vacation apartments — from its site and said Wednesday that it had reached out to family members to offer condolences. Villa Le Mas's attorney, Federico Jenkins, said the owners are cooperating with the authorities in the investigation. Stefaniak, who was an insurance agent, loved to travel and post photos on Instagram. Her trips included visits to Iceland, Switzerland and Mexico, all documented on social media. For her birthday, she and her sister-in-law decided to visit Costa Rica for a short trip. As with her other journeys, Stefaniak posted photos on her Instagram. On Nov. 23, she posted a photo of her looking at the ocean that said, ""Future resident of Costa Rica."" Two days later, her last Instagram picture featured her in a turquoise bathing suit, lying near a pool with tropical plants in the background. ""I'm going to miss the place,"" she wrote. On Nov. 27 — her birthday — Stefaniak's sister-in-law returned home; the two women had booked different return flights on different days. Stefaniak reserved an Airbnb about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the airport in San Jose for her final night in the country. Language wasn't an issue; Stefaniak was born in Venezuela, then moved to Tampa in 2000 with her family and finally settled in South Florida. After her sister-in-law left, an Uber driver took her on a tour of San Jose, then dropped her off at the Airbnb around 5 p.m. on Nov. 27. Demirel said she texted a friend that it was ""raining crazy"" and the power was out. She added that it was ""pretty sketchy here"" and included a picture of the Airbnb. ""Everything she did she always shared with friends and that's when we knew definitely something was up as soon as we lost contact with her,"" Demirel said. After Stefaniak failed to board her Nov. 28 flight to Florida, the family discovered a troubling detail: she had checked in for her flight on the 26th. The family alerted Costa Rican authorities and launched a social media campaign to find her. Then came a break: the hotel guard said he'd last seen Stefaniak at 5 a.m. on Nov. 28 and helped her put her bags into a taxi. But then he changed his story, according to Costa Rican media, and authorities scrutinized the details more. The family wondered why she would have taken a car to the airport at 5 a.m. when her flight was in the afternoon. On Tuesday, a body was found half-buried and covered in plastic in a wooded area about 1,000 feet (305 meters) from the hotel. It was Stefaniak. An autopsy revealed that Stefaniak suffered a blunt force wound to the head and cuts on the neck and arms. On Wednesday, her family worked to bring her body home so they could make funeral arrangements. ""It's too much for us,"" her father, Carlos Stefaniak, told ABC Action News in Tampa from Costa Rica. He showed a photo of his four children — Carla and her sister, and their two brothers. ""That's my team. They are incomplete."" Demirel wondered if the culprit planned to harm Stefaniak from the moment she booked the reservation because her profile photo shows she's ""beautiful"" and she noted in her reservation that she was traveling alone. Airbnb encourages users to post their photos as an ""important way for hosts and guests to learn about each other."" ""I want people to know these things happen,"" he said. ""Girls traveling alone make decisions to stay at places. We want them to be aware of their surroundings. But it is hard to have fun and have your guard up at the same time.""

"Thieves in Washington steal hundreds of bikes, helmets meant for needy kids"	"A group of Grinches stole Christmas from hundreds of less-fortunate children in Washington State on Tuesday, reportedly making off with scores of bikes and helmets. Waste management company Waste Connections of Washington had raised more than $55,000 to buy about 700 new bikes and helmets for children in Clark County this Christmas. The bikes were going to be assembled this Saturday -- until organizers discovered this week that someone broke into the trailer holding the bikes and stole about 200 of them. “Heartbreaking to be honest,” said Waste Connections of Washington's Cyndi Holloway about her feelings when she found out about the theft, FOX12 Oregon reported. “It was heartbreaking, to say the least. I think it is more heartbreaking that you are taking from the kids.” Vancouver Police told FOX12 a street sweeper operator in the area interrupted the theft and contacted employees at the Walmart where the trailer was parked. NEW JERSEY COLLEGE STUDENT DESIGNATED DRIVER KILLED IN CRASH WITH ALLEGED IMPAIRED DRIVER The street sweeper operator reported seeing two people parked in a dark-colored vehicle near the trailer. It was the eighth year the company raised money and built bikes for the community. Organizers are now working with Walmart to try and get replacements for the stolen items by Christmas. “There are little kids throughout Clark County, through different nonprofits organizations that are counting on these bikes,” Holloway told FOX12."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Florida man says ‘voices’ urged him to kill daughter by throwing her off bridge, court records reveal"	"A Florida man claims “voices” urged him to kill his 5-year-old daughter, ultimately leading him to toss her off a bridge to her death in January 2015, court records revealed Tuesday. John Jonchuck told doctors during a two-day evaluation in October 2017 and May 2018 the “voices” told him “everybody in the world” was going to die if he didn’t kill his daughter, Phoebe, the Tampa Bay Times reported. The evaluations were done to determine if the 29-year-old father was mentally stable at the time of the girl's death. “I was hearing voices saying that if me and Phoebe didn’t die, everybody was going to go to hell,” Jonchuck was quoted telling doctors in court records. On Jan. 8, 2015, Jonchuck stopped his car on Dick Misener Bridge in Tampa Bay, took his daughter out of the backseat and dropped her over the edge. The girl plunged 62 feet to her death. Police later stopped Jonchuck and found two Bibles inside his vehicle. Jonchuck told the psychiatrist he still has “bad dreams” about his daughter's death, according to court records. “I think about her every night. In the mornings when I wake up,” he said. “…Because I was a really good father and she loved me so much and I always promised her that I’m not going to let anything happen, and I did.” When asked why he cared that everyone died, he responded: “Because I felt like with that Bible that night I was telling everybody that I was the Creator...Because I felt like the voices were telling me something that was real. Because I didn’t want anybody else to get hurt.” Jonchuck was charged with first-degree murder and is expected to go on trial in March, the Tampa Bay Times reported. His lawyers have argued their client was insane and unaware of the gravity of his actions at the time of Phoebe’s death."	nonTerrorism	Crime
" Steelers fan chokes pregnant Chargers fan at game, photos and video show"	"A Pittsburgh Steelers fan was caught in stunning photos and video choking a pregnant Los Angeles Chargers supporter during Sunday’s game at Pennsylvania's Heinz Field. The altercation appears to begin with a man in a suit emblazoned with Chargers logos fighting a man dressed in blue jeans and wearing a black jacket. At one point, a woman in a Chargers jersey -- who is reportedly pregnant -- steps in the middle of the fracas. As she intervenes, the Steelers fan in the black jacket, who has not been identified, is seen grabbing her throat. Daniel Minshew told the Pittsburgh Current he and the woman, who was not identified, are married and from San Diego. He said he had been “heckled and yelled at prior to the attack” but “never experienced anything” like Sunday's fight. He told the Current he planned to call police and file charges. The Steelers released a statement saying they were cooperating with local authorities to investigate the incident. “We strive to make events at Heinz Field safe for our guests,” the statement said. “This type of behavior seen in the photo is unacceptable and something we do not condone on our property. We are working with Heinz Field security as well as local authorities to gather more information on this particular incident as the Pittsburgh Police determines whether or not to press charges, and we will ensure those involved as the aggressors will not be permitted back into our stadium.” In addition to the choking incident, the game included a number of other brawls in the stands, KDKA-TV reported. The Chargers beat the Steelers, 33-30."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Vehicle chased by Minnesota police crashes into playground, kids in dramatic video"	"Newly released video shows the moment a summer Minneapolis police chase came to a screeching halt with the driver crashing into a playground structure and seriously injuring two children playing nearby. The Minnesota State Patrol released the video Tuesday, which shows troopers trying to pull over 27-year-old Kabaar Powell for speeding on Interstate 94 in Minneapolis before he tried to get away. Powell then ran 22 stop signs and reached speeds of 80 mph before he crashed into the playground structure at Bohanon Park, where Kyle Peltier was playing with his four children on the basketball court. The 27-year-old plowed into three of the children with his vehicle, completely running over Kayden, 2, and partially running over Lillie, 4. The third child, 3-year-old Konnor, suffered non-life threatening injuries, according to FOX9. At Powell's court appearance in which he was sentenced to nearly three years in prison, Peltier told the court his older children no longer want to go to the playground. ""I watched helplessly as my children were run over,"" he said. CHILD IN CRITICAL CONDITION AFTER POLICE CHASE ENDS IN PLAYGROUND CRASH State Patrol said that the number of pursuits have climbed dramatically since 2010, and that it expects to make changes to its pursuit policy after the June incident. “Our policy review is still ongoing,” Col. Matt Langer told FOX9. “The policy we have in place right now today is the same policy we had in place on June 11. I don’t anticipate that policy is going to stay the same, I anticipate that it is going to change. I don’t have, right now today, exact changes that will be made other than to say that that research and that study continues to see what we need to adjust.” The most seriously injured child in the crash, 2-year-old Kayden, left the hospital in August. He was nearly paralyzed but can now walk with assistance, after sustaining a traumatic brain injury. The other two injured children also recovered from their injuries.

Five teens indicted on lynching charges in Virginia mob murder	"Five teenagers – including two minors – were indicted earlier this week on the rarely used charge of “lynching"" after the brutal August murder of a 24-year-old Virginia man. A Prince William County grand jury indicted Terrence Tyrese Martin, 18, of Manassas; Ebelin Jojana Lopez, 19, of Manassas, Seni Jimenez Blanco, 19, of Manassas Park; and two 17-year-old juveniles, who police said will be tried as adults. The names of the juveniles were not immediately released. The quintet was indicted on multiple charges, including lynching, which in Virginia is defined as any act of violence by a group of people that results in someone’s death. It carries the same penalties as second-degree murder, a spokesperson with the Manassas City Police Department said in a statement. Additionally, one of the juveniles was charged with murder. The five teenagers went to the apartment of 24-year-old Reynaldo Eliazar Araujo on Aug. 30 at about 2 a.m. with the intent to rob him, officials said. When police arrived later, they found Araujo’s apartment door riddled with bullet holes and Araujo inside with multiple gunshot wounds. He was pronounced dead at the scene, FOX5DC reported. Police did not elaborate on why they believe the teens were responsible for the killing or any possible connection the accused had to the victim. “What we do know is these younger generations are trying to make a name for themselves, so some of the crimes they are committing are very gruesome, are very violent just so they can build their own reputation because that is what gangs are about – building a reputation of being the baddest gang in the area,” Jay Lanham, executive director of the Northern Virginia regional gang task force, told FOX5DC. “They have no problem committing the crimes they’re committing and the violence that goes along with it and that’s scary. That should be scary for anyone.” Court dates for the suspects are pending."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Texas 7' gang member executed for officer's killing, defiantly quotes Jesus from gurney"	"Nearly two decades after joining a mass prison break in Texas and participating in a subsequent crime spree that led to the murder of a police officer, a member of the notorious ""Texas 7"" gang was executed Tuesday -- but not before he defiantly offered a final prayer while strapped to a gurney. Joseph Garcia, 47, became the 22nd inmate put to death this year in the U.S. and the 12th given lethal injection in Texas. He received the injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville for the December 2000 shooting death of 29-year-old Aubrey Hawkins, an Irving police officer who responded to a robbery Garcia was involved in at a sporting goods store. Hawkins had just finished Christmas Eve dinner with his family when he took the call. Garcia's final words from the gurney included a reference to some of Jesus Christ's last words as he lay dying on the cross, the Houston Chronicle reported. ""Dear heavenly Father, please forgive them, for they know not what they do,"" Garcia said. He was then given the lethal dose and pronounced dead 13 minutes later at 6:43 p.m. Garcia was serving a 50-year sentence for murder when he hooked up with a group of inmates who escaped from a South Texas prison in December 2000 and orchestrated a string of robberies -- including the one in which Hawkins was shot 11 times. The escaped inmates were eventually arrested in Colorado after a six-week manhunt. One member of the group killed himself as officers closed in and the other six were captured, convicted of killing Hawkins and sentenced to death. Garcia is the fourth member of the group to die. Two others remain on death row. FLORIDA STATE TROOPER STRUCK BY CAR, THROWN IN AIR AFTER PUSHING BYSTANDER OUT OF WAY, STUNNING VIDEO SHOWS Garcia's legal team in recent weeks launched several appeals to stop the execution, but the state's parole board rebuffed a request for clemency Friday. In the weeks before the scheduled execution, Garcia also wrote to the Chronicle, asking if it was right he be put to death for ""something that I did not do."" ""I am on death row because of the actions and intent of others and because I am one of the Texas Seven, case closed,"" Garcia wrote. Toby Shook, the lead prosecutor who handled Garcia's case and the five others who were tried, told the Associated Press that, while authorities couldn't narrow down which escaped inmate used which gun to shoot Hawkins, the inmates acted as a team to commit the robbery during which the officer's murder occurred. ""He was up to his ears in murder and mayhem out there. He was actively participating in everything,"" said Shook, now a defense attorney in Dallas. Family and friends of Hawkins told the Chronicle that Garcia's decision to participate in the robbery and murder was clear. ""Whatever participation he had, he went along with it,"" Seagoville police Sgt. Karl Bailey told the paper. ""The whole thing was sparked by the escape from prison, the burglaries -- it was a crime spree."" The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Crime

"Trump administration moves to ban sale of bump stocks, make possession illegal by March"	"The Trump administration on Tuesday took first steps to ban the sale of bump stocks on semi-automatic weapons and has made them illegal to possess beginning in late March. Bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly like automatic firearms, have come under increasing scrutiny after they were used in October 2017 when a man opened fire from his Las Vegas hotel suite into a crowd at a country music concert below, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. “Following the mass shooting in Las Vegas, ATF received correspondence from members of the United States Congress, as well as nongovernmental organizations, requesting that ATF examine its past classifications and determine whether bump-stock type devices available on the market constitute machineguns under the statutory definition,” the regulation, which was signed by Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker on Tuesday morning, noted. It continued: “The Department decided to move forward with the rulemaking process to clarify the meaning of these terms, which are used in the NFA's  (National Firearms Act) statutory definition of ‘machinegun.’” The regulation will go into effect 90 days after it is formally published in the Federal Register, which is expected to happen on Friday, a Justice Department official said. People who own bump stocks will be required to either surrender them to the ATF or destroy them by late March, the official said. The change has undergone a legal review and the Justice Department and ATF are ready to fight any legal challenge that may be brought, the official added. In March, President Donald Trump said his administration would ""ban"" the devices, which he said ""turn legal weapons into illegal machines."" Shortly after the president's comments, the Justice Department announced that it had started the process to amend federal firearms regulations to define bump stocks as machine guns. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives sought public comment on the proposal, drawing more than 35,000 comments. The amended regulations reverse a 2010 ATF decision that found bump stocks did not amount to machine guns and could not be regulated unless Congress changed existing firearms law or passed a new one. In the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting, there was a growing push by some members of Congress to ban bump stocks, but no legislation was passed. At least 10 states have sought their own restrictions on the devices. Police said the gunman in the Las Vegas massacre, Stephen Paddock, fired for more than 10 minutes using multiple weapons outfitted with target scopes and bump stocks. Paddock fatally shot himself after the shooting and there were 23 assault-style weapons, including 14 fitted with rapid-fire bump stock devices, strewn about the room near his body on the floor of his 32nd-floor hotel suite at the Mandalay Bay casino-hotel. The largest manufacturer of bump stocks, Slide Fire Solutions, announced in April that it was going to stop taking orders and shutting down its website. The remaining stock of the devices is now being sold by another company, RW Arms, based in Fort Worth, Texas. The Associated Press contributed to that report."	nonTerrorism	Crime

Report: 53 journalists killed worldwide so far in 2018	" The number of journalists killed worldwide in retaliation for their work nearly doubled this year, according to an annual report by the Committee to Protect Journalists. The New York-based organization found that 34 journalists were killed in retaliation for their work as of Dec. 14, while at least 53 were killed overall. That compares to 18 retaliation killings among the 47 deaths documented by the committee in 2017. The report issued Wednesday includes the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, a native of Saudi Arabia fiercely critical of its royal regime. His Oct. 2 death inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul has led to tremors on the global political scene around allegations that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was involved. Khashoggi lived in self-imposed exile in the United States, and had gone to the Saudi consulate to formalize his divorce, but was instead strangled and dismembered — allegedly by Saudi agents. Asked whether he believed the crown prince had ordered Khashoggi's murder, President Donald Trump said last month, ""Maybe he did and maybe he didn't."" While the president condemned the violence against journalists, the committee noted that he has called them ""enemies of the people."" In addition to retaliation killings, journalists have died in combat or crossfire, or on other dangerous assignments. The deadliest country for journalists this year has been Afghanistan, where 13 journalists were killed, some in back-to-back blasts staged by suicide bombers and claimed by the militant group Islamic State, according to the report. Media freedom group Reporters Without Borders said Tuesday that the U.S. made it into the top five deadliest countries for journalists this year for the first time, with six dying, including four who were among five people killed by a gunman who opened fire in the offices of Maryland newspaper Capital Gazette on June 28. The shooting was the deadliest single attack on the media in recent U.S. history. A sales associate was also killed. The man had threatened the newspaper after losing a defamation lawsuit. Another two died while covering extreme weather. In addition, the committee said the imprisonment of journalists has been on the rise. ""The context for the crisis is varied and complex, and closely tied to changes in technology that have allowed more people to practice journalism even as it has made journalists expendable to the political and criminal groups who once needed the news media to spread their message,"" the committee said in its report. Time magazine last week recognized jailed and killed journalists as its ""person of the year,"" including Khashoggi, Maria Ressa imprisoned in the Philippines, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo imprisoned in Myanmar, and staff at the Capital Gazette. Journalists also have died this year in Slovakia, where 27-year-old investigative reporter Jan Kuciak was fatally shot while probing alleged corruption. Last year in Malta, Daphne Caruana Galizia, on a similar mission, was killed by a bomb placed in her car. At least four journalists were murdered in Mexico, two in Brazil, and two Palestinian journalists were shot and killed by Israeli soldiers during protests in the Gaza Strip, according to the report. In Syria and Yemen, two of the worst civil-war decimated countries, the fewest journalists were killed since 2011. Three died in Yemen, and in Syria, the committee recorded nine deaths compared to a high of 31 in 2012. However, the drop may be due to limited access or extreme risks that discourage media visits, the committee said. This story corrects that Maltese journalist Galizia was killed in 2017."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Girl, 8, dies after crawling under freight train at mother's direction, police say"	"A California mother accused of forcing her 8-year-old daughter to crawl under an idling freight train -- that ultimately killed the child -- so the family could catch a bus on the other side of the tracks has been arrested, authorities said. Fresno police took Joy Frances Collins, 44, into custody Monday on suspicion of child neglect likely to cause great bodily injury or death, police Chief Jerry Dyer said in a news conference. The girl, Joyanna Harris, died just after crawling under the Burlington Northern Santa Fe freight car after her mother told the girl and her 9-year-old brother to crawl under so the family wouldn’t miss a bus to take them home, Dyer said. “A mother placed her daughter in a position where she could be seriously injured or killed, and that’s what we have to look at,” he said. “We have a responsibility to hold that person accountable.” The family was near the tracks just before 6 p.m. when the one-mile long train stopped for about 12 seconds and blocked their path to a nearby bus stop. Collins told the kids to rush under, authorities said. The boy crawled underneath a railcar successfully, while Joy Anna was reluctant, Dyer said Tuesday. “Upon being encouraged by the mother to cross the track, she too made her way underneath the rail car and attempted to get to the other side,” Dyer said. As the girl attempted to cross, the train lurched forward and she became trapped. Collins chased after her and pulled her from the train after she was pulled 500 feet, police said. She died at the scene from her injuries. Police said Collins had directed her kids to endanger themselves in similar fashion before. James Whitehead lives just feet from the tracks and saw Harris being pulled by the train, the Fresno Bee reported. He climbed over a six-foot fence that separates his yard from the tracks and gave chase. ""Where’s the kid? Where’s the kid?” he said to himself, according to the paper. “We’ve seen five or six people die on the tracks here, but never a kid.” Dyer said that while police arrested Collins, he understands that she too is suffering from the loss of her daughter. ""We know that she is hurting,"" he said. ""I hope people understand that there is a balance that we have to achieve in law enforcement. No one last night wanted to arrest the mother for this crime but the law is the law."""	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Suspect in library supervisor's shooting death has history of library clashes, authorities say"	"Amber Clark and Ronald Seay both came to Northern California from other parts of the country. But when their lives crossed paths this year, there were tragic results, according to authorities. Clark, 41, a library supervisor who relocated from Oklahoma, was fatally shot last week outside the Sacramento library where she worked. Seay, 56, who came West from the St. Louis area, has been charged with murder in connection with Clark's death. Before arriving in California, Seay had a history of making threats toward librarians and was arrested several times for disturbances in St. Louis-area libraries and had been barred from at least two of them, Missouri officials told the Sacramento Bee. There was also a warrant out for his arrest, the officials said. Scott Bonner, director of a St. Louis-area library, said Seay threatened him repeatedly after a confrontation at the Ferguson Public Library on Aug. 23. LIBRARY SUPERVISOR, 41, GUNNED DOWN IN PARKING LOT MONTHS AFTER ALTERCATION WITH SUSPECT, POLICE SAY “He was here in the library and couldn’t find his wallet. He decided that staff had stolen it,” Bonner told the Bee, adding that Seay demanded that employees turn over the wallet. After Seay left the library, he called throughout the day with threats aimed at Bonner, the Bee reported. “He was clearly showing a pattern,” Brentwood, Mo., police Chief Joseph Speiss told the paper, confirming that Seay was involved in a disturbance in that town's public library. “He was loud in the library and had cursed, things like that, and had a confrontation with the women who were working,” Spiess told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. On Oct. 13, after he had arrived in Sacramento, Seay was involved in a disturbance at the city's North Natomas Public Library, where Clark worked, and was issued a no-trespass order, FOX 40 Sacramento reported. Then last week, Seay allegedly shot Clark multiple times in the head as she sat in her car in the library's parking lot. Sacramento police spokesman Sgt. Vance Chandler said detectives believe Seay specifically targeted Clark and were investigating the motive for the fatal shooting, the Sacramento Bee previously reported. Clark was an educator and worked at the Northwest Library in Oklahoma City for three years before the move to California, Oklahoma City's KWTV-DT reported. She joined the Sacramento Public Library in 2015, and worked in the Florin, North Highlands and Natomas branches, according to the Mercury News of San Jose. Julia McConnell, one many friends Clark made in Oklahoma City, told KWTV that she was still in shock over Clark's death. ""Amber was a tough cookie. She wasn't a victim. So it doesn't even seem likely that someone like Amber, that something like this could happen to her."" McConnell said, ""You know she didn't let anybody push her around and could really stand up and speak up for herself. So she wasn't a pushover."" McConnell told the station that she will remember the good memories she shared with Clark. ""Just how much fun we had sitting at the reference desk, laughing. We always would joke about the musical, the library musical that we are going to put on,"" she said. ""So I really hope to remember who she was in life and not the way that she died."" McConnell said although Clark was a ""pretty private person ... once you get to know her you just find out what an amazing person she is."" In a statement on Facebook, the Sacramento Public Library said Clark ""has been a champion for accessibility and inclusion, teaching all of us that we are all people and not defined by our disabilities or differences."""	nonTerrorism	Crime
 Arizona man gets prison term for threats against President Trump	"An Arizona man was sentenced Monday to 37 months in federal prison for threatening to fatally shoot President Trump earlier this year, prosecutors said. Jerrod Hunter Schmidt, 39, of Kingman, called Nebraska prosecutors in April and left threatening voicemails, saying he was going to “put a bullet” in Trump’s head and kill three Nebraska officials, including Gov. Pete Ricketts, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Arizona said. Federal court documents cited by the Arizona Republic indicate that officials identified Schmidt and alerted law enforcement agencies. Schmidt was found guilty in September of two counts of threatening the president of the United States and two counts of making interstate threatening communications, Tucson's KOLD-TV reported. After serving his prison sentence, Schmidt will be on three years of supervised release,  officials said. Schmidt reportedly served nine years in prison for child molestation in Nebraska, according to a federal complaint. Schmidt filed motions in Nebraska’s appeals court claiming he was owed money for wrongful imprisonment, the Republic reported. His conviction was upheld."	nonTerrorism	Crime

Air base worker charged with making threats; many guns found	"Police have seized more than 70 firearms from the home of a man who is accused of threatening to shoot co-workers at Selfridge Air National Guard Base in suburban Detroit. Master Sgt. Roque Diegel (DEE'-gul) is charged with making a false report or threat of terrorism. He denied the allegation during a court appearance Tuesday, calling it ""baffling.""

The car initially bypassed security personnel who check identification at the base entrance before striking ""in-place force protection barriers"" about 3 p.m., the spokeswoman said. A man and a woman in the vehicle were taken to an area hospital for evaluation of possible injuries. It was not immediately known why the driver tried to gain access to the base. Base officials said in a release that there is no indication the incident is related to Diegel's threat to the base. The gate-crashing was being investigated by the state police.

CASH SPILL ON NEW JERSEY HIGHWAY LEADS TO MULTIPLE CRASHES, CHAOS DURING MORNING COMMUTE “As a result, it was eventually determined that a plastic bag containing $140,000.00 in cash and another plastic bag containing $370,000.00 in cash, had fallen through the open door onto the roadway, causing the bags to become opened,” police said. “The vehicle traffic along with the windy weather conditions caused the currency to become airborne and scattered along the highway.” In videos posted to social media, motorists can be seen leaving their cars as they scramble to grab the cash from travel lanes. Brinks workers and motorists managed to recover $205,375, police said. Since then, an additional $115,670 has been turned in. Police reiterated their plea for anyone with cash related to Thursday’s incident to reach out to authorities. $188,955 was still unaccounted for, they said. Police put out a word of caution that individuals could face theft charges if the money isn’t returned, NJ.com reported. While there have yet to be any arrests, authorities are utilizing cell phone footage of the spill in an effort to track people down, Taormina told the outlet. “It depends on who our detectives are able to identify in those videos,” he said."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Chicago drug trafficker testifies against El Chapo at trial	"Identical twin brothers from Chicago made a fortune by distributing nearly 40 tons (36 metric tons) of cocaine worth $800 million for Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman before signing up as cooperators who spied on the cartel, one of the them testified Tuesday at a U.S. trial. Pedro Flores told the jury that the brothers had face-to-face meetings with Guzman and another Sinaloa cartel leader, Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, in Mexico in 2005 to begin negotiations for the cartel to use the pair's successful drug-dealing network covering Chicago, New York, Detroit and other large cities. ""You guys have my respect,"" he quoted Zambada as saying. ""Imagine if you guys were triplets."" When Flores wore shorts to his first sit-down with Guzman — or ""The Man,"" as he referred to him — at a mountainside hideout, the kingpin joked about why ""with all that money, I couldn't afford the rest of the pants,"" he said. Flores, 37, is the first American in a parade of cooperators testifying against Guzman at his drug-trafficking trial in federal court in Brooklyn. Defense lawyers have labeled the witnesses as shady criminals willing to say anything to get breaks in their own cases. In his first day on the witness stand Tuesday, Flores said he got his start as a young boy working as a translator in his father's drug-dealing operation. He and his brother, Margarito, eventually took over and grew it into a multimillion-dollar enterprise that came with occupational hazards, he said. After learning they would be charged in the U.S., the brothers relocated to Mexico in 2004 and kept dealing from afar as fugitives, Flores said. He described having a falling out with a Mexican drug dealer over a debt — a feud that resulted in him being kidnapped by captors who kept him blindfolded, handcuffed and unfed. After two weeks, he was released to his brother, apparently with the help of Guzman. His brother's first words to him, he said, were that he smelled bad and ""I met Chapo."" Flores said the dangers of the violent drug trade made him fear for his family, leading to a decision to contract Drug Enforcement Administration agents and begin cooperating by making secret recordings of Guzman and others, he said. A bloody civil war within the cartel meant ""we were in a lose-lose situation,"" he said, ""because we had to choose a side."" Flores, who eventually pleaded guilty and is serving a 14-year prison term, is to resume testifying Wednesday."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Sex assault case dropped, judge cites drunken prosecutor"	" An Iowa judge cited the courthouse arrest of a drunken prosecutor in dismissing charges against a man accused of sexually assaulting a 13-year-old boy. Judge Marti Mertz issued the ruling Monday and chastised Clarke County Attorney Michelle Rivera. The prosecutor's unavailability at a recent hearing in the case ""was the finale following unexplained periods of inactivity and lack of responsiveness"" since the man's arrest more than a year ago, the judge said. A sheriff's deputy arrested Rivera for being drunk in an Osceola courtroom on Oct. 18, just moments before the man was scheduled to enter a new plea and be sentenced in the case. The man later sought a dismissal because he hadn't been tried within a year of his arraignment. He was initially charged with sex assault and telephone dissemination of obscene material to a minor. Investigators say he admitted engaging in sex act with a minor in August 2017. The state can't refile the same charges against the man, said Mark Pennington, a former Polk County prosecutor not involved in the case ""Everybody should be upset about it,"" Pennington said. ""That's why you have to hold elected officials, including county attorneys, to a high standard."" Drake University law professor Robert Rigg, a criminal law expert, said there are options if the state wants to pursue charges. Clarke County prosecutors could attempt to file different charges, such as lascivious acts against a child. Or they could allow federal prosecutors to file their separate charges to get around the double-jeopardy protections the man now has at the state level. ""He may end up winning the battle and losing the war,"" Rigg said. A spokesman for the Iowa Attorney General's office said no one at the county level has sought their help in the case. Rivera and her attorney didn't immediately return messages from The Associated Press on Tuesday seeking comment about the case. Attempts by the AP to reach the victim's parents and their attorney were unsuccessful. Rivera pleaded guilty in the courthouse intoxication incident and was fined $65. The man's attorney, Marshall Orsini, told television station KCCI that his client's release from jail was long overdue. ""If the defendant is not put on trial (and) is not tried within a year, you have the potential to have that case dismissed, and that's what happened here,"" Orsini said. Rivera lost her re-election bid in November. She was arrested again last week in Osceola on charges of operating a vehicle while intoxicated and child endangerment. According to court documents, an officer said Rivera was intoxicated when she dropped her daughter off at a day care. A hearing on the new charges is set for Thursday."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Sex offender Owen Labrie ordered to jail after Christmas	"A judge declined Tuesday to shorten the jail term for an elite prep school graduate convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old classmate in 2015, saying he needed to consider the victim's family, which wants him to serve the remaining 10 months of his sentence. Merrimack County Superior Court Judge Larry Smukler appeared unmoved by defense arguments that Owen Labrie, 23, of Tunbridge, Vermont had become more mature and had already been punished by being under a curfew and having to wear an electronic monitoring device. Prosecutors wanted Labrie to serve the remainder of his sentence. Instead, Smukler said, his decision to uphold the sentence took into account ""justice for the victim."" He accepted a defense request that Labrie begin serving the sentence the day after Christmas but rejected a request that he be allowed out for work release. ""Given the crimes and the circumstances, it is just not appropriate to amend the sentence,"" Smukler said. Labrie was acquitted in 2015 of raping a 15-year-old classmate as part of ""Senior Salute,"" a game of sexual conquest, at St. Paul's School. But a jury found him guilty of misdemeanor sexual assault charges and endangering the welfare of a child. He also was convicted of using a computer to lure an underage student for sex, requiring him to register as a sex offender. Labrie did not speak during the hearing, nor did he comment to reporters as he left the courthouse. Several of his relatives and friends also left without speaking to reporters, with one crying as she walked out. ""Disappointed. It's been a very long haul for him,"" Labrie's attorney, Jaye Rancourt, said. ""He was a very young man at the time he was convicted. We had hoped four years later would be a different outcome. Unfortunately, it wasn't."" In making her case for suspending the sentence, Rancourt detailed how Labrie had followed the rules since his conviction, other than the curfew violation that resulted in him serving two months in jail. She noted he has recently worked two jobs, partly to pay for the cost of the electronic monitoring, and presented the court with several letters from employers that spoke to his ""character and hard work."" Rancourt also talked about how Labrie has struggled to find work because of the case and how he and his family have been subjected to abuse, including piles of hate mail. She acknowledged Labrie ""had a great deal of remorse"" but insisted the school was also to blame for allowing ""a highly sexualized culture"" that ""fostered if not encouraged some of this behavior."" ""He recognizes that he was not respectful to women ... and that is very shameful for him,"" Rancourt said. ""This young man now has to live the rest of his life with the majority of people in the world thinking that is him ... when in fact it's not. He is actually a very caring, sensitive individual whose life has been unalterably changed by this case and the publicity that it has generated."" Last month, the state Supreme Court upheld Labrie's convictions on the computer charge. The court dismissed arguments by Labrie's lawyers that prosecutors had failed to prove intent in his use of the computer and that the law was meant to be used to target internet predators and pedophiles, not cases like this. The court is also considering a separate appeal in which Labrie's lawyers argue he deserves a new trial over ineffective counsel. His lawyer argued his original counsel in the 2015 case failed to mount a defense against the computer charge or effectively communicate that Labrie had no intention of having sex with Chessy Prout when he sent her the messages. The lead trial lawyer, J.W. Carney Jr., is a well-known defense attorney whose clients included the late Boston gangster James ""Whitey"" Bulger. Two years ago, Prout spoke publicly about the assault for the first time. Prout, now 20, has since become an advocate for sexual assault survivors and co-wrote a memoir, ""I Have The Right To: A High School Survivor's Story of Sexual Assault, Justice, and Hope,"" with Boston Globe journalist Jenn Abelson."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Nevada officials say death row inmate trying to kill himself	"Prison officials say Nevada death row inmate Scott Dozier has gone to great lengths to kill himself while awaiting execution, including attempting to obtain drops of a deadly drug on a piece of paper sent through prison mail. They also intercepted mail from the convicted killer's sister with instructions on how to cut the jugular vein in his neck and that he turned over razor blades he somehow secured behind bars. The claims are in documents state lawyers filed last week in federal court in response to Dozier's lawyers' attempts to keep him out of an isolation cell where he was being held on suicide watch. He is waiting for what would be Nevada's first execution in more than 12 years. The execution was put on hold in September when a judge banned the use of expired drugs for a lethal injection. U.S. Magistrate Carla Baldwin Carry refused a defense motion earlier this month intended to ensure Dozier remains confined with other death row inmates, but is allowing his public defenders to file additional documents amending their claims. The legal battle includes Dozier's own statements that he wants to be put to death, his federal public defenders' argument that placing him in an isolation cell makes him more likely to attempt suicide and the state's insistence it must protect him from self-harm. Dozier's lawyers say he apparently cut his neck and wrist with a razor in October. They argue his deteriorating condition is the result of his unconstitutional treatment, including his denial of recreation time in the prison yard. They say he can't socialize with others, read, communicate with his family and effectively consult with legal counsel. They're seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent his return to isolation. Nevada Deputy Solicitor General Jordan Smith said in papers filed Friday Dozier's current legal counsel, federal public defenders and other anti-death penalty groups ""have thwarted the professional wishes of its own client by filing court actions that have prevented Dozier's execution."" ""Dozier has repeatedly informed (prison) officials ... he will take matters into his own hands and end his own life if the state is unable to carry out the execution in a timely manner,"" Smith wrote. Prison staff discovered a plot by Dozier Sept. 21 ""to obtain drugs in a highly concentrated form dropped onto a page of a letter through the mail,"" he said. Staff later confiscated a letter instructing him to write to another inmate with an example of images of hearts to be drawn around the droplets. The specific liquid drug wasn't known but fentanyl was a likely possibility because the synthetic opiate is not detectable by prison test kits, Smith said. In October, Dozier's sister attempted to provide him with a detailed anatomy textbook with information specifying the best way to ensure death by cutting the jugular or major neck arteries, Smith said. He said guards intercepted two pieces of mail from his sister with a hand-written diagram of the cardiovascular system. One said it ""takes about 2 minutes to bleed to death if the internal jugular is cut."" On Oct. 17, Dozier provided prison staff two razor blades and nail clippers in his possession, Smith said. ""Given that his family was attempting to help him learn how to cut his throat, it was objectively reasonable to restrict certain phone calls,"" Smith wrote. Those concerns ended Nov. 2 and Dozier was returned to death row. ""But any court ruling preventing the state from protecting Dozier's well-being, if needed, may have the effect of facilitating Dozier's suicide."" In a separate case, state Attorney General Adam Laxalt has until Dec. 26 to file his latest briefs in an appeal to the state Supreme Court of a judge's ruling in September that the state can't use its preferred mixture of three drugs to put Dozier to death because prison officials obtained drug manufacturer Alvogen's sedative midazolam through ""subterfuge,"" or deceit. The state's prison director, James Dzurenda, testified earlier that he disregarded letters from three drug manufacturers who did not want their medication used in an execution. Dozier has been on death row since 2007 for his murder convictions in the separate killings of drug trade associates in Phoenix and Las Vegas in 2002."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Missouri infant saved after father attempts to drown her in pond because of ‘bad thoughts,’ cops say"	"A Missouri infant was saved Monday after her father attempted to drown her in a pond because he was having “bad thoughts,” then left her in the frigid water as he walked to the police station to report the crime, cops said. Jonathon Zicarelli, 28, was charged with first-degree domestic assault after he attempted to kill his 6-month-old daughter by drowning her in a pond in Greenwood, FOX4KC reported. Zicarelli walked into Greenwood police station just after 10 a.m. Monday and told officers he drowned the child in a pond near a soccer field. Police Chief Greg Hallgrimson and Cpl. Tom Calhoun rushed to the pond and discovered the infant floating face up in the water. The child was barely moving and had mud in her eyes, grass and water in her mouth. Her body temperature was also nearly 11 degrees below normal, FOX4KC reported. The officers quickly jumped into the water to save the child, who had been in the water for more than 10 minutes by the time they arrived. Paramedics arrived and successfully revived the child, who was taken to the hospital and said to be in stable condition on Tuesday. Greenwood police Lt. Aaron Fordham told the Kansas City Star it was “a miracle” the child survived the incident. Fordham added that Zacarelli had “no emotion whatsoever” when he reported the attempted killing. “There was absolutely someone watching over that child today,” Fordham said. Zicarelli later told deputies he drove to the pond, parked the car and walked back and forth three times before deciding to leave his daughter in the icy water. He said he was having “bad thoughts” and wanted to make it easier on his wife by getting rid of the child, FOX4KC reported. He allegedly added he was stressed out while trying to provide for his family during the holidays."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Police: Officers save infant after dad said he drowned her	"Two Missouri officers saved the life of a 6-month-old girl whose father walked into their police station and said he had just drowned his daughter, authorities say. Greenwood police Chief Greg Hallgrimson and Cpl. Tom Calhoun rushed to a pond where the man said he had drowned his daughter Monday and pulled her out, performed CPR and warmed her up until she started breathing, said Lt. Aaron Fordham, who called the baby's survival a ""miracle."" He said the father, 28-year-old Jonathon Stephen Zicarelli, showed no emotion when he stunned officers with his report that he had left his daughter in an icy pond on the west side of Greenwood, which is about 20 miles (32 kilometers) southeast of Kansas City. While Fordham stayed with Zicarelli, Hallgrimson and Calhoun ran to the pond. They found the unconscious baby floating face up, lethargic and her skin a lifeless color, The Kansas City Star reported. She had mud in her eye and grass and water in her mouth, and her lungs were full of water. Officers estimate she had been in the pond more than 10 minutes. Calhoun waded into the thigh-deep water and rushed the girl to the bank. He cleared the water from her lungs and began CPR, and the infant began breathing within minutes, Fordham said. Calhoun and Hallgrimson removed the baby's wet clothes and wrapped her in the chief's shirt to warm her. Paramedics arrived and took the child to a nearby hospital. ""There was absolutely someone watching over that child today,"" he said. The hospital told police that the girl was stable and in good health as of Monday afternoon. She was being treated for hypothermia. ""The news came down through the chain and there was a huge sigh of relief,"" Fordham said. According to the charging documents, Zicarelli told investigators that he plotted for more than 24 hours to kill his daughter because he wanted to make things easier for his wife. He also said he was stressed by the holidays and trying to provide for his family. He said he walked down to the water three times before deciding to place the child in the water and watch her sink."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Woman, friend slashed on bus in New York City after trying to pet another woman's dog"	" Two women who tried to pet a dog on a New York City bus ended up getting slashed by the pooch's angry owner on Monday, police said. The incident happened shortly after 2 p.m. aboard the BX2 bus in the Melrose section of the Bronx, after a verbal dispute between the group turned into a physical fight. One of the victims, a 22-year-old woman, suffered cuts to her face and head, while the second woman, 20, received a cut to her left arm. ""I got sliced on my face because I went to go touch a dog,"" the 22-year-old woman, who did not give her name, told PIX11. ""I never knew the dog was a service animal."" Both victims exited the bus and ran to a hospital, where they sought medical care. Police said the suspect in the attack, who carried a black shoulder purse and a small white dog, also got off the bus and fled the scene in a green SUV taxi. The suspect, who is described as a woman between 30 to 35 years old, was last seen wearing a dark-colored baseball cap, a black waist-length coat, black pants and black and white sneakers. Anyone with information about the attack is urged to contact the NYPD's Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS(8477)."	nonTerrorism	Crime
El Chapo trial becomes New York's latest tourist attraction	"There was a time, after a spectacular prison escape, when Joaquin Guzman was the most wanted man in the world. The thrill of being able to see the man known as El Chapo up close — and live to tell the tale — has been drawing curious New Yorkers, fans of TV crime shows and even tourists to the Brooklyn courtroom where the infamous Mexican drug trafficker is being tried on charges that could put him in a U.S. prison for life. Some days, they are just two people among all the prosecutors, reporters, security officials and team of lawyers who fill up the courtroom. Other days you may see five. They sit up straight in the spectator area and look up so they can see Guzman's face. They also look with curiosity at his wife, Emma Coronel, who sits in the courtroom's public gallery nearly every day. ""It was surreal. It was like I was seeing the (Netflix) TV show 'El Chapo,'"" said spectator Peter Stolt, 23, who attended three days of the trial in November and hopes to show up for at least one more. Stolt, who recently graduated from Muhlenberg College in Pennsylvania and is interviewing for jobs in New York, said he has stood in line outside the building at around 6:30 am to make sure he gets a seat. What impressed him most, he said, was when Miguel Angel Martinez, a former assistant to Guzman who is now a prosecution witness, testified in dramatic detail how he survived several attempts on his life that he claimed were ordered by Guzman, one after an ominous serenade by a Mexican brass band. ""The grenade, the song. ... It's crazy. That was scary. It's crazy that we are hearing this firsthand,"" he said. The diminutive Guzman, whose nickname means ""Shorty"" in Spanish, was extradited to the United States last year to face charges accusing him of running the Sinaloa cartel, which smuggled tons of cocaine into the U.S. The six weeks of testimony from law enforcement officials, an imprisoned cocaine kingpin from Colombia and flashy Mexican drug smugglers have contained enough material to fill several seasons of ""Miami Vice"" or ""Narcos."" There has been testimony about secret smuggling tunnels built beneath the border, assassination attempts, bribery of high level police officials, private jets filled with millions of dollars in cash, and factories churning out cocaine-filled cans disguised as hot pepper containers. Guzman's lawyers say the lowlife cooperators are lying in an attempt to frame him and get an easier sentence in their own drug-trafficking cases. Joaquin Martinez, a 55-year-old Mexican who has lived in New York for more than a decade, said seeing El Chapo in person was worth the trip from Manhattan to Brooklyn. However, he expected him with a moustache, like in many of the photos people have seen of him over the years. ""It took me a couple of seconds to realize it was him. To be honest, he looked like ... a regular person,"" he said. He was more impressed by Coronel, Guzman's wife, who he thought walked around the courtroom confidently, as if she were in her own home. She sat in a bench in front of him. ""I could smell her perfume,"" said Martinez, who owns and manages several restaurants in New York. Hearing phone recordings of drug dealings in the courtroom impressed him, he said, but also when prosecutors showed as evidence a photograph of Amado Carrillo, a Mexican drug lord who is famous in his home country and who died in 1997 in a plastic surgery operation to change his face. Spectators go through security in the lobby of the building and need to remove their shoes to go through a second metal detector and X-ray bag scanner on the eighth floor. Then they sign up on a sheet. Wayne Burg, a 49-year-old Australian criminal lawyer, went to see the trial with his 21-year-old daughter, Lydia, during their December vacation in New York. Going to federal court to see El Chapo was a must-do before a Knicks game. ""The amount of drugs, the amount of money ... these are extraordinary levels,"" said Burg, who ended up with his daughter in the overflow room, watching on a video feed, because there was no space in the courtroom. ""We had a great holiday, but the case was one of the highlights!"" he said. Not all days are exciting. Some members of the jury have dozed off when technical aspects of law enforcement drug searches have been explained. Guzman, however, always seems to pay attention, looking at witnesses when they speak and whispering to his lawyers' ears. For those interested in going, there is still time. The trial may last for two more months."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Waffle House shooting suspect sent delusional text messages	"The man accused of killing four people in a Nashville Waffle House used to send his father text messages in which he punctuated everyday chitchat with delusional rants. Police say 29-year-old Travis Reinking was nearly naked, only wearing a green jacket, when he opened fire outside the restaurant on April 22 and then stormed inside. Police have said there would have been far more casualties if it weren't for a quick-thinking restaurant patron who wrestled the AR-15 rifle away from the gunman. By the time of the shooting, Reinking's erratic behavior had already come to the attention of law enforcement, including the Tazewell County Sheriff's Office in Illinois, where he lived part-time. According to several incident reports, Reinking believed the singer Taylor Swift was stalking and harassing him, including hacking into his computer and phone. He believed the police and his family were part of the conspiracy, and his delusions went back to at least August 2014. The texts between father and son that were filed as evidence in federal court this week begin in April 2017, just a year before the shooting, as Reinking discussed making money by selling a patent. Friendly back-and-forth texts about work and dinner continued until May 21, 2017, when Reinking told his father he was going to start keeping his phone off most of the time and would go to the library when he wanted to use the internet. ""These people are still listening and reading stuff on my phone over the internet,"" he wrote. Then, ""I don't want to be told gay things inadvertently when I'm trying to learn about something else, and they have been saying stupid stuff like I'm a transsexual, and things like that."" A few minutes later he wrote that he was ""thinking about going to the ball diamonds to practice later. U want to come."" On May 23, 2017, Reinking wrote, ""These people told me that you guys signed a non disclosure agreement, to hide it from me. If your helping them, please stop no matter what it cost you. I don't think you fully realize what these people have been doing to me. ... These people tried to kill me."" A few weeks later, his father texted him about a job and he texted back, ""You're going to hell for what you are doing. Don't say nobody warned you. You are the same type of people who nailed Jesus to the cross. They acted out of fear because of what they didn't understand."" But the next day he sent a text that read, ""Their is a red jeep Cherokee for sale at the corner of Baer and 9 right now for 6k. Looks newer and nice."" On June 23, 2017, Reinking texted that he was moving out of state for work, ""So you don't have to worry about me ever again."" In July 2017, Reinking was arrested by the U.S. Secret Service at the White House, where officials say he was seeking an audience with President Trump, but he was soon released. No texts refer to the arrest. On July 31, 2017, Reinking apologized to his father for ""venting,"" writing, ""I feel terrible if I'm accusing you of something your not involved in. I don't know what to believe anymore."" But the following day he sent a long, profanity-laced rant calling his father a ""psychopath"" and writing, ""You are actively assaulting me, with organized crime, and then being dishonest about doing it."" A week later, he sent a text about insurance for a truck. On Nov. 12, 2017, Reinking sent the message, ""Dad, I got a place out of town now, I'm going to need to get my firearms back from you somehow."" Jeffrey Reinking had stored his son's rifles and handgun in his gun safe after state police revoked Travis Reinking's Illinois firearms owner identification. The official reason for the revocation was that he was a non-resident, although officials have said the action came at the request of federal agents after the White House arrest. At least three separate lawsuits by family members of the victims fault Jeffrey Reinking for negligence because he returned the guns to his son. Jeffrey Reinking's attorney said in a deposition filed on Monday that a criminal investigation of the matter is ongoing. But the document also says Reinking did not believe he had the authority to keep his son's guns once Travis Reinking demanded them back. The last texts between father and son came on Nov. 19, 2017, when Jeffrey Reinking invited his son to come over for breakfast after church. After that, Travis Reinking left town and his father did not know for certain where he was until he heard about the April shooting, Jeffrey Reinking said in the deposition. After the attack, Travis Reinking was ordered to receive treatment in a mental facility for schizophrenia. By October, prosecutors said mental health officials had concluded Reinking was competent to face charges in court. Jeffrey Reinking sent several texts that went unanswered between the time his son left town and the shooting, including one on Jan. 10, 2018, that reads, ""Mom and I are wondering if everything is ok. We haven't heard from you. And we are getting concerned."""	nonTerrorism	Crime
Retired Marine tackles gun-wielding bar patron in Pennsylvania	"A retired Marine Corps combat veteran helped thwart a robbery in Pennsylvania on Tuesday after he tackled a person pointing a gun at him, police said. The Altoona Police Department said the incident happened around 1 a.m. at Ajay's Bar, when a hooded man or woman walked in and demanded cash. The bartender, who was not identified, can be seen on surveillance videos released by the department taking money out of the cash register as the gun-wielding bar patron stands near him. The bartender starts to hand cash over then suddenly tackles the person. During the struggle, police said a shot was fired, but neither of the two was struck by the bullet. The would-be robber then fled the bar, leaving a blood trail to the backyard of a home down the road before eventually getting away.

"The Girl In The Closet' arrested in sexual assault of 14-year-old girl, police say"	"A Texas woman who was known as “The Girl in the Closet” after suffering years of torture and abuse by her family has been arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting an underage teen girl, police said. Lewisville police said Wednesday they received a tip earlier the week from the teen claiming she had been sexually assaulted by Lauren Kavanaugh, according to the Dallas Morning-News. Police said the teen, 14, told them she had been in a sexual relationship with the woman for two months. The two met through a Facebook page titled “The Lauren Kavanaugh Story,” according to detectives. The page was used to offer support to abuse victims, police said. Kavanaugh admitted to the sexual relationship with the girl and was arrested, the newspaper reported. Police believe there may have been more victims and have asked parents to speak with their children to find out whether they had inappropriate contact with Kavanaugh. She was charged with sexual assault of a child and was being held in Denton County Jail on $10,000 bail.

The officers had run onto an elevated area of the tracks on the city's far South Side to investigate the gunfire. A northbound Metra train had approached ahead of them, but it was the South Shore Line train that they hadn't noticed, the Chicago Tribune reported. When South Chicago District officers saw Brown walk down a set of stairs from the Metra train station, they stopped him and asked him if he was carrying anything illegal, to which he said, “Yes, I have a gun on me,” Chicago Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said, according to the Tribune. Police then found a .38-caliber Kel-Tec semiautomatic handgun on Brown's sweater pocket. The suspect admitted to shooting the gun on the tracks, the local papers reported, citing officials. At least four shell casings were also recovered, Fox 32 Chicago reported. Shotspotter technology had detected the sound of gunfire and alerted police about shots fired in the area. The police officers were focused on the other train coming from the opposite direction, officials said. ""They must have thought the sound they heard was the northbound train,"" he said. ""They must have missed the sound of the train right behind them."" CHICAGO OFFICERS LIKELY DIDN'T SEE TRAIN THAT KILLED THEM Between the sound of the first train and focus on their investigation, they were unable to move off the tracks. ""These brave young men were consumed with identifying a potential threat,"" Superintendent Eddie Johnson explained to reporters at a news conference late Monday night. Guglielmi said ""very limited"" video from a body camera one of the officers was wearing helped investigators piece together how the tragedy might have happened. On the video, they ""clearly acknowledge"" a northbound train just before the southbound train hit them, Guglielmi said. The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Crime
City to pay $480G in medical costs for suspect injured after allegedly shooting police officer: reports	"Taxpayers in Omaha, Neb., will pay nearly $480,000 in medical bills for a suspect whom police wounded with gunfire after he allegedly shot an officer on Sept. 11, city council members decided this week in a 6-1 vote. The officers struck suspect John Ezell Jr., 36, multiple times after he fired at Omaha Police Gang Unit Officer Ken Fortune, 42, striking the officer in a shoulder, during a traffic stop in the city, authorities said, according to Omaha's FOX 42. The officer recovered quickly and was soon released from a hospital, but the suspect spent about a month recuperating, racking up medical bills totaling $479,341.25, the Omaha World-Herald reported. The city initially agreed to pay half the cost, with Ezell responsible for the remaining $239,670.63. But Tuesday's vote means the city will pick up the suspect's share as well, the newspaper reported. “I’m sure there’s going to be a number of council members who will hold their nose and vote for it,” City Council President Ben Gray told the paper prior to the vote. “I’m going to be one of them. We’re obligated to do it.” The city is constitutionally required to provide medical treatment to those who need it while in police custody, Assistant City Attorney Jeff Bloom told the World-Herald. Ezell had no health insurance, and was not covered by Medicaid or Medicare, the report said. The fact that Ezell was injured by police makes the city liable to cover the costs, Bloom said. Some city council members were still displeased despite approving Ezell's medical bill. ""I think this is unfathomable that we are doing this,"" council member Brinker Harding told Omaha's KETV-TV. ""I understand we have to do it, but I think this is something we should think of when we're talking with our state senators and working something through the unicameral so situations like this are not at the expense of our taxpayers."" Council member Vinny Palmero, however, cast the lone vote against paying Ezell's medical bill. ""If police are acting within good faith and not in a reckless manner, as this particular case was, then we as a city should not be liable,"" Palmero told the station. Ezell, a reputed gang member, has pleaded not guilty to attempted murder, assault on an officer and other charges, according to court records. He was being held on $3 million bail, the World-Herald reported. Fortune has been with the Omaha Police Department for nearly 11 years, Omaha's WOWT-TV reported. Council member Chris Jerram asked the city attorney if a civil action could be pursued against Ezell to recover some of the money, KETV reported. The city attorney's office assured Jerram that such an attempt would be made. Police told the World-Herald that Ezell was drunk when he fired at Fortune during a traffic stop. They said Ezell was a passenger in a vehicle being pursued by police. The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Crime
My baby's been shot!' Chaotic scene at shooting of infant	"The screams of a teen caught the attention of Casey Franchot while eating at a Taco Bell. ""My baby's been shot! My baby's been shot!"" Shayanne Nelson yelled while holding an infant in a blood-soaked blanket. The 43-year-old former U.S. Army medic dropped his food and dashed across the busy the historic Route 66 highway in Gallup, New Mexico to a motel to investigate. He found what police described as a chaotic scene involving a distraught mother, a baby with a gunshot wound to the face, a confused 3-year-old boy and boyfriend trying to wipe away evidence. The scene also, a family member says, was the latest in a series of tragic episodes linked to a controlling boyfriend and a poor, Navajo teenage mom who hasn't fully recovered from the death of her fiance. Gallup police say detectives are still trying to connect the moments leading to a when a bullet from a .32 caliber revolver struck the face of an 8-month-old girl near her left ear and her left eye. The bullet, one officer said, left the infant deaf in one ear and may leave her blind in one eye. According to a police report, officers arrived at the Dec. 8 scene to find Franchot working to stop the baby from choking on her own blood. A 3-year-old boy stood on the passenger seat wearing only a diaper despite freezing temperatures outside. A frantic Nelson kept punching her car and crying. But who fired the gun remains a mystery. Nelson, 18, told police minutes after the shooting that she and her boyfriend, Tyrell Bitsilly, were in a shower at the Zia Motel when they heard a gunshot. She ran out to discover her daughter on the bed and bleeding from the face, she told police. Nelson said she believed her 3-year-old found a gun left by a prior occupant and accidentally shot his infant sister. But Franchot said as he worked to save the baby's life in the motel room, he saw Bitsilly, 21, wiping the gun with a towel. ""I was also prepared to grab the baby and roll on the room for cover in case he started shooting,"" Franchot said. Franchot then jumped in a police vehicle to rush the baby to Gallup Indian Medical Center. On the way, the officer warned Franchot every time they approached a bump, Franchot said. Gallup Police Officer Darius Johnson told The Associated Press in an interview Wednesday that the 8-month-old girl now was being treated at an Albuquerque hospital and is in an induced coma. At the scene, Nelson and Bitsilly were arrested and charged with child abuse. Police also charged Bitsilly with tampering with evidence. However, court records show the December shooting wasn't the first time police linked Bitsilly to a shooting involving Nelson and her two children. In October, Gallup police arrested Bitsilly after authorities say he fired a weapon inside a car with Nelson, her mother and the two young kids. Bitsilly was charged with aggravated assault with deadly weapon, child abuse, shooting from a motor vehicle and tampering with evidence, court records said. ""Shayanne was trying to break up with him,"" Shanna Nelson, 39, the sister of Shayanne, said in an interview. ""He got mad and shot at the (car's) floorboard."" After the October shooting, Shayanne promised to get a restraining order against Bitsilly, her sister said. The pair had been dating off and on since Shayanne's fiance — and the father of her two children — was killed in a car accident last year, Shanna Nelson said. He was often emotionally and physically abusive, she said. But the emotionally depleted Nelson, who regularly found herself with no place to stay, returned to Bitsilly for comfort and out of fear, according to her sister. During a court appearance Wednesday, Shayanne walked into court and waved to her sister and her niece. When McKinley County Magistrate Judge Robert Baca announced he was keeping her bond at $20,000, she threw her head back. ""She doesn't have $2,000 to get out,"" her sister said. ""None of us do."" The 18-year-old stood motionless as lawyers agreed to postpone the preliminary hearing until Jan. 9 thanks to new video evidence. As police escorted Shayanne Nelson out, her tearful sister yelled, ""We love you, Shayanne!"""	nonTerrorism	Crime
APNewsBreak: 4 faced scrutiny before arrest in Tibbetts case	"Before investigators arrested a farmhand in the death of Iowa runner Mollie Tibbetts, they scrutinized a neighbor seen washing his car hours after she vanished, an acquaintance who erased his cellphone data, a Nebraska man who ditched his vehicle nearby and a farmer with a history of stalking women. Newly unsealed search warrants reviewed by The Associated Press reveal that four men were the subject of police interest at times during the five-week search for the missing 20-year-old University of Iowa student. The documents provide new details about how Tibbetts' July 18 disappearance in the town of Brooklyn, Iowa, stumped agents as the mystery became the focus of national media coverage and one of the largest investigations in state history. The suspect ultimately charged in Tibbetts' death, Cristhian Bahena-Rivera, did not come on their radar until shortly before he allegedly led them to her body in a cornfield in August. Investigators say Rivera, 24, followed Tibbetts in a car and then on foot as she was out for an evening run, kidnapped her after a struggle and stabbed her to death. Rivera was identified as a suspect after officers found surveillance footage showing a Chevy Malibu that they later linked to him. Rivera, who is scheduled to stand trial, is a Mexican national who was allegedly in the U.S. illegally . Before then, investigators had focused attention on four others in the suspected kidnapping based on circumstances and seemingly suspicious behavior. They faced police interviews, searches of their vehicles and property and scrutiny of their cellphone data before agents determined they had nothing to do with Tibbetts' disappearance. ""It was not a fun thing to go through, that's for sure,"" said Tim Tometich, 42, who lives along the running route where Tibbetts was last seen. ""But we all wanted her found and home safe and obviously understand they had a job to do and needed to track down every lead they had."" Tometich drew attention after agents obtained surveillance footage from a Brooklyn car wash showing him washing a dark-colored SUV at 10:30 p.m. on July 18, hours after Tibbetts vanished. But he told investigators that he wasn't at the car wash until three days later and that his credit card information would show that. A state agent seeking a warrant to obtain Tometich's phone data alleged that claim was ""untruthful"" based on video and business records. Tometich declined comment on that. All the men were later ruled out as suspects through further investigation, said Mitch Mortvedt, assistant director of the Division of Criminal Investigation. ""In any investigation we come across people who raise an eyebrow to us. They have absolutely nothing to do with the issue we're investigating, but their behavior draws your attention for a short amount of time,"" he said. ""There was a handful of those scattered throughout the five weeks."" Rivera's attorney, Chad Frese, said he's aware of the individuals described in the warrants but that it's premature to comment on defense strategy. Mortvedt said the farmer was of interest longer than others, in part because he gave multiple attention-grabbing media interviews in which he denied involvement but acknowledged his criminal history. He allowed agents to question him and search his home and property outside of Brooklyn, about 200 yards (182 meters) from where investigators determined that Tibbetts' cellphone dropped off the network. The investigation was driven by technology from the beginning. Tibbetts' phone records indicated that her rate of movement on a rural road near Brooklyn sped rapidly, as if she went from running to traveling in a car. Investigators then obtained a warrant requiring Google to provide data showing which users could be tracked to that vicinity. One of four such Google customers was a 17-year-old who was Facebook friends with Tibbetts. The teen's brother was on the same construction crew as Tibbetts' boyfriend, who was out of town when she vanished, so investigators assumed he may have known Tibbetts was home alone. The teen told agents he was at home July 18, but later said he may have been mowing a cemetery. He raised suspicion when he told agents that he had recently ""wiped"" his smartphone of all stored data and didn't have it on him. The focus of intense interest early on was a 58-year-old Stanton, Nebraska man, who arrived at a car dealership 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Brooklyn on July 20. The man told a salesman that he was driving to visit a foreign girlfriend while she was in Indiana but that his 1989 Chevy Grand Marquis was having transmission trouble, according to search warrant materials. He bought a used car for $3,500 and left the Chevy there, taking its license plates and a small bag with him. He said he would be back for the Chevy — which a witness said resembled a suspicious vehicle she saw near Tibbetts' home on July 18 — but didn't leave contact information. Agents searched the vehicle after seeing a reddish spot in the backseat. They found hairs, including dark ones that they thought could have belonged to Tibbetts, and sent them to the crime lab for examination. They obtained warrants for information from the man's two Facebook accounts, one of which liked the pages of dozens of scantily clad female athletes and models. But Mortvedt said nothing in the car tied him to Tibbetts, and the man was ruled out as a suspect. ""Once we started to dive into a few of them, everybody as a team felt confident that we were safely eliminating them,"" he said."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Newt Gingrich: First Step Act vote shows Trump, Democrats and Republicans can work together"	"Senate passage of the First Step Act criminal justice reform bill on Tuesday was an important milestone to show the American people that the Trump White House, Republicans and Democrats can work together for the good of the country. The bill sailed to passage with an overwhelmingly bipartisan 87-12 vote in the Senate. This could never have happened without the constant, steady leadership of Jared Kushner and his team in the White House; Republicans in the House and Senate; and the army of groups advocating for criminal justice reform. These groups included Right on Crime, FreedomWorks, the American Conservative Union, #cut50 and many others. To be sure, this bill does not solve all of the problems in our federal prison system – there is still plenty of work to do – but it will bring about some important improvements that can lead to even more reforms, lower prison costs and safer communities. First, this bill will create a system by which federal inmates will be assessed for their risks and needs – both when they get to prison and throughout their sentences. These assessments will focus on determining the risk level that each inmate will recidivate – or commit more crimes upon his or her release. The assessments will also ascertain behavioral, health, educational and other needs of inmates to address other potential problems. This could drastically reduce the national recidivism rate by helping more prisoners to actually rehabilitate while they are incarcerated. Under the bill, the Second Chance Act will also be reauthorized. This law provides grants for programs for drug treatment, vocational treatment, mentoring and other re-entry and recidivism reduction initiatives. Further, these changes will help the federal Bureau of Prisons learn what programing works best for inmates on a system-wide basis. Inmates who qualify will be incentivized to complete these programs through a number of opportunities, most notably through earned-time credits. These credits will allow low- and minimum-risk inmates (who have not committed a disqualifying crime) to finish the remainder of their sentences in halfway houses, home confinement or supervised release. The Bureau of Prisons and the Government Accountability Office will regularly track this system to ensure it is operating as the law intended. Another aspect of this bill will fix well-intended but damaging decisions of the past. The so-called “three strikes” law will be changed so it applies only to serious drug felons and serious violent felons – rather than anyone charged with trafficking drugs. The mandatory minimum sentence enhancement for a “second strike” will be lowered from 20 years to 15 years, and the “third strike” will be reduced from a mandatory minimum of a life sentence to 25 years. Importantly, the bill will make the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 retroactive for those trapped by disproportionately high sentences related to crack cocaine. These much-needed reforms have been debated and considered for more than a decade. They are now very close to becoming reality. When the First Step Act clears the House as expected and President Trump signs it into law – as he has pledged to do – it will be a very important day for his administration and all Americans."	nonTerrorism	Crime

 Illinois AG finds 500 more Catholic clergy accused of abuse	"Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan on Wednesday issued a blistering report about clergy sexual abuse, saying that Catholic dioceses in Illinois has not released the names of at least 500 clergy accused of sexually abusing children. The preliminary report found that the church's six archdioceses have done a woefully inadequate job of investigating allegations and in some cases did not investigate them at all or notify the state's child welfare agency. Madigan's office said that while the dioceses have disclosed 45 more names of those credibly accused, the total number of names disclosed is only 185 and raises questions about the church's response to the crisis. ""By choosing not to thoroughly investigate allegations, the Catholic Church has failed in its moral obligation to provide survivors, parishioners and the public a complete and accurate accounting of all sexually inappropriate behavior involving priests in Illinois,"" Madigan said in a statement. ""The failure to investigate also means that the Catholic Church has never made an effort to determine whether the conduct of the accused priests was ignored or covered up by superiors."" The report does not include some key details such as when the allegations were made. It also does not accuse the dioceses of withholding the names of 'credibly"" accused clergy, only that the list of names of accused clergy is far longer than has been made public. A Madigan spokeswoman said that the allegations date back decades and include some priests who are now deceased. The Illinois disclosures are a new blow to the credibility of the church, which has struggled to contain the scandal amid mounting accusations of negligence. In August, a Pennsylvania grand jury report alleged that hundreds of priests abused at least 1,000 children over seven decades in that state. The report prompted Pope Francis to call U.S. bishops for a retreat at a suburban Chicago seminary next month to debate how to respond. Larry Antonsen, a Chicago leader of Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, said Madigan is doing the right thing and needs to continue. He said Illinois should convene a grand jury with subpoena power, as in Pennsylvania. ""There's more that needs to be done. The Catholic Church does not do a good job of policing itself, and you can't expect them to do that,"" Antonsen said. ""It's hard to know what to believe because so much of what they're doing is in secret and not out in the open, but this is a step in the right direction."" A leading attorney who has represented survivors of abuse called for the additional names of priests to be made public. ""The Illinois Bishops must release these names immediately so that survivors can heal and no other kids are harmed,"" said Minneapolis-based Jeff Anderson. Madigan's office said the problems went beyond a lack of effort. In some cases, the report found, efforts were made to work against the accusers. ""When the Illinois Dioceses investigated an allegation, they frequently found reasons not to deem an allegation 'credible' or 'substantiated,'"" according to the report. Not only did Madigan's office find a ""pattern"" of dioceses failing to substantiate allegations that came from one person, ""The dioceses also often found reasons to discredit survivors' stories of abuse by focusing on the survivors' personal lives."" Illinois church leaders expressed regret about the abuse, but pointed to steps they have taken to address what has become an international crisis. Chicago's archbishop, Cardinal Blase J. Cupich, in a statement said that although he regretted ""our failures to address the scourge of clerical sexual abuse,"" the archdiocese has been a leader in dealing with the issue, including a policy since 2002 of reporting ""all allegations of child sexual abuse to civil authorities."" The Springfield diocese said that it reviewed paper files of clergy dating to its 1923 founding and provided Madigan's office with documentation of each instance of abuse, regardless of whether it was deemed credible, according to a statement. The Diocese of Joliet said in a statement that it took steps such as establishing in 1993 a review committee made up of people from law enforcement, social service agencies and others to investigate allegations of sexual abuse. Madigan said her office's findings make it clear that notifying authorities is critical, and pointing to instances when dioceses used personal information about people to discredit them and help them conclude accusations weren't credible. ""The preliminary stages of this investigation have already demonstrated that the Catholic Church cannot police itself,"" she said."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Amigo!' Jury hears cheerful El Chapo on tape at US trial	"Secretly recorded phone calls played Wednesday at the U.S. trial of notorious Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman make him sound as if he was enjoying his life as a narco-outlaw. ""Amigo!"" a cheerful voice identified as Guzman's says at the start of a 2008 call made by an American drug distributor who has been on the witness stand this week. ""Here at your service,"" Guzman says, according a government translation of the conversation spoken in Spanish. ""You know that."" A jury heard the recordings at a federal trial in Brooklyn where Guzman is facing drug-trafficking charges accusing him of orchestrating a wave of violence to protect his wildly lucrative operation. Since being sent to the U.S. early last year after twice breaking out of Mexican prisons, his lawyers have said he is being framed by a cadre of shady cooperators. The latest cooperator to testify, Pedro Flores, called Guzman after he agreed to cooperate with Drug Enforcement Administration agents investigating the elusive boss of the Sinaloa cartel, who was hiding out in a mountainous region of Mexico. Flores, who was a fugitive in Mexico at the time, testified that he wanted to help his handlers by getting Guzman on tape discussing a large-scale heroin deal. ""I was working for the DEA, trying to set him up,"" Flores testified. After the pair exchange pleasantries on one call, Flores recorded himself asking as a favor whether Guzman could cut the per-kilo price they had originally agreed on by $5,000 to $50,000. Guzman sounds happy to help out. ""I'll pick up the money tomorrow,"" Guzman says with little hesitation. ""That price is fine."" Flores asks Guzman in a brief follow-up call on the same day if he could deliver another large shipment of heroin to replenish a Chicago-based distribution network that Flores and his identical twin brother, Margarito, still controlled from Mexico. Guzman questions why, since it was his understanding that the Flores twins had already received a shipment from another cartel supplier. ""Yes, but what they sent was not good,"" he responds. ""It doesn't compare to what you had."" In the end, Flores told the jury, a kingpin feared far and wide ""agreed to my terms.""

"Florida deputy kills wife, daughter, granddaughter, self"	" A Florida sheriff's deputy fatally shot his wife, granddaughter and daughter before he radioed dispatchers to say he'd hurt his family early Wednesday, then killed himself in front of fellow deputies near a high school, authorities said. The events unfolded before students had arrived for school in Plant City, a rural community east of Tampa. Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister identified the deputy as 58-year-old Terry Strawn, who in 2009 was named ""Officer of the Year."" ""There was no indication, no behavior issues,"" Chronister said. ""Nothing that would lead any employee to believe this employee was struggling."" Strawn went on the department's main radio channel just before 7 a.m. Wednesday to say he had harmed his family. The deputy mentioned financial and health problems and said he was going to kill himself near the local high school, the sheriff said. ""Throughout the entire dialogue on the radio, the dispatchers did a wonderful job of trying to convince him that suicide is not the answer,"" Chronister said. The sheriff said three other deputies quickly located Strawn and they made ""every attempt possible to try to convince this deputy sheriff that there was a different way, that there was a different solution."" ""Unfortunately, the deputy took his own life on scene in front of the other deputies,"" Chronister said. Strawn used his service revolver in each of the shootings. The deputy had ties to the sheriff's office dating to 1991, when he was hired as a jail deputy. He became a patrol officer a few years later. According to local media archives, he and another deputy shot and killed a man in the line of duty in 2004. The man pointed a metal and plastic tool at the officers as they tried to arrest him during a domestic violence call. Fearing the object was a gun, the deputies fired their weapons. Chronister said he was briefly suspended in 1998 for defacing sheriff's office property and was disciplined in 2016 for two traffic crashes. Retired from the office in 2017, he then returned to duty as a contracted school safety officer, a position that some schools in Florida created after the Stoneman Douglas High School massacre last February in South Florida. Chronister said the agency had recently told Strawn he would be hired full-time as a school officer. ""He had done a wonderful job. Phenomenal,"" the sheriff said. ""When we hired him back, he went through an extensive background and psychological testing."" Strawn took the life of his 54-year-old wife, his 32-year-old daughter and his 6-year-old granddaughter. He was a safety officer at an elementary school in another suburb of Tampa that his granddaughter attended. This is the second time a Hillsborough County Sheriff's deputy was involved in a murder-suicide in recent months. On Sept. 24, a deputy killed his wife and then himself while the couple's four children were at home."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Jesuits: No priests suspected of abuse will go to Gonzaga	"Jesuit leaders say no priest credibly accused of sexually abusing a minor will ever be sent to Gonzaga University after a report this week that at least 20 clergy members facing sexual abuse allegations were allowed to live out their lives at the campus in Washington state. The revelation comes amid a renewed national outcry over allegations of the sexual abuse of children by priests in the Catholic church. Jesuits are a Catholic order that includes more than 16,000 men worldwide who serve in churches, high schools, colleges and other institutions. Founded in the 1880s, Jesuits operate the Catholic university in Spokane, Washington. ""Jesuits West guarantees that no Jesuit with a credible allegation of sexual abuse of a minor is currently or will ever be knowingly assigned to Gonzaga University or the Jesuit community on its campus,"" the Jesuits West Province said in a statement Tuesday. Instead, Jesuits facing credible allegations will live at the province's senior health care facility in Los Gatos, California, the province said. The Center for Investigative Reporting reported Monday that the Jesuits had sent at least 20 priests facing sexual abuse allegations to Cardinal Bea House. The last known abusive priest was moved out of Cardinal Bea House on the Gonzaga campus in 2016, Jesuit records show. Gonzaga President Thayne McCulloh on Monday said he was disturbed by the story and demanded guarantees that no priests accused of abuse would be assigned to Gonzaga again. One priest, the Rev. James Poole, admitted under oath that he sexually abused indigenous women and girls in Alaska. In a deposition taken while he lived in Bea House, Poole said he regularly went to Gonzaga's library and basketball games. According to the news report, Poole's misconduct was first documented in 1960 and continued in Alaska until 1988, when he was removed from his position. The following year, he took a job as a chaplain at St. Joseph Medical Center in Tacoma. Poole worked at the hospital until 2003, when he retired to Cardinal Bea House. He died in March. McCulloh said he was disturbed by ""the revelation that the Society of Jesus had knowingly sent a man with Poole's record of sexual abuse to live in their facility within the parameters of our campus, which serves not only as the home of college students, but regularly hosts grade-school children and visitors of all ages, without notification by the province to the university."" ""I had relied upon the Province to inform us of any Jesuit whose history might pose a threat to our students or campus community,"" McCulloh said. Also Tuesday, the Jesuit province announced it will impose a new restriction on access to its document archives because they contain ""sensitive personnel records."" Any requests for records now will be vetted by a San Francisco attorney who has defended Catholic institutions from sexual abuse claims for at least two decades, the province said. On Monday, the Roman Catholic Jesuit province serving much of the eastern United States released the names of Jesuit priests who face ""credible or established"" accusations of sexual abuse of minors dating to 1950. In a letter, the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus identified five living Jesuits facing offenses that took place in the province and another eight who are dead."	nonTerrorism	Crime
"5 deaths in massive Texas apartment fire ruled homicide, no suspects named"	"A Texas apartment fire in July that left five people dead was intentionally set, and the deaths were officially ruled homicides, authorities said Tuesday. The victims, 21-year-old Belinda Moats, 19-year-old Haley Frizzell, 21-year-old David Ortiz, 20-year-old Dru Estes and 23-year-old James Miranda – died of thermal injuries, Hays County Justice of the Peace Maggie Moreno said. Inhalation of combustible products was also a cause of death for Moats, Estes and Miranda, she said. All of the victims were on the second floor of Building 500 at the Iconic Village Apartments in San Marcos on July 20 when the fire erupted, according to the San Antonio Express-News. Ortiz and Frizzell were in the same apartment as 20-year-old Zachary Sutterfield, who survived the fire. However, Sutterfield suffered a traumatic brain injury and third-degree burns to roughly 70 percent of his body and remains hospitalized, according to the newspaper. Autopsy reports were sealed because of the ongoing investigation, FOX7 Austin reported. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives investigators announced last month the fire was intentionally set. No suspects or motives have been identified. Gina Ortiz, the mother of David Ortiz, told the Express-News she wants justice for the victims. “The worst possible scenario, the worst we could have imagined, has turned out to be true,” she wrote in a message to the newspaper. “No one deserved this. We are hoping and praying that someone will come forward with information to bring justice for all of our children who died in such a tragic way…They deserve justice.” A $10,000 reward was offered to anyone with information leading to an arrest or conviction in the fire."	nonTerrorism	Crime
Amazon delivery driver accused of stealing packages in Utah: He was ‘feeling like the Grinch’	"An Amazon delivery driver stole packages, including one with a book about Jesus Christ's birth, from several homes in Utah by pretending to drop off the parcels before swapping them out, police said. Robert Powell was charged with five counts of theft after he admitted to stealing packages meant for residents in North Salt Lake and Weber County, FOX13 Salt Lake City reported. “[He was] feeling like the Grinch, and he was taking packages from those he felt didn't deserve them and keeping them for himself,” North Salt Lake Police Sgt. Mitch Gwilliam told the news station. A man told FOX13 he spotted Powell acting suspiciously last week while delivering an Amazon package to his house. He recalled the driver getting out of a van and swapping a package that was already on his porch for a different parcel. The man added he quickly realized Powell didn’t deliver his package but instead stole it, while he watched. “I saw a text from my wife saying, 'hey, there's an expensive amazon delivery. Please pick it up,' and then I realized what happened,” he said. The man called police, who said they received similar calls about the Amazon delivery driver. Officers located Powell with the packages he took, the contents of which included a jacket, camera, soaps and the book ""A Savior Is Born."" “He'd come up with some sort of a scheme to make it look like the packages were being delivered, and then immediately taking them back and keeping them for himself,” Gwilliam said. Amazon released a statement to FOX13 saying Powell was fired from his position. ""This kind of behavior is unacceptable and does not reflect the high standards we have for delivery service partners,” the company said in a statement. “This individual is no longer delivering Amazon packages, and we are working with law enforcement as they investigate."""	nonTerrorism	Crime
"Ohio sheriff accused of taking money during drug arrests to fund gambling problem, complaint says"	"An Ohio sheriff is accused in an anonymous complaint of confiscating cash from drug arrests and using it to fund his gambling addiction. The complaint, filed on Nov. 9, accused Pike County Sheriff Charles S. Reader of taking the money from drug arrests from a safe that is kept in the sheriff’s office. “He is a compulsive gambler and never has any money,” the complaint said, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer. OHIO POLICE OFFICER PENS EMOTIONAL PLEA TO SPEEDERS AFTER TICKETING TEEN FOR DRIVING 100 MPH Reader borrowed thousands of dollars from two deputies and blew it on gambling, the complaint also alleged. It also stated his daughter drove cars impounded by the sheriff’s office. “Reader just does whatever he wants and no one ever calls him on it,” the complaint stated. “We are scared to death of him.” Reader’s attorney, James T. Boulger, told the Columbus Dispatch that he was “not aware of” the sheriff having a gambling problem. He said the ""main focus"" of the auditor's investigation will be whether the sheriff confiscated money during the arrests. 2 CHICAGO POLICE OFFICERS RESPONDING TO A SHOTS-FIRED CALL ARE STRUCK, KILLED BY TRAIN “I think that may be cleared up pretty quickly,” he said.

Japan urges Myanmar to conduct credible Rohingya probe	"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told Myanmar's leader Tuesday that a credible investigation into alleged human rights violations against Rohingya Muslims is key to resolving tensions in the country's Rakhine state. Abe told a joint news conference after holding talks with Aung San Suu Kyi that Japan will support efforts by Myanmar to accommodate Rohingya who return home from refugee camps in neighboring Bangladesh. ""This problem is complicated and serious, and Japan will think with Myanmar and support its effort in resolving the problem,"" Abe said. ""A credible investigation by the independent panel is particularly important."" Buddhist-majority Myanmar's military is accused of widespread rights violations, including rape, murder, torture and burning villages, which sent about 700,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh since August last year. Suu Kyi's government has rejected independent international investigations into the alleged abuses and has commissioned its own probe. Suu Kyi agreed Tuesday on the importance of an ""accurate and appropriate"" investigation. She defended the government-commissioned panel as free and effective, and its members — one each from Japan and the Philippines and two from Myanmar — as experts on human rights and international issues. ""I welcome Japan's support for our efforts for the refugees' return,"" said Suu Kyi, who is in Tokyo for a six-nation Mekong regional summit hosted by Japan. Myanmar commissioned the panel after rights groups called for the International Criminal Court to investigate the alleged abuses. Myanmar's government, which is not a member of the court in The Hague, rejected any participation in its proceedings. Myanmar authorities, including the army, have conducted their own inquiries and declared their forces free of criminal actions, leading critics to treat the latest government-formed commission as an effort to whitewash what the United Nations has characterized as ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Brussels Jewish museum shooting suspect appears in court	"A man accused of shooting dead four people at a Jewish museum in Belgium in 2014 after fighting alongside extremists in Syria appeared in court Thursday amid high security, as preparations began for his trial next month. French national Mehdi Nemmouche, 33, is accused of ""terrorist murder"" for gunning down the four with a handgun and an assault rifle in the Brussels Jewish museum in May 2014. His alleged accomplice, Nacer Bendrer, 30, also appeared in court. Nemmouche has said he was involved but did not carry out the killings. The slaying was one of the first in Europe involving so-called foreign fighters — often young, radicalized people who trained or fought with the Islamic State group or other extremists — who returned home to commit atrocities like the November 2015 Paris attacks and the Brussels suicide bombings four months later. Nemmouche's lawyer Sebastien Courtoy said his client ""is here to proclaim his innocence."" Asked whether Nemmouche would testify, Courtoy said that ""if circumstances require it, he will speak. He's not mute."" Security camera video from the May 24, 2014 killing shows a shooter wearing a baseball cap coolly gun down two people at the museum entrance, then pull out an assault rifle to spray the others from a doorway. It was over in 82 seconds and the killer strode away. An Israeli couple visiting the city and two museum workers were killed. Nemmouche, who is believed to have fought alongside Islamic State members in Syria, was captured in France almost a week later. He had been under surveillance by French and Belgian security services. French authorities also identified him as one of the jihadists who kept four French journalists hostage until they were freed in April 2014 in Syria. The trial is expected to start on Jan. 10, although defense lawyers have requested a two-week delay to examine extra evidence submitted by prosecutors. It is expected to last six to seven weeks."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Onetime Indian politician convicted in 1984 anti-Sikh riots	"An Indian court on Monday convicted a former politician for his role in riots that swept India in 1984, leaving thousands of Sikhs dead in bloody pogroms, and sentenced him to life in prison. The Delhi High Court reversed an earlier acquittal of Sajjan Kumar in the riots, which broke out after then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was killed by her Sikh bodyguards. The 73-year-old Kumar, then a leader in Gandhi's Congress party, was convicted of inciting a New Delhi mob to kill a Sikh family. He was ordered to surrender by Dec. 31 to begin serving his sentence. More than 3,000 Sikhs were killed just in New Delhi in the riots. A handful of other officials have been imprisoned for the violence, but India's criminal justice system moves painfully slowly. Powerful suspects are often able to dodge prosecution. In their ruling, the judges said many of those responsible for the 1984 riots had escaped justice for too long. ""A majority of the perpetrators of these horrific mass crimes enjoyed political patronage and were aided by an indifferent law enforcement agency. . The criminals escaped prosecution and punishment for over two decades,"" they wrote. The judges also wrote that ""there appeared to be ongoing large-scale efforts to suppress the cases against"" Kumar. Gandhi was killed after violently suppressing a Sikh insurgency that culminated in an army assault on the Golden Temple, the holiest site in Sikhism, where militant Sikhs had taken refuge. In the days after her death, mobs of Hindus went from house to house across northern India, pulling Sikhs from their homes, hacking many to death and burning others alive."	nonTerrorism	Religion
"Locked away, forgotten: Muslim Uighur wives of Pakistani men"	"The last time Chaudhry Javed Atta saw his wife was over a year ago — the Pakistani trader in dried and fresh produce was leaving their home in northwestern China's heavily Muslim Xinjiang region to go back to his country to renew his visa. He remembers the last thing she told him: ""As soon as you leave, they will take me to the camp and I will not come back."" That was August, 2017. By then, Atta and Amina Manaji, from the Muslim ethnic Uighur group native to Xinjiang, had been married for 14 years. Atta is one of scores of Pakistani businessmen __ and he says there are more than 200 __ whose spouses have disappeared, taken to what Chinese authorities tell them are education centers. Beijing has been accused of interning members of its Muslim population — by some reports as many as 1 million — to ""re-educate"" them away from their faith. It is seen as a response to riots and violent attacks that the government blamed on separatists. ""They call them schools, but they are prisons,"" Atta said. ""They can't leave."" Pakistanis often rally loudly in defense of Islam and Muslims whenever they are perceived offended around the world — most recently over cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad. In 1989, protests spread from Pakistan elsewhere, leading to the fatwa by Iran's Ayatollah Ruholla Khomeini against author Salman Rushdie for his depiction of Islam in his book Satanic Verses. But political and economic factors, including concerns about losing out on vast Chinese investments, have kept Pakistan and other Muslim countries silent about the plight in China of fellow Muslims, the Uighurs. ""Cold, hard interests will always carry the day"" in international relations, said Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program at the Washington-based Wilson Center. ""The Muslim world's deafening silence about China's treatment of Muslims can be attributed to its strong interest in maintaining close relations with the world's next superpower."" China is financing major development projects in cash-strapped Pakistan. Islamabad says Beijing's up to $75 billion development project known the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor — part of an effort to reconstruct the historic Silk Road linking China to all corners of Asia — will bring new prosperity to Pakistan, where the average citizen lives on just $125 a month. For Atta, it's not just the separation from his wife. He has also had to leave their two sons, who are 5 and 7 years old and whose passports were confiscated by the Chinese government, in the care of his wife's family. Otherwise, he said, the authorities would have put them in an orphanage. He went back to China twice for a few months but both times his visas expired and he had to return to Pakistan. Getting in touch with family in Xinjiang is a circuitous route that involves reaching out to Pakistani friends still there, who then track down family members willing to talk. ""Now especially I am worried. It is now eight, almost nine months, that I have not seen my children,"" he said. ""I haven't even been able to talk to them."" Last week, Atta finally talked to his brother-in-law after a friend discovered he had a heart attack and was recovering in a hospital in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang. ""He said my sons were good, but he had no news of my wife,"" said Atta. China routinely responds to queries on Uighurs by saying its policies are aimed at creating ""stability and lasting peace"" in Xinjiang but President Xi Jinping's campaign to subdue a sometimes restive region, including the internment of more than 1 million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities, has alarmed a United Nations panel and the U.S. government. Mushahid Hussain, chairman of Pakistan's Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, said the cardinal principle of Pakistan-China relations is to refrain from commenting on anything to do with the other country's domestic issues. ""Given the relationship of Pakistan with China, and in the Muslim world in particular, the Chinese narrative is apparently being accepted across the board as the one that is correct,"" Hussain said. A steady stream of Pakistani men has visited Beijing in recent months , lobbying for the release of their wives to little avail. Some say they met Pakistan's ambassador to China, Masood Khalid, on multiple occasions, and were told their issues were raised privately with the Chinese. Another Pakistani man in a similar predicament, Mir Aman, went to China more than 25 years ago as a poor laborer in search of work. There, he met his wife, Maheerban Gul, they worked hard and eventually bought a hotel. The couple has two daughters, Shahnaz, 16, and Shakeela, 12, both now with their father in Pakistan. Last year, Aman first tried to go back to China alone, but the authorities denied him entry at a border crossing without his wife. Then they returned together to Xinjiang. There, she was ordered to report every morning to the police, who gave her books on the Communist Party to read. ""When they would see anything written in Urdu, a prayer mat or something related to religion, they would seize it,"" he said. ""They want to eliminate Islam."" After a few weeks, Aman was ordered to leave even though he had a six-month visa. He was told he could return after one month. When he did, his wife was gone. For four months he pestered police every day, threatened to take his life in public. He was finally allowed to see his wife, who was brought to a local police station, for just an hour. They cried. When the meeting ended he was told to go home to Pakistan ""and stop making trouble for the administration,"" Aman said. He has no idea where she is being held.

 Yemen's contested port city of Aden shows challenge of peace	"Yemen's government nearly saw itself pushed into the sea by advancing rebels here three years ago. Now the port city of Aden shows the challenges that will likely still plague the nation following any potential peace agreement. Bursts of heavy machine gun fire still punctuates the nights in Aden, now marked with war-shattered buildings and questions over what an end to its war might mean for a region where secessionist flags appear to fly everywhere. As a round of peace talks in Sweden ended Thursday between the government and Houthi rebels, foreign journalists on a tour organized by the Saudi-led military coalition saw a city needing huge sums of money and aid. A Central Bank official spoke of a hoped-for infusion of $3 billion by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, underscoring the long road ahead for the Arab world's poorest country as U.S. lawmakers grow increasingly uneasy about America's role in the conflict. ""The road ahead is extremely difficult,"" said Adam Baron, a Yemen analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations and the Washington-based think tank New America. ""Security issues remain extremely perilous in the city of Aden, the economy remains in deep trouble and the currency continues to fluctuate."" Yemen, the southern undercarriage of the Arabian Peninsula also home to oil-rich Saudi Arabia and the Dubai skyscrapers of the United Arab Emirates, was torn by decades of warfare prior to this current conflict. Rebels known as Houthis stormed into the capital, Sanaa, in September 2014 and later seized power from the country's internationally recognized government. The Houthis, members of a Shiite sect, pushed government forces south and almost entirely out of Aden before Saudi and Emirati forces backed by other nations like the U.S. launched a war against them in March 2015. The Houthis, an armed group of followers of the Zaidi sect of Shiite Islam, still hold Sanaa and surrounding areas in Yemen's north. More than 60,000 people have been killed since 2016, according to the U.S.-based Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, or ACLED, which tracks Yemen's war. The fighting has also displaced 2 million others, spawned a cholera epidemic and pushed the country to the brink of famine as emaciated children die of malnutrition. Millions wake up hungry each day, not knowing where their next meal will come from. On the surface, life appears to be humming on in Aden. Fishermen secure their catches in the sun-soaked waters of the Gulf of Aden. Cashiers thump through giant wads of cash at the Central Bank. But Yemen's currency, though making recent gains, has heavily depreciated in the war. Government salaries, a major economic driver, dried up for those in Houthi-controlled areas. ""We need international support in the upcoming year to fill the gap and allow us to pay salaries to Yemeni citizens,"" said Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed, the prime minister of Yemen's internationally recognized government. ""Supporting Yemen's economy will largely impact the humanitarian situation in Yemen."" Saudi Arabia has deposited billions into Yemen's Central Bank to support the country. Officials hope another $3 billion soon will come from Kuwait and the UAE, said Shokeib Hobeishy, the deputy head of Central Bank. He also said he hoped the country would be able to once again export oil for international sales. ""Oil exports used to amount to 76 percent of the country's income,"" Hobeishy said. ""This is one of the main reasons that we stress the importance of resuming Yemen's capability to export oil."" Yet Western fatigue with the Saudi-led war is growing. The killing and dismemberment of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul, allegedly by members of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's royal entourage, has fueled the anger of U.S. lawmakers. Already, the U.S. refueling of Saudi warplanes has stopped after months of indiscriminate airstrikes on hospitals and markets, killing civilians. Saeed, Yemen's prime minister, invoked the regional threat from Iran as a reason America needed to remain involved in the conflict, something earlier echoed on a trip last month to Yemen by U.S. Ambassador Matthew Tueller. United Nations experts, Western nations and analysts say Iran supplies the Houthis with weapons ranging from assault rifles up to the ballistic missiles the rebels can now fire deeply into Saudi Arabia to target its capital, Riyadh. Iran denies arming the rebels. ""Yemen's security and the stability of the region is the most important thing right now,"" Saeed said. ""The United States' decision should take into account what Iran is doing in the region and the role it plays in Yemen."" Peace talks over ending the war wrapped up Thursday in Rimbo, Sweden, with the warring sides agreeing to a cease-fire in the strategic port city of Hodeida, where fighting has disrupted vital aid deliveries for the entire country, and a withdrawal of combatants from the city's front lines. The agreement is considered an important first step toward further talks in January aimed at drawing down the stalemated conflict. However, more conflicts lurk just beneath the war. Throughout Aden, murals bore the flag of the former Communist South Yemen. Even soldiers escorting foreign journalists in Aden flew the tricolor red, white and black flag, its light blue chevron and red star flapping in the wind. ""It's quite clear that many Southern secessionists are now empowered; the key moving forward is going to be the solution to the southern issue,"" said Baron, the Yemen analyst. ""Yemen will not have any sort of wider-range stability until the southern issue is dealt with in some form, and I think that's something obvious that you can't ignore if you're walking or driving through the streets of Aden.""

Once-powerful Cardinal convicted on sex-abuse-related charges in Australia	"A Cardinal who once held the Vatican’s third-most-powerful position was reportedly found guilty Wednesday in Australia of charges related to sexual abuse. Cardinal George Pell, who has professed his innocence, was convicted on all charges of sexually molesting two choirboys in the late 1990s in Australia, the Daily Beast reported, citing two sources with knowledge of the conviction. Local media are forbidden from publishing any news or details about the Melbourne trial due to a court-issued gag order. Pell, the Vatican’s finance chief and the highest Vatican official to ever go on trial for sex abuse, left Rome in June 2017 to stand trial in Melbourne. One Australian courtroom observer told the Washington Post that Pell’s sentencing proceedings would begin in February and he will be tried next year on additional charges. The Vatican did not address the explosive case, but did announce the removal of Pell, 77, and Chilean Cardinal Javier Errazuriz. Errazuriz, 85, is accused by Chilean abuse survivors of having covered up for predator priests during his time as archbishop of Santiago. Errazuriz has denied the charges. Their continued presence on Pope Francis' informal cabinet, the so-called Group of 9, or C-9, had been a source of scandal for Francis, given the explosion of the abuse and cover-up crisis this year. The scandal even reached Francis himself after his strong defense of a Chilean bishop accused of covering for the country's most notorious predator priest. Francis reportedly took the position on the advice of Errazuriz and later apologized. The Vatican said, for now, Pell and Errazuriz won't be replaced."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Philippines: 66 alleged militants convicted in kidnappings	"A Philippine court on Friday found 66 alleged members of the Abu Sayyaf guilty of kidnapping dozens of students, teachers and a Catholic priest in the south in 2000, in the largest single conviction involving the brutal Muslim militant group. The Regional Trial Court branch 261 acquitted for lack of evidence 20 other people who have languished in jail for a number of years while insisting they were innocent in the brazen March 2000 kidnappings of 52 people, mostly young students at two schools on Basilan island. Two kidnapped teachers were beheaded and a priest died while in Abu Sayyaf custody. The other hostages were rescued or freed after local officials negotiated for their release a few days after they were kidnapped en masse from the schools in the villages of Tumahubong and Sinangkapan. The Abu Sayyaf — or Bearer of the Sword — has been listed as a terrorist group by the U.S. It was founded around the early 1990s in poor, predominantly Muslim Basilan province. An unwieldy collection of Islamic preachers and outlaws, it vowed to wage jihad, or holy war, but lost its key leaders early in combat, sending it on a violent path of extremism and criminality. One of its top commanders, Isnilon Hapilon, helped lead a siege of southern Marawi city by Islamic State group-aligned militants in May last year which left more than 1,000 people dead, mostly militants, including Hapilon. Hundreds of thousands of villagers were displaced. Troops backed by U.S. and Australian spy planes quelled the siege after five months. Today, the Abu Sayyaf has degenerated into a few loose factions with a few hundred ragtag fighters and no central leader in Basilan and outlying islands. But it remains resilient and violent, engaging in ransom kidnappings and extortion that have allowed it to survive without extensive backing from foreign extremist groups. Senior State Prosecutor Peter Ong said some innocent suspects were arrested but only two were freed by the court a few years ago after he and other prosecutors took steps to secure their release before the trial ended. ""The persistence and determination of the court to give justice to the victims and those who were wrongfully arrested led to this decision, although it took more than one and a half decades to happen,"" said Ong, one of several prosecutors who handled the case. Nearly 100 people were charged in the Basilan kidnappings. An Associated Press investigation in 2014 that included interviews with prosecutors and key witnesses showed dozens of people were detained despite a lack of evidence against them. An Abu Sayyaf commander, Abu Gandhie, who took part in the planning but was captured and later turned state witness, told the AP at the time that more than 40 militants took part in the mass kidnappings, including more than 10 who were later killed in clashes with troops. When he testified in court, he identified only 12 of the dozens of men who were charged as among those who actually took part in the abductions. Mistakes are a concern in the Philippines' slow and overburdened law enforcement and criminal justice system, which has a backlog of thousands of cases and is tainted by corruption allegations. In far-flung Muslim regions in the south, those frailties are compounded by conditions such as a lack of birth certificates and other identification papers for poor villagers, hampering the accurate identification of suspects. With spotty intelligence, government forces have often relied on civilian informants, some with questionable backgrounds, human rights advocates say."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Thai Islamic leaders tighten rules on child marriage	"Islam's guiding council in Thailand has introduced new regulations requiring that marriages of children under age 17 be approved by a religious committee. The action follows an uproar earlier this year over an 11-year-old Thai girl who married a 41-year-old Malaysian man, triggering calls in both countries for stronger laws against child marriage. The girl was reportedly sent back to Thailand from Malaysia and put under the care of Thai social welfare workers. A senior member of the Central Islamic Council of Thailand, Wisut Binlateh, said Friday that Muslim children of any age in Thailand previously could get married with permission from their parents, but now children under age 17 must also seek approval from an Islamic committee which would consider whether the marriage is appropriate. Wisut said the measure took effect Dec. 4, when the Sheikhul Islam, the senior Thai Muslim leader, signed his approval. Human rights activist Angkhana Neelaphaijit said the regulation does not carry the weight of law, and holds no punishment for those who fail to abide by it. Islamic law is observed for Muslims in Thailand's four southernmost provinces for family matters and inheritance, but does not set a minimum age for marriage. Three of the four provinces are the only ones with Muslim majorities in the Buddhist-dominated country, while the fourth has a substantial Muslim community. According to Thai law, which applies to the rest of the country, the minimum legal age for marriage is 17, though courts may allow the marriage of younger individuals if there is an appropriate reason. The reasons, however, are not defined in the law. Angkhana said the new measure by Thailand's Islamic leaders is a step in the right direction, but requires further work to protect people's rights. ""It is a good thing that the Sheikhul Islam Office has introduced this measure, but we have to also try to reach an understanding with the religious leaders that if there are violators, what can we do to punish them,"" she said. Angkhana also said because Thailand's four southern provinces use Islamic law for family matters, a legal loophole has allowed a surge in Malaysian men coming to southern Thailand for second or third marriages, because there is little oversight compared to what they face at home. ""The problem is in Malaysia, if a man wants to have a second or third wife, he needs to ask permission from a court. But in Thailand, there is no such law regulating this or also anyone checking whether a man is wealthy enough to care for a family,"" she said."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Philippine Congress votes to extend martial law in south	"The Philippine Congress on Wednesday approved a request by the president to extend martial law in the country's volatile south by a year due to continuing threats by Islamic State group-linked militants and communist insurgents. An overwhelming majority in the Senate and House of Representatives voted to extend martial rule, which expires at the end of the month, by another year in southern Mindanao region, scene of decades-long Muslim and communist rebellions in the largely Roman Catholic nation. President Rodrigo Duterte placed the southern region under martial law after hundreds of Islamic State group-linked militants attacked the Islamic city of Marawi on May 23, 2017, in the worst security crisis he has faced. Troops quelled the siege after five months but officials say surviving militants continue to recruit new fighters and plot bombings and other attacks. ""Now more than ever, we cannot afford to show our enemies a moment of weakness in our resolve to defeat them,"" Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea told the joint session of Congress. He warned that if Muslim militants and communist insurgents are allowed to regroup, ""this government will not be able to function fully, basic services to the people will continuously be hindered, and the safety of the general public will remain to be under constant threat."" Muslim militants, backed by foreign extremists, are fighting to turn the Philippines into a province of a so-called Muslim caliphate, while other armed groups aim to establish a separate Muslim homeland, Medialdea said. Opponents argue that extending martial law is unconstitutional because it is an ""extreme measure"" that can only be imposed when an actual rebellion against the government exists. They say the move could be a prelude for Duterte to declare martial law throughout the Philippines. Opposition Rep. Edcel Lagman said the government's repeated requests for extensions of martial law show the military and police have failed to achieve their objectives under martial rule. ""I think this undue prolongation of martial law in Mindanao would amount to perpetuity,"" Lagman said. Other opposition lawmakers argued that government forces could fight insurgents in remote rural areas and allow economic growth without martial law. At least 143 suspected militants have been arrested and charged with rebellion since martial rule was imposed across the south, where a number of extremist groups, including the brutal Abu Sayyaf group which still has more than 400 fighters, continue to pose threats, military officials said. Left-wing lawmakers questioned a military claim that not one case of human rights violations has occurred under martial law in the south. Outside the House, activists staged a noisy protest, expressing fears that left-wing groups and human rights defenders will be targeted under martial law. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana pledged that the military will protect ""the democratic way of life of our people, with full respect for human rights, international humanitarian law and the primacy of the rule of law."" Filipinos remain hypersensitive to threats to democracy and civil liberties after they ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos in a 1986 ""people power"" revolt that became a harbinger of change in authoritarian regimes worldwide. Marcos declared martial law in the Philippines in 1972 in a period marked by massive human rights abuses. Concerns over Duterte's martial law have been sparked in part by his perceived authoritarian bent and the killings of thousands of suspects in a crackdown on illegal drugs that he launched after taking office in 2016. Associated Press journalist Alberto ""Bullit"" Marquez contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Myanmar rally urges release of 'Person of Year' journalists	"Several dozen journalists and activists held a rally Wednesday in Myanmar's biggest city to mark the anniversary of the arrest of two reporters for the Reuters news agency who are among a group of journalists being honored by Time magazine as its ""Person of the Year."" The protesters wore T-shirts calling for the release of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who had reported on a brutal military-led crackdown on the Muslim Rohingya minority. They were arrested a year ago and charged with illegal possession of official documents. The two, who were sentenced in September to seven years' imprisonment, denied the charge and said they were framed by police. Their appeal is expected to be heard later this month. The protesters near Myanmar's High Court carried placards with the cover of some editions of Time's next issue that show a picture of the men's wives holding photos of their husbands. They also released black balloons into the sky and lit candles. Paling Soe Oo, one of the journalists who joined the rally, said the magazine's focus on the jailed journalists was an honor for Myanmar and its journalism community. ""But I don't think the government feels shame for its part, and isn't considering releasing them, not even a little,"" he said. The reporting by the two men about the military campaign that drove 700,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh is believed to have drawn the government's wrath because of worldwide condemnation of military abuses, which it denies. ""A year ago, Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were arrested in a setup by police, intended to interfere with their reporting on a massacre in Myanmar,"" Reuters editor-in-chief Stephen J. Adler said in a statement prepared for the anniversary of their arrests. ""The fact that they remain in prison for a crime they did not commit calls into question Myanmar's commitment to democracy, freedom of expression and rule of law. Every day they continue to be behind bars is a missed opportunity for Myanmar to stand up for justice. The people of Myanmar deserve the freedoms and democracy they have long been promised, and Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo deserve to be returned to their families and colleagues immediately,"" he said. More than 50 major international, regional, and Myanmar-based human rights and free speech organizations have condemned the arrest and conviction of the two men. Prosecution testimony at the men's trial was weak and inconsistent, and a police officer gave testimony confirming defense allegations of a setup. After testifying, the officer was dismissed from his job and sent to prison for violating police regulations. The case is widely seen as an example of how democratic reforms in long-isolated Myanmar have stalled under the civilian government of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, which took power in 2016. Although the military, which ruled the country for a half century, maintains control of several key ministries, Suu Kyi's rise had raised hopes for an accelerated transition to full democracy, and her stance on the Rohingya crisis and press freedom has disappointed many former admirers."	nonTerrorism	Religion
"Nobel laureate returns to Iraq, pledges to work for peace"	"Iraqi activist Nadia Murad met her country's president in Baghdad on Wednesday after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize for her advocacy on behalf of victims of wartime sexual violence. Murad, a member of Iraq's Yazidi minority, was among thousands of women and girls who were captured and forced into sexual slavery by Islamic State militants in 2014. She became an activist on behalf of women and girls after escaping and finding refuge in Germany. She arrived in Baghdad from Stockholm on Wednesday, and was received by President Barham Salih. ""There is no meaning to the Nobel prize without the ongoing work for the sake of peace,"" Murad told group of community leaders and foreign ambassadors at the presidential palace. Yazidis are followers of an ancient faith who are falsely branded devil-worshippers by Sunni extremists. When the Islamic Sate group swept into northern Iraq in 2014, the militants massacred thousands of Yazidi men and enslaved an estimated 7,000 women and girls. Many managed to escape as U.S.-backed Iraqi forces gradually drove the militants from all the territory they once held in a grueling 3-year campaign, but some 3,000 Yazidi women and girls are still missing. Murad called on the Iraqi government and the U.S.-led coalition to search for the missing. She also called on the government to rebuild her hometown, Sinjar. More than 80 percent of Yazidis are still living in displacement camps. In her Nobel speech on Monday, Murad urged world leaders to put an end to sexual violence, saying ""the only prize in the world that can restore our dignity is justice and the prosecution of criminals."" Iraq's president said Murad ""embodies the suffering and tragedies Iraqis have gone through in the past and represents the courage and determination to defend rights in the face of the oppressor."" The Yazidis had endured a ""heinous and a rare crime in history,"" Salih said and called on parliament to pass a law recognizing it as a genocide. Murad later met Hadi al-Amiri and Falih al-Fayadh, top leaders of Iraq's Popular Mobilization militia umbrella, which played a key role in the war against IS. The militias are jointly responsible, with Iraqi federal forces, for the security of Sinjar. As Murad was receiving her prize in Oslo, Iraq celebrated the anniversary of its costly victory over IS, which still carries out sporadic attacks and controls a remote enclave just across the border in Syria. The war left tens of thousands dead, and destroyed entire neighborhoods and towns. Some 1.8 million people are still displaced from their homes.

"Dozens of Chinese Christians detained in raid on underground church, group says"	"Chinese authorities detained at least 80 Christians in a raid on a prominent church that operates outside the umbrella of the Beijing government's official Protestant organization, an advocacy group said Monday. Texas-based ChinaAid said the pastor of the Early Rain Covenant Church and his wife were among those detained in the southwestern city of Chengdu starting Sunday night. China has cracked down heavily on independent church groups this year as part of a move to suppress all religions. The government requires that Protestants worship only in churches recognized and regulated by the Three-Self Patriotic Movement. Even within that framework, the officially atheist ruling Communist Party has been seeking to rein in religious expression, including removing crosses from official and unofficial churches. Early Rain is believed to have several hundred members who meet in different locations around Chengdu, a sprawling city with a population of nearly 15 million. Many of those detained, including church pastor Wang Yi, were seized from their homes overnight Sunday, ChinaAid said. ""The massive overnight attack against members of the independent, renowned Early Rain Covenant Church represents a major escalation of religious persecution in China,"" Bob Fu, ChinaAid's founder and president, said in a statement on the group's website. The crackdown, which extended into international Human Rights Day on Monday, shows the administration of President Xi Jinping is ""deliberately making itself the enemy of universal values, such as religious freedom for all,"" said Fu, who is a close friend of Pastor Wang. CHINA SAYS IT SUMMONED U.S. AMBASSADOR AMID HUAWEI SCANDAL Tens of millions of Chinese identify as Christians, most of them Protestant, and their ranks have been increasing rapidly despite the Communist Party's efforts to limit them. Their numbers rival the membership of the ruling party, which stands at around 90 million."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Pope cites the 'disappeared' among those deprived of rights	"Pope Francis on Monday lamented that the poor, the unborn, those imprisoned and those who have been forcibly ""disappeared"" do not enjoy the same human rights protections as the wealthy. Francis marked the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with a message read at the start of a Vatican-backed conference. In it, Francis said there were ""numerous contradictions"" in the way the U.N. declaration was applied and blamed the world's profit-motivated economy that exploits the poor for the injustices experienced by the world's most vulnerable. ""While one part of humanity lives in opulence, another sees their dignity unrecognized ... their fundamental rights ignored or violated,"" he said. He cited the unborn, those deprived of education and dignified work, as well as prisoners who are tortured and held in ""unhuman conditions."" But Francis also cited ""victims of forced disappearances and their families."" It was a rare reference for Francis, who was Jesuit superior in his native Argentina during the 1976-1983 ""Dirty War,"" the right-wing military government's crackdown on leftist dissidents. Official estimates say between 7,600-13,000 people were killed or forcibly ""disappeared"" during the crackdown; human rights activists believe the real number was as high as 30,000. Francis rarely refers in public to the bloody period of Argentina's past. But he has met with representatives of the ""Mothers of Plaza de Mayo,"" who have campaigned for years for information about the disappeared and their children, many of whom were secretly taken from their birth families and given up for adoption. In 2016, Francis authorized the opening of archives from the Vatican and the Argentine church for consultation by victims and their families. Many senior Catholic clerics were close to Argentina's military rulers at the time and human rights groups have accused them of complicity with the regime. Francis himself had been criticized for not speaking out publicly about the atrocities while a high-ranking Jesuit. But he has also been credited with saving the lives of more than two dozen people, giving them sanctuary in his seminary and helping spirit them out of the country."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Malaysian Muslims stage rally to uphold Malay privileges	" Tens of thousands of Malaysian Muslims rallied Saturday in Kuala Lumpur against any attempt to strip the ethnic Malay majority of its privileges, in the first massive street gathering since Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's alliance won a historic vote in May. The rally, backed by the country's two largest opposition Malay parties, was initially aimed at protesting a government plan to ratify a U.N. treaty against racial discrimination that critics allege will end Malay privileges under a decades-old affirmative action policy. The plan was eventually abandoned, but organizers decided to proceed with what they called a ""thanksgiving"" rally. Mahathir said the government allowed the rally as part of democracy, but warned against any chaos. The rally was held under tight police security, but ended peacefully after rain started to fall. Former Prime Minister Najib Razak, who has been charged with multiple counts of corruption, was among opposition lawmakers at the rally. Police said there were at least 55,000 people on the streets. Many wore white T-shirts and headbands with the words ""Reject ICERD,"" referring to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Rally-goers gathered at three locations before marching to a nearby historic square, chanting ""Long live the Malays"" and ""Crush ICERD."" ""Yes, we did not ratify the ICERD, but we are still here to say that we are still against it,"" said shopkeeper Rosli Ikhsan. ""Even if the government has said they won't endorse it, we are still protesting with all our might from all of Malaysia."" Mahathir's new government won a stunning victory in a May 9 general election amid anger over a massive corruption scandal involving Najib and his government, but many Malays still support Najib's party, the United Malays National Organization, and the Malaysian Islamic Party, which controls two of the country's 13 states. Some analysts say Najib and his party were using the rally to shift attention away from corruption charges against Najib, his wife, his party's president and former government officials. ""For me, ICERD is bad,"" university student Nurul Qamariah said at the rally. ""It's bad because it will erode the position of Malays. This is a country for Malays. We want Malays to be superiors, but why do these people want to make Malays the same level as Chinese and Indians?"" Racial clashes have been rare in multiracial Malaysia since deadly race riots in 1969. A year later, Malaysia instituted a preferential program that gives Malays privileges in jobs, education, contracts and housing to help narrow a wealth gap with the minority Chinese. Ethnic Malays account for nearly two-thirds of the country's 32 million people, with large Chinese and Indian minorities. Saturday's rally came less than two weeks after more than 80 people were arrested in a riot at an Indian temple in a suburb outside Kuala Lumpur. The government was quick to stress that the violence was due to a land dispute and was not a racial riot. Still, the government warned Saturday's rally-goers not to make any provocative statements that could fan racial tensions.

Catholic monks killed in Algeria's civil war are beatified	"A cardinal dispatched by the Vatican to Algeria held an unusual beatification ceremony on Saturday for 19 monks, nuns and other Catholics who were killed during Algeria's civil war in the 1990s. It was the first such ceremony in the Muslim world, according to Algeria's religious affairs minister. It came after Pope Francis recognized all 19 as martyrs in January, paving the way for Saturday's ceremony in the western Algerian city of Oran. Beatification is a step in the process of being declared a saint. Cardinal Angelo Becciu, prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, celebrated Saturday's Mass at the Notre Dame de Santa Cruz basilica as the pope's special envoy. Those honored included seven French Trappist monks who were abducted from the monastery of Tibhirine, south of Algiers, in 1996. Soon afterward, their skulls were discovered nearby; their bodies were never found. A radical group was blamed for their beheadings, but some observers have suggested Algeria's military was responsible. The Algerian president agreed to allow and co-organize the beatification events in Algeria, despite some lingering tensions over the deaths. Algeria's religious affairs minister, ambassadors from several countries and other foreign dignitaries attended the event. A moment of silence was held for all the victims of what Algerians call the ""black decade,"" when some 250,000 people were killed as the army fought an Islamist insurgency. The ceremony also honored 99 imams killed in the fighting. The bishop of Oran, Jean-Pierre Vesco, also took a moment to honor the Algerian driver of a bishop who was killed in an attack in Oran in the 1990s. Pope Francis invited a crowd of about 30,000 faithful in St. Peter's Square Saturday to give a round of applause to the newly beatified in Algeria. ""These martyrs of our times were faithful announcers of the Gospel, humble builders of peace and heroic witnesses to Christian charity,"" the pope said. He added that their ""courageous witness is a source of hope for the Algerian Catholic community and a seed of dialogue for the entire society."" Francis added his hope that the beatifications would be ""a stimulus to build together a world of brotherhood and solidarity."" Associated Press writers Frances D'Emilio and Nicole Winfield in Rome contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Vatican investigates after nuns report sex abuse by priests	" The Vatican has launched an investigation into a small Chilean religious order of nuns after some sisters denounced sexual abuse at the hands of priests and mistreatment by their superiors, a turning point that shows the Holy See is now willing to investigate allegations of sexual violence against nuns. The scandal at the Institute of the Good Samaritan was revealed publicly in an investigative report by Chilean national television earlier this year at the height of outrage over how Chilean Catholic hierarchy covered up decades of sexual abuse of children by priests. In the report, a half-dozen current and former nuns said sisters were thrown out of the order after they denounced the abuse to their superiors. The report followed the sisters as they testified before two Vatican investigators sent to Chile by Pope Francis to get to the bottom of the church-wide scandal there. In a statement, the Vatican embassy to Chile announced that an ""apostolic visitation,"" or investigation, had begun Wednesday in the institute. It said over the coming months the probe would take testimony from current and former sisters and those affiliated with the institute so the Vatican can understand the situation and make whatever changes are necessary. The institute is located in the diocese of Talca, which since 1996 had been headed by Bishop Horacio del Carmen Valenzuela Abarca. Pope Francis removed Valenzuela as bishop in June as part of his cleanup of the Chilean hierarchy. Valenzuela had been one of the bishops trained by Chile's most infamous predator priests, the Rev. Fernando Karadima. As a diocesan institute of consecrated life, the Good Samaritan order was wholly dependent on the bishop and under his authority. The Vatican investigation into the abuse there marks a turning point of sorts as the Holy See in recent years has focused its attention on responding to the abuse of minors by priests. But recently, adult nuns have begun denouncing sexual violence at the hands of priests and bishops, an abuse of power that has become more recognized in the #MeToo era. The Vatican did send in an investigator in 2014 when seminarians and priests reported sexual misconduct claims against their superior, the late Scottish Cardinal Keith O'Brien. Francis eventually removed O'Brien's rights and privileges as a cardinal. A similar case erupted this year in the U.S. involving disgraced ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick. The scandal was sparked by an allegation that McCarrick abused a teenage altar boy, but exploded further when adult ex-seminarians reported that he routinely pressured them to sleep with him. An Associated Press expose this summer, which cited the Chilean case and others in Europe, Africa and India, found that the Vatican had long known about the problem of the sexual violence committed against religious sisters but done next to nothing to stop it. Church authorities have long downplayed the prevalence of the problem, often blaming the nun for seducing a priest when a scandal became known. The issue though has gained such prominence that the international association of the world's religious sisters recently issued an unprecedented statement urging that nuns report any abuse they had suffered to police and their superiors. The statement from the Union of International Superiors General, which represents 500,000 of the world's 660,000 nuns, was even more significant since it was issued to mark the U.N.'s day for the elimination of violence against women, a strong show of solidarity with all women who are victims of sexual violence."	nonTerrorism	Religion
US fails to win UN condemnation of Hamas militants in Gaza	"A U.S.-sponsored draft resolution that for the first time would have condemned the militant Islamic group Hamas, which controls Gaza, failed to win the required two-thirds majority in the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday. Before the vote on the resolution, the 193-member world body had narrowly voted to require a two-thirds majority for approval as sought by Arab nations for rather than the simple majority urged by the United States. U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley told the assembly before the vote that it could make history and unconditionally speak out against Hamas, which she called ""one of the most obvious and grotesque cases of terrorism in the world."" But the vote on the resolution to condemn Hamas was 87 in favor against 57 opposed, with 33 abstentions — a plurality but below the two-thirds requirement to adopt it. The vote to require a two-thirds majority was much closer, 75-72, with 26 abstentions and several countries changing their votes to ""yes"" at the last minute. The U.S. attempt to condemn Hamas and demand that the militant group stop firing rockets into Israel, using ""airborne incendiary devices,"" and putting civilians at risk sparked a Palestinian-backed amendment sponsored by Bolivia. It outlined the basis for comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian peace and referred to a December 2016 Security Council resolution that condemned Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem as a ""flagrant violation"" of international law. It also reaffirmed ""unwavering support"" for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — issues not included in the U.S. draft. But before the vote on the U.S. draft resolution, Bolivian Ambassador Sasha Llorentty Soliz withdrew the amendment. That was because the Palestinians and their supporters wanted a vote instead on a short rival resolution sponsored by Ireland that included the exact language of the amendment. After the U.S. draft on Hamas failed to win adoption, the General Assembly overwhelmingly approved the Irish resolution by a vote of 156-6, with 12 abstentions. It calls for ""the achievement, without delay, of a comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East"" on the basis of U.N. resolutions, singling out the December 2016 measure, and reaffirms ""unwavering support ... for the two-state solution of Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security within recognized borders, based on the pre-1967 borders."" The rival resolutions reflect the deep divisions among the 193 U.N. member states over the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict — and the failure to end it."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Pope to visit UAE in first-ever trip to Arabian Peninsula	"Pope Francis plans to visit the United Arab Emirates in February to push for Christian-Muslim dialogue and peace in the first-ever papal visit to the Arabian Peninsula. The Feb. 3-5 trip to Abu Dhabi centers around an interfaith meeting, the Vatican said Thursday. Francis will also have the chance to meet with political leaders as well as the UAE's Catholic community, which is made up almost exclusively of foreign workers. It's the latest trip to be announced in what is shaping up to be one of Francis' busiest years for foreign travel, with trips to Central America, North Africa and now the Gulf confirmed, and ones to Asia and East Africa under consideration. While Francis has visited other Muslim-majority nations, including Egypt, Turkey and Jordan, the UAE trip will mark the first pastoral visit by a pope to the Arabian Peninsula. Pope Paul VI visited Iran in 1970. The theme of the UAE trip is peace, with the logo featuring a dove carrying an olive branch. Vatican spokesman Greg Burke noted that the trip, like one last year to Egypt, shows the importance Francis places on inter-religious dialogue. ""Pope Francis visiting the Arab world is a perfect example of the culture of encounter,"" Burke said in a statement. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai and the UAE's vice president and prime minister, welcomed news of the pope's visit. The visit ""will strengthen our ties and understanding of each other, enhance interfaith dialogue and help us to work together to maintain and build peace among the nations of the world,"" he tweeted. Francis, who turns 82 this month, will make the trip just a week after returning home from Panama, where he is due to visit Jan. 22-27 to participate in the Catholic Church's World Youth Day rally. In March, Francis is due to travel to Morocco, while a 2019 trip to Japan is also under consideration. The cardinal from Madagascar has said Francis is expected to visit next year."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Bill Bennett: The important secret that the real Saint Nicholas and Santa share	"Thursday, December 6 is Saint Nicholas Day, the feast day of the Christian bishop who lived during the fourth century in what is now Turkey, and whose name we associate so much with chimneys and stockings hung with care. There is an old story about Nicholas and his remarkable generosity. When he was a young man living in his hometown of Patara, he heard of a family that had fallen on hard times. The desperate parents were too poor to provide dowries so that their three daughters could marry. They decided that the only way to keep their daughters from starving was to sell them into servitude. Nicholas put a few gold coins he had inherited into a small bag and, one night when the family was sleeping, tossed it through a window into their home. It was enough money to provide a dowry for the oldest daughter, who was soon married. When Nicholas saw the effects of his gift, he returned and tossed another bag of gold through the window so the second daughter could be married. When he came several nights later with a third bag, the tearful father was waiting to see who their secret benefactor was. Nicholas begged him not to tell anyone, but his act of generosity set him on the path to becoming the world’s most famous gift giver. Such are the stories of Nicholas that have come down to us. His life, to be sure, is obscured by time and legend. It’s a history I explore in my book, ""The True Saint Nicholas."" Nicholas was a man of God who worked tirelessly for his flock. But the most remarkable part of his story comes after his death. People began to tell stories about the bishop and his power to change people’s hearts. Because all the good he did was a kind of miracle, they told stories of the miraculous -- stories of a man who could accomplish things no ordinary person could. “It is easier to count the waves of the sea, the drops of rain, the stars, and with a glance see all the Atlantic than to recount in detail God’s marvels accomplished through Saint Nicholas,” an eighth-century hymn proclaimed. Nicholas gradually became an international phenomenon in the Old World. By the end of the fifteenth century, more than 2,500 churches, monasteries, hospitals, schools, and works of art had been dedicated to him in Western Europe. At some point in the Middle Ages, people began exchanging gifts on December 6, Saint Nicholas Day, perhaps in memory of the bishop’s generosity. In some places, children woke to find their shoes filled with fruit or nuts -- gifts from the kind old saint. We live in a time of social turmoil and drama. Nicholas’s standing endured such a time during the Reformation when Protestants turned against traditions surrounding the saints. The most zealous reformers took hammers to sculptures of Nicholas and other saints. They smashed stained-glass windows depicting their deeds. Pages containing lives of the saints were used to polish boots or wrap fish. Nicholas was driven from many churches, but he could not be driven from people’s hearts. Over the centuries, something extraordinary happened. He moved into homes and became a hero of the hearth. In America, of course, he transformed into the champion bringer of gifts. Those three bags of gold have become Santa’s sack of toys. Yes, Santa Claus (whose name comes from Sinterklass, the Dutch name for Saint Nicholas) is sometimes overexposed and exploited. At his best, though, he stands for the virtues that Saint Nicholas championed: generosity, selflessness, largeness of spirit. There is one essential truth in the stories of Nicholas and Santa Claus: the goodness of the gift offered with no expectation of anything in return. That spirit lives in any parent who with secret joy watches a wonder-struck child on Christmas morning. The legacy of Saint Nicholas has rippled across 17 centuries, bringing messages of faith and joy. His is a story worth knowing, especially this time of year."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Australian archbishop cleared of child sex abuse cover-up	"An Australian appeal court on Thursday overturned a conviction against the most senior Roman Catholic cleric ever found guilty of covering up child sex abuse. New South Wales state District Court Judge Roy Ellis upheld former Adelaide Archbishop Philip Wilson's appeal against his May conviction in a lower court for concealing the sexual abuse of two altar boys by a pedophile priest in the 1970s. Ellis found there was reasonable doubt that the 68-year-old cleric had committed the crime, which is punishable by up to two years in prison. Wilson has served almost four months of a year-long home detention sentence at his sister's house outside Newcastle. He was to become eligible for parole after serving six months. The judge also dismissed a prosecution appeal against the leniency of the sentence. Wilson was allowed to watch the decision via a video link from a remote location so he could avoid media cameras at the Newcastle court. Wilson has always maintained his innocence and after his conviction had initially refused calls for his resignation until he had exhausted his appeal options. But he quit in July after then-Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called on the Vatican to act. Administrator Delegate of the Adelaide Archdiocese, Philip Marshall — Wilson's replacement — said the church noted the judgment and welcomed the conclusion of a process that had been long and painful for all concerned. ""We now need to consider the ramifications of this outcome,"" Marshall said in a statement. ""The survivors of child sexual abuse and their families are in our thoughts and prayers, and the archdiocese remains committed to providing the safest possible environments for children and vulnerable people in our care,"" he added. The prosecution said that Wilson was told by two altar boys in 1976 that they had been abused by pedophile priest James Fletcher but did nothing about it. It was alleged he subsequently failed to go to the police after Fletcher was arrested in 2004 for abusing another boy. One of the two altar boy victims, Peter Creigh, was in tears after the judge's decision. He was too upset to comment outside court. Creigh has previously agreed to be identified in the media as a victim of child sex abuse. Another of Fletcher's victims who was not involved in the charge against Wilson, Peter Gogarty, said the Catholic Church had shown no genuine contrition for the abuse of children by clerics. ""I'm very disappointed as you'd expect. I'm disappointed at a personal level ... but more importantly, I'm very disappointed for the other people, good, honest, reliable people,"" Gogarty told reporters outside court, referring to witnesses in the trial. Newcastle Magistrate Robert Stone ""found them all very credible and very honest and those people have stood up to the might and the money of the Catholic Church and they've been deeply hurt by this decision. So, I feel terribly for them,"" Gogarty added. In May, Stone rejected the evidence of Wilson, who is suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, that he could not remember the altar boys telling him of the abuse. Fletcher was convicted in 2004 of sexually abusing another boy and died of a stroke in prison in 2006. The defense lawyers had argued Wilson was not guilty because the evidence was circumstantial and there was no evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the clergyman was told about the abuse, believed it was true or remembered being told about it. During Wilson's two-day appeal last week, prosecutor Helen Roberts urged Ellis to consider how the magistrate had the benefit of watching both Wilson and Creigh — the main witness — during the trial. The magistrate had raised doubts about the cleric's credibility before finding him guilty. Stone found Creigh had been a genuine and truthful witness who had no motive to make up the conversation he said he had with Wilson in 1976. But Ellis repeatedly stated during the appeal that Wilson was an intelligent, articulate man who appeared to be doing his best to answer questions put to him during the trial. Ellis said he was not bound by the magistrate's conclusion that many of Wilson's answers were ""dissembling and contrived."" When sentencing Wilson to home detention, Stone said the cleric had shown no remorse or contrition for the cover-up and his primary motive had been to protect the Catholic Church."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Key Ukrainian church gathering slated for next week	"Ukraine's Orthodox clerics will gather for a meeting next week that is expected to form a new, independent Ukrainian church, the country's leader said Wednesday, as the authorities ramped up pressure on priests to support the move. The Ukrainian church has been part of the Russian Orthodox Church for centuries, but Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has pushed for the creation of an independent church as he faces March's presidential election. The Russian Orthodox Church and the Kremlin have strongly condemned the move that would split the world's largest Orthodox, warning it could trigger sectarian violence. Poroshenko, who has made an independent church one of the main slogans of his not-yet-announced re-election bid, said that Orthodox communities would gather on Dec. 15 to adopt the charter of the new Ukrainian church and choose its leader. The newly formed community would then be expected to receive independence from the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, the Istanbul-based institution considered the so-called ""first among equals"" of leaders of the world's Orthodox Churches that has already drafted a charter for an independent Ukrainian church. Ukrainian authorities have sought to portray the Russian Orthodox in Ukraine as supporting Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine — claims that have been rejected by its clerics. As church tensions grew, Ukrainian national security service (SBU) searched Russian Orthodox churches and the homes of Russian Orthodox priests in several cities, stepping up pressure on the clerics. The agency also has summoned dozens of priests for regular questioning. The moves in the Ukrainian capital and in the provinces were part of a criminal investigation into inciting hatred and violence — the charges the priests dismissed as part of official campaign to coerce them into supporting the new independent Ukrainian church. On Wednesday, the SBU announced that it questioned another 14 priests in Rivne and Sarny dioceses as part of a probe on charges of high treason and inciting religious hatred. Tensions over the church come amid a bitter tug-of-war between the two neighbors that began with Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and support for separatist insurgents in eastern Ukraine. The rift escalated further after a naval incident on Nov. 25 in which the Russian coast guard fired on and seized three Ukrainian navy vessels. Poroshenko responded by declaring 30-day martial law in much of Ukraine. A previous version of this story was corrected to show that the date of the meeting as Dec. 15, not Dec. 5."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Vatican official who accused Pope Francis of covering up sex abuse is battling brother over multi-million dollar inheritance	"The retired Vatican ambassador who convulsed the Holy See with accusations of sex abuse cover-up is offering his side of the story in a different scandal: a family fight over a multi-million dollar inheritance. Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano is trying to explain an Italian court ruling requiring him to pay his brother, who also is a priest, 1.8 million euros. The court's decision generated headlines given Vigano's unprecedented call for Pope Francis to resign over alleged failures in addressing clergy sex abuse. In a statement Monday, Vigano said his brother had originally sought 40 million euros from their shared inheritance but said that a series of 10 civil, criminal and administrative cases had ruled against him. Vigano accused his brother of subjecting him to a ""judicial siege and a veritable defamation campaign in the press."" Vigano has long painted himself as a champion of transparency and paradigm of righteousness in a sea of corruption in the Catholic Church. The statement, issued by Vigano's lawyers, carried that same tone, saying Vigano deeply loved his brother, wouldn't appeal the court's decision even though he considered it ""wrong and unjust,"" and had allocated most of his inheritance to charity anyway. Vigano first made waves in 2012, when he begged Pope Benedict XVI not to be transferred from his job in the Vatican City administration for what he claimed was retaliation for his efforts to root out corruption. According to letters leaked at the time, Vigano also argued he had to stay in Rome to care for his ailing brother — the same one involved in the inheritance fight — even though the estranged brother lived in Chicago at the time. Benedict transferred Vigano anyway, making him Vatican ambassador to the U.S. There, Vigano said he sent repeated memos to his superiors in Rome about allegations that now ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, the retired archbishop of Washington, had sexually preyed on seminarians. Vigano revealed those allegations in his explosive claim published in August that Vatican officials had known since 2000 of McCarrick's alleged misdeeds, but turned a blind eye until Benedict eventually sanctioned him. Vigano accused Francis of effectively rehabilitating McCarrick in 2013 and called for him to resign. Francis hasn't responded, though he has indirectly referred to Vigano as the devil and has authorized a limited investigation of Vatican archives into the McCarrick scandal. McCarrick resigned as a cardinal in July after a church investigation found he had been credibly accused of groping a teenager."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Egypt actress says revealing dress wasn't meant to offend	"An Egyptian actress facing trial on public obscenity charges for wearing a revealing dress says she didn't mean to offend anyone, appealing to her detractors to believe in her good intentions. In a weekend Facebook post, Rania Youssef said she may have misjudged how people would react to the dress she wore at the closing ceremony of this year's Cairo International Film Festival, which revealed the entirety of her legs through embroidered gauze. In choosing that dress, she said, she had referred to fashion designers that may have been influenced by the tastes and standards at international film festivals. ""I want to repeat my commitment to the values and ethics we have been raised by in Egyptian society,"" said Youssef, without making an outright apology. Images of Youssef at the event were widely shared on social media, prompting a group of lawyers to file a complaint to the chief prosecutor, who quickly referred the case to trial. Many complaints languish for months or longer before any action is taken, so the swift action betrays the urgency of the desire to appease those that took offense. Youssef is due in court on Jan. 12. The case is the latest instance of ostensibly secular authorities embracing religious conservatism in Muslim-majority Egypt, where the military in 2013 — then led by current President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi — overthrew a freely elected but divisive Islamist president, Mohammed Morsi. Elected to office in 2014, el-Sissi has since overseen a crackdown that saw thousands of Islamists and many secular, pro-democracy activists imprisoned, and reversed gains won by a popular 2011 uprising that toppled the 29-year rule of autocrat Hosni Mubarak. But while el-Sissi's government embraces an almost obsessive opposition to political Islam, it has shown a large degree of tolerance toward ultraconservative Muslims. The Salafis, as they are known, have for decades worked quietly toward the gradual, non-violent transformation of Egypt into a society that observes the purist rules of Islam's early 7th century days. El-Sissi is known to be an observing Muslim who consistently invokes God in speeches but has regularly called on the country's top clerics to revise Islam's discourse in a bid to remove literature inspiring hatred or violence. In a TV interview before his election in June 2014, el-Sissi said: ""I will be responsible for (the nation's) values, ethics, principles and religion."" Egypt's Actors Guild, meanwhile, said in a statement that it intended to investigate and discipline actors who wore ""inappropriate"" attire during the opening and closing ceremonies of the weeklong film festival, arguing that they clashed with ""traditions, values and ethics of the society."" ""Although we absolutely believe in personal freedom of artists, we appeal to everyone to shoulder their responsibilities toward the fans who appreciate their art and view them as role models,"" said the statement. ""That should compel them to exercise a minimum level of commitment to society's public values."" Youssef's dress and news of her impending trial have dominated on social media over the weekend, made the front page Sunday of several newspapers and became the topic of several op-eds. While some on social media invoked religion to denounce the actress' ""immodesty,"" others criticized the judicial system for what they saw as bowing to conservatives, noting the lack of progress in redressing what they considered some of society's more pressing chronic ills, such as homelessness, corruption and sexual harassment of women. ""A nation is jolted by a revealing dress at a festival but is not enraged by a million children sleeping rough and scavenging in trash bins for food,"" tweeted columnist Khaled Montaser. Emad Hussein, editor of the independent and respected daily Al-Shorouk, said Youssef had every right, in theory, to wear whatever dress she chose, but that her ""grave mistake"" was that it ""looked more like a swimsuit."" ""There is a law that prohibits offending the public but, more importantly, there are societal values that need to be respected,"" he wrote Sunday."	nonTerrorism	Religion
"Mike Huckabee: President Trump, Asia Bibi is a Christian under threat of death in Pakistan -- please help her"	" It’s been almost a month since Asia Bibi, a Pakistani Christian who spent eight years on death row after being convicted of blasphemy, had her conviction overturned by Pakistan’s Supreme Court. But her life is in just as much danger now as when she faced the death penalty because of her Christian faith. Since her acquittal on October 31, Islamic leaders within the country have loudly rejected the Court’s ruling. Enormous and angry protests have wracked the country. There have been calls for her to be assassinated, as well as her family and the three judges who ruled in her favor. In response to death threats, her lawyer fled Pakistan and is seeking asylum in the Netherlands. There are reports that Islamic hardliners are going house to house, hunting her and her family down to kill them. Thankfully, Bibi is being kept in protective custody by the Pakistani government. However, the government has said that they will not stand in the way of Islamic hardliners who are seeking a review of her case. If this happens, she could be prohibited from leaving Pakistan — ranked 5th in the world for extreme religious persecution. Being forced to stay in the country would mean almost certain death. Asia Bibi’s husband has pleaded for asylum in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. The UK has denied his request. Canada is in talks with Pakistan regarding a potential offer of asylum, but no official agreement has been made. The United States has not yet offered asylum to Asia Bibi and her family. Christians prayed and advocated for Asia Bibi when she was arrested and charges of blasphemy were levied against her. We prayed during her imprisonment. We prayed during her trial. And we must be faithful to pray now that now her freedom and very life are again threatened. The truth of 1 Corinthians 12:26 starkly reminds us that all Christian brothers and sisters are united by Christ — “if one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.” Therefore it is vital that Christians continue to pray for Asia Bibi. Pray for her safety, that Pakistan will not block her from leaving the country and that she will be offered asylum. But, Christians must also speak up. President Trump and his administration have been stalwart and vocal champions for religious freedom across the globe. And in Asia Bibi’s case, urgent action is needed RIGHT NOW. Join me and raise your voice in support of Asia Bibi. Use this tool from My Faith Votes, for which I serve as honorary national chairman, to send an email to President Trump, your representative in Congress and Secretary of State Pompeo, and urge them to swiftly offer Asia Bibi and her family asylum. No person of any faith should ever fear for their life because of sincerely held beliefs. This principle has been cherished throughout America’s history, but we must remain steadfast to fight for this freedom here at home and around the world or else it will vanish."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Pope says he's worried about homosexuality in the priesthood	"Pope Francis has been quoted in a soon-to-be published book as saying that having gays in the clergy ""is something that worries me"" and remarking that some societies are considering homosexuality a ""fashionable"" lifestyle. Italian daily Corriere della Sera's website Saturday ran excerpts of the book in the form of an interview that Francis gave about religious vocations. Francis was quoted as describing homosexuality within the walls of seminaries, convents and other religious places where clergy live as ""a very serious question."" ""In our societies, it even seems homosexuality is fashionable. And this mentality, in some way, also influences the life of the church,"" Francis was quoted as telling his interviewer, a Spanish-born missionary priest, Fernando Prado. The book, based on four hours of conversations the two had in August at the Vatican, will be published in 10 languages next week. Its Spanish title is ""La Fuerza de la vocacion,"" (""The Strength of Vocation""). Francis reiterated past Vatican pronouncements about the attention that must be given to selecting men for admission to seminaries, saying ""we must very much take care of human and sentimental maturity"" when training future priests. Separately, the Italian news agency ANSA quoted Francis in the book as commenting on a clergyman who had told him that having gays in Catholic religious housing ""isn't so grave"" because it's ""only an expression of affection."" That reasoning ""is in error,"" Francis said. ""In consecrated life and priestly life, there is no place for this kind of affection."" He said candidates with ""neuroses or strong unbalances"" should not be accepted ""to the priesthood nor to (other forms of) consecrated life."" Still, Francis, as he has in the past, stressed that gay Catholics contribute to the life of the church. He said the church must always remember that ""they are persons who will live in the service of the church, of the Christian community, of the people of God. Let's never forget this perspective."" Francis in his papacy has sought to stress that while obeying church teachings, the faithful must also be compassionate and open to others with different views. Catholic teaching considers homosexual activity sinful, and that everyone, except married heterosexual couples, should abstain from sex."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Dutch church holds 24/7 service to shield asylum-seekers	"For more than a month, a rotating roster of preachers has been leading a non-stop, round-the-clock service at a small Protestant chapel in The Hague in an attempt to shield a family of Armenian asylum-seekers from deportation. Under a centuries-old tradition, authorities in the Netherlands don't enter a church while a service is underway. That means that for now the Tamrazyan family — parents, their two daughters and son — are safe from Dutch immigration authorities who want to send them back to Armenia. ""There was only one thing you could do and that was starting a church service to save the life of this family, but also call attention for the fate of so many children in similar circumstances,"" Theo Hettema, chair of the General Council of the Protestant Church of The Hague, said Friday. ""It's heartbreaking. We had compassion and we had good reasons and we thought it was the mission of our church to act like this."" The church service shines a light on a problem facing authorities in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe: what to do with families who have been fighting legal battles for asylum for so long that their children have become deeply integrated into society, going to school, learning the language and making friends. On a cold winter's Friday, visitors come and go at the church, ringing the bell on a door that in normal circumstances is open to all. A sign on the door says it is closed ""due to the special circumstances."" The visits of supporters underscore a continuing groundswell of sympathy for asylum seekers in parts of a Dutch society that once was known for its welcoming attitude, but has drifted to the right in recent years. One visitor, 74-year-old Bart ten Broek, said he was proud of the church's action, while lamenting the need for it. ""I love this country with the tradition of tolerance, respect for the other,"" he said. ""But you see there is a change and therefore I am here, too, to show our attitude. We have to be hosts."" The Tamrazyan family has been living in the Netherlands for nearly nine years, as their asylum application and various appeals proceeded slowly through the courts. Now the Council of State, the country's highest administrative court, has ruled they must return to their home country, which is considered safe by the Dutch government. The Associated Press was not given access to the family, and details on their asylum claim were not immediately clear. Over the years, sisters Hayarpi, 21, and Warduhi, 19, and their 15-year-old brother Seyran have laid down roots, attended school and made friends. While the round-the-clock service continues, the family sometimes listens to the sermon, cooks or receives visits from friends. ""It's very stressful for them,"" Hettema said. ""Sometimes they are sad and nervous and sometimes they are hopeful and give us hope in return."" Martine Goeman, a lawyer with the Dutch branch of non-government group Defense For Children, said there are about 400 children in a similar position in the Netherlands. The Dutch government introduced a rule in 2013, known by many as a ""children's pardon,"" that under special circumstances grants asylum to children who have been in the country for more than five years while their asylum application is processed, but Goeman says appeals for such a pardon are rarely honored. ""The eligibility criteria are so strict that almost nobody is granted one,"" she said. ""So actually it is a dead letter. That is a shame, because a children's pardon sounds like something great for children, but in practice it is meaningless."" The Dutch justice ministry declined to comment on the family's case. In a written response, the ministry said the current four-party coalition led by Prime Minister Mark Rutte had decided not to broaden the children's pardon when it took office. In exceptional cases, the justice minister can use discretionary powers to grant asylum. ""These are cases involving unforeseen circumstances that were not taken into account when the policy and rules were established,"" according to the ministry statement. ""Factors such as a long period of residence in the Netherlands and enrolment in education in the Netherlands are not sufficiently exceptional circumstances."" Goeman said she hopes the government will allow the children to stay. ""This is not going to blow over,"" she said. ""The opposition in society is only getting stronger."" Hettema said that after initially using local preachers to deliver the service, the church has now reached out to others and has received offers of help from some 500 people from different churches as far away as Belgium. That support gives the locals strength to carry on, hoping that they can open talks with lawmakers and the government about the family's plight. ""As long as it's useful to contribute to the dialogue, we will continue with the church service,"" Hettema said."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Pakistani PM inaugurates pilgrim border crossing with India	"Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan attended Wednesday the groundbreaking ceremony for the first visa-free border crossing with India, a corridor that will allow Sikh pilgrims to easily visit their shrines on each side of the border. The crossing — known as the Kartarpur corridor — is a rare sign of cooperation between the two nuclear-armed rival countries. Khan used the occasion to again call on India to work together to overcome bitterness of the past, resolve issues through dialogue to eliminate poverty in both nations. The crossing was a Khan initiative and India last week gave the green light for the construction to begin. Instead of visas, the pilgrims will be given special permits to access their shrines — the Dera Baba Nanak in India's Punjab province, and the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Pakistan's Narowal border district in its own Punjab province. Wednesday's ceremony was attended by hundreds of Sikh pilgrims as well as two lawmakers from India and officials from both countries. Pakistani army chief Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa called the laying of the foundation for the crossing a ""step toward peace, which our region needs."" Citing examples of Germany and France after World War II, Khan said that if two European neighbors can live peacefully, why not India and Pakistan, which have fought two out of three wars between them over the contested region of Kashmir. ""Both Pakistan and India are nuclear powers, so war is no option as that will be a suicide. Then what else is the option except dialogue to resolve all issues,"" said Khan, who was a world-famous cricket player before he turned to politics. ""If there is a will on both sides, the issue of Kashmir could also be resolved."" India's own cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu said at the ceremony that he is grateful to Khan and the government in New Delhi for taking ""this positive step"" that will help Sikhs on both sides of the border reach their shrines. Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi cited the Sikh religion's founder, Guru Nanak, for his message of love and peace. ""We are laying the foundation of the Kartarpur corridor"" with this same message, he said. Qureshi said the Kartarpur corridor will open next November, on the 550th anniversary of Guru Nanak's birth and will include a stretch of road 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) long, a bridge on a river and a border complex with all facilities necessary for pilgrims. This story has been corrected to show the spelling of the corridor's name is Kartarpur."	nonTerrorism	Religion
"Miss Moscow 2015 converts to Islam, marries King of Malaysia"	"A former Miss Moscow has become the new ""Queen of Malaysia"" after she converted to Islam and married the country's King Muhammad V of Kelantan. Oksana Voevodina, 25, is 24 years younger than her new husband who has been on the throne since 2016. The 49-year-old king was dressed in Malaysian national dress and the bride wore a white wedding gown. The reception was alcohol-free and all food was halal. Before becoming a royal bride she said: ""When I was at school I was a kind of bandit. I liked some skaters, bikes, BMX, guys who took part in competitions."" But she later commented: ""I think that the man must be the head of the family and of course shall not earn less than a woman."" Little is known about Voevodina apart from her victory in the Miss Moscow contest three years ago when her vital statistics were given as 33-23-35. It is not known how the pair met and it is unclear whether she has been married before. Doctor’s daughter Voevodina was 22 in 2015 when she won the title of Miss Moscow. Her dad Andrey Gorbatenko is an orthopedic surgeon from Rostov-on-Don believed to be in his late 50s. He is seen hugging her in a picture taken on a boat near the Kremlin as she wears her beauty crown. She claimed she only realized the power of her looks when she went to university. Voevodina said: ""I was the tallest in my class (at school) and the most slim, and I was a bit worried about that. ""Only when I was at university, did I realize that this was my strong side. ""Young guys started to pay attention and I realized that they looked at me more often than at fat and not very tall girls."" Her mother was a beauty contestant in a local contest in Penza in the early 1990s soon after the collapse of the USSR. The Malaysian head of state was educated at Oakham School in Rutland, England, and St. Cross College, Oxford University. Later he attended the European Business School in London. His heir is currently his younger brother Tengku Muhammad Faiz Petra. This article originally appeared in The Sun."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Has Bible-carrying El Chapo really found God? Skeptics aren't buying it	"Accused Sinaloa Cartel drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman is apparently playing the God card and is exercising his Catholic faith during his trial - though not everyone is buying it. According to an official source connected to the case, the drug kingpin has perhaps conveniently “found Jesus” in the almost two years since he was extradited from Mexico to the United States. The source said Chapo requested a Spanish-language Bible when he was brought to the U.S., after informing authorities of his faith and filling out the appropriate legal paperwork with the U.S Marshals. He is said to carry the Bible everywhere – including every time he leaves his cell. And it apparently “sits in his suit pocket during court,” a source said. “It is small like the size of an iPhone or wallet. It’s like a travel edition,” said the law enforcement source, who was not authorized to speak on the record. “I don’t think he’s reading any of it. He carries it like it’s a symbolic peacemaker. I haven’t seen him pray at all.” Beyond his Bible, Guzman’s only reading material is in the form of legal paperwork. He is allowed absolutely no computer access, and up until the trial which began earlier this month, spend around 23 hours a day in solitary confinement. “It seems like Chapo is trying to find religion as he sits in solitary confinement in prison,” said Derek Maltz, former Special Agent in Charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Special Operations Division in New York. Maltz and others have pointed out Guzman and his Sinaloa cartel were not particularly known to be as faith-driven as other rival cartels in Mexico. But in a region that is overwhelmingly Catholic, church-cartels relationships have a somewhat complicated history. On the one hand, professing faith has been a popular tack with drug runners. A few years before being killed in 2014 shootout, Guzman’s competing drug gang chief – Nazario Moreno Gonzalez, who first headed the La Familia drug syndicate before leading the Knights Templar Cartel – self-published his own 104-page booklet “Thoughts.” The faith-driven publication, brimming with crosses and images of Jesus, offered impassioned passage of “Christian living” advice - which included love and respect for others Cartel underlings were reportedly made to take up Bible study and pray the rosary - even if the next orders were to slaughter civilians or manufacture methamphetamine for the black market. And while there is no evidence the Vatican in any way condoned or enabled suspicious dealings with the cartels, critics have accused the Catholic Church of speaking out harshly against the cartels in public, while quietly accepting “narco alms” - otherwise characterized as dirty money allegedly donated by cartel leaders to finance a variety of reconstruction and charity projects. In 2009, a church in a poor neighborhood of the Mexican city of Pachuca unveiled a 65-foot-high metal cross. While celebrated by some, an accompanying plaque expressed gratitude to the since-killed top brass of the Zetas Cartel, Heriberto “The Executioner” Lazcano, as the sole benefactor for the project. One U.S law enforcement official explained that devout cartel leaders have since taken to funneling money to the church through “middlemen” - leaving the church unaware of the real source of the donations. “Religiosity is often employed in the service of deeper, more unconscious motivations. Some cartel members may speak in the name of religion in an effort to assuage a sense of personal guilt for their criminal actions,” explained New York clinical psychologist, Dr. Norman Fried. “Psychiatric events such as mania or hypomania are often correlated with strong religious statements. The connection to religion is often intense, unwavering and all-consuming. Then the religiosity wanes, and the individual seems less interested in God.” CHAPO'S BEAUTY QUEEN WIFE LIVING LAVISHLY - AWAY FROM THE COURTROOM MANIPULATION, FEAR, SNITCHES, AND A NEW CELL: BEHIND THE SCENES AS EL CHAPO GOES TO TRIAL But concerns are also growing for the safety of church leaders in the face of intimidation and warnings by those very same cartels. “Christian leaders are under threat from drug cartels in Mexico. Cartels target those who speak out against the scourge of drugs on their communities, which puts priests and pastors in their bullseye,” said David Curry, President and CEO of Open Doors USA, a Christian watchdog group. Curry noted the Vatican has indeed recognized the violence of persecution of Christians in Mexico but insisted the Mexican government can still “do more to protect easy targets like churches and priests in communities where the cartels are working and threatening the clergy.” In an official visit to Mexico in early 2016, Pope Francis – the first to hail from Latin America – encouraged Mexicans to thwart the lure of illicit drugs and cash. Yet despite an initial sense of hope, observers said, standing up to the violence remains very dangerous. Some religious leaders have been forced to take desperate measures for their survival. Catholic priest Gregorio “Father Goyo” Lopez has taken to wearing a bulletproof vest from his pulpit in the southwestern state of Michoacán, after repeated death threats. “I saw how they were killing my friends, my brothers, my sheep, as the pastor I have an obligation for speaking out,” Lopez told TIME. “If a dog bites your children, and you do nothing, then you are worse than the dog.” Last year, reports surfaced that Mexican cartels had taken up forcibly “taxing” churches in their areas. While the practice was deemed to be “very common,” most cases are believed to go unreported. More than 30 church leaders have been slain in Mexico in the past decade, as documented by the Centro Catolico Multimedial – directly or indirectly caught in the crossfire. In 1993, the Church’s top official, Cardinal Juan Posadas Ocampo, was shot dead at the airport in Guadalajara, Mexico. “The Roman Catholic Church has expressed concern that violence and corruption have diminished the number of parishioners in the past decades, although Mexican drug cartels have also been increasing their donations to various Mexican Catholic dioceses,” explained J.T. Patten, a former government intelligence operative. “In hearts and minds campaigns for the power to rule people, it is less about religion and more about who can control the message to the masses.” As for Chapo, he ""always saw himself as some kind of Robin Hood,” observed one Mexican law enforcement source. “It is part of the branding.” That might explain the presence of a six-inch figurine of Mexico's ""narco-saint"" Jesus Malverde, a popular figure with those in the drug trade, in the conference rooms for Guzman's defense team at the Brooklyn courthouse. The “generous bandit” hailed from Sinaloa in the 19th Century, and was said to have stolen from the rich to give to the poor. ""Most cartel leaders don't believe that what they are doing is wrong. Many can feel like they are just doing what they need to in order to feed their families or make a living; considering themselves ‘family men’,” added Kati Morton, a California-based licensed therapist. “In a way, they compartmentalize their life, and therefore still believe that religion and God are important and necessary. If they ever do feel guilty or like they have done wrong, if they ask God for forgiveness, they can let go of their guilt and be okay.” The Vatican and Guzman’s lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But for many U.S. law enforcement professionals, such proclamations of faith when facing the fate of the judicial system is a tried and true hat trick pulled by everyone from mobsters to gangsters to serial killers to drug lords. “I wouldn't know what's in anyone's heart - only they and God know that. But I highly doubt that the likes of Chapo and any money they gave to the Church was not achieved by killing a few hundred people and running drugs,” added Craig Caine, retired Inspector United States Marshal's Service, Eastern District of New York and the New York and New Jersey Regional Fugitive Task Force. “In other words, they are full of sh*t. This is part of the business. That’s it.”"	nonTerrorism	Religion
"Afghan officials: Taliban attacks kill 20 police, 10 troops"	"A Taliban ambush of a police convoy in western Afghanistan killed 20 policemen while 10 troops died in an insurgent attack on an army checkpoint in the north, Afghan officials said Monday as minority Shiites took to the streets in Kabul for the second day to protest the arrest of local militia commander. During the demonstrations in the Afghan capital, the protesters opened fire at the police, wounding four policemen. Deputy interior minister Gen. Akhtar Mohammad Ibrahimi said 44 policemen were also injured when protesters hurled stones and other hard objects at them. The Taliban ambush took place in western Farah province on Sunday afternoon. Along with 20 policemen killed, four were wounded, including the deputy provincial police chief, said Dadullah Qaneh, a member of the provincial council. The convoy was on its way to the district of Lash wa Juwayn to introduce newly appointed district police chief when it came under attack, said another council member, Abdul Samad Salehi. The newly appointed chief was also killed, said Qaneh. In northern Faryab province, the Taliban attacked an army check point in Qaisar district, killing 10 troops, said Mohammad Tahir Rahmani, head of the provincial council. Three soldiers were wounded while the fate of five others was unknown. The Taliban, who in recent years have taken over nearly half of Afghanistan, claimed responsibility for the Farah attack, the latest in a series of brutal, near-daily Taliban assaults on Afghan military and security forces throughout the country. The insurgents made no statement on the Faryab assault. The Taliban view the U.S.-backed government in Kabul as a dysfunctional Western puppet and have refused repeated offers to negotiate with it. The protesters in western Kabul were rallying to denounce the arrest of Abdul Ghani Alipoor, a Shiite militia leader in western Ghor province. The Afghan intelligence service accuses Alipoor of leading an illegal armed group that is behind extortion and other mafia-like behavior in the region. On Sunday, hundreds clashed with police during a similar Shiite protest in Kabul. In that demonstration, three policemen were shot and wounded and 20 were injured by stones thrown by protesters who also torched two police checkpoints. Beside Kabul, there were also protests on Monday in northern Balkh and central Bamyan provinces but no reports of violence there. ""I can hear sporadic sound of shooting form the area,"" said lawmaker Nasrullah Sadeqizada of Monday's protest in Kabul. The member of parliament lives near the area and spoke to The Associated Press over the phone. Mahobullah, a resident form the area who uses only one name, said hundreds of protesters were carrying posters of Alipoor, shouting: ""Alipoor is innocent"" and demanding that he be set free. During a previous attempt to arrest Alipoor, in June, security forces in Ghor clashed with his followers, leading to the deaths of seven civilians and four policemen."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Pakistan arrests 1100 supporters of detained cleric	"Police in an ongoing crackdown arrested some 1100 supporters of a detained radical Islamic cleric, who disrupted daily life with nationwide rallies following the acquittal of a Christian woman sentenced to death for blasphemy, officials said Saturday. Senior police officer Tahir Mahmood said that supporters of the Tehreek-e-Labbaik party were picked up in sweeps across the country, mainly in Punjab province, following the arrest of its leader, Khadim Hussain Rizvi. Mahmood said police teams raided Labbaik party seminaries, the homes of party leaders and supporters and hiding places to net them. He said police also arrested scores of Rizvi's supporters as they took to streets to protest his overnight arrest. He said most of the arrested men were sent to prison for one month. He added that those charged with violence and arson in their protests over Asia Bibi's acquittal would be dealt with according to relevant laws. Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said the current crackdown on Labbaik party supporters has nothing to do with Asia Bibi's case. He said the arrests are being made to contain those exploiting the situation in the name of religion to gain political strength. Rizvi's supporters held violent rallies against the Supreme Court's Oct. 31 acquittal of Bibi. Rizvi has called for more protests on Sunday in the capital, Islamabad. Pre-empting the possible protest, police in the capital have set up security posts near a vital intersection that connects the capital with the garrison city of Rawalpindi. Rizvi and his supporters earlier this year blocked that intersection for 20 days protesting the change of a religious reference in a parliamentary document. That protest led to the resignation of the law minister of previous government. Pakistan's hard-line Islamists have threatened to kill anyone who insults Islam or speaks out against the country's blasphemy laws. Associated Press writer Zarar Khan in Islamabad contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Global Catholic nuns urge reporting of sex abuse to police	"The Catholic Church's global organization of nuns has denounced the ""culture of silence and secrecy"" surrounding sexual abuse in the church and is urging sisters who have been abused to report the crimes to police and their superiors. The International Union of Superiors General, which represents more than 500,000 sisters worldwide, vowed to help nuns who have been abused to find the courage to report it, and pledged to help victims heal and seek justice. The statement was the first from the Rome-based UISG since the abuse scandal erupted anew this year and as the sexual abuse of adult nuns by priests and bishops has also come to the fore. The Associated Press reported earlier this year that the Vatican has known for decades about the problem of priests preying on nuns, but has done next to nothing to stop it. In the statement Friday, the UISG didn't specify clergy as the aggressors. While such abuse is well known in parts of Africa, and an Indian case of the alleged rape of a nun by a bishop is currently making headlines, there have also been cases of sexual abuse committed by women against other nuns within congregations. The UISG statement was broad, condemning what it called the ""pattern of abuse that is prevalent within the church and society today,"" citing sexual, verbal and emotional abuse as types of mistreatment that demeans the dignity of its victims. ""We condemn those who support the culture of silence and secrecy, often under the guise of 'protection' of an institution's reputation or naming it 'part of one's culture,'"" the group said. ""We advocate for transparent civil and criminal reporting of abuse whether within religious congregations, at the parish or diocesan levels, or in any public arena,"" the statement said. An AP investigation found that cases of priest abusing nuns have emerged in Europe, Africa, South America and Asia, underscoring how sisters' second class status in the church has contributed to a power imbalance where women can be mistreated with near impunity. While some nuns are finding their voices, buoyed by the #MeToo movement, many victims remain reluctant to come forward. Experts told AP sisters have a well-founded fear they won't be believed and will instead be painted as the seducer who corrupted the priest. Often the sister who denounces abuse by a priest is punished, including with expulsion from her congregation, while the priest's vocation is preserved at all cost. The Vatican has known for years about the problem in Africa after a series of major studies were commissioned in the 1990s. Religious sisters reported that African nuns were being particularly targeted by priests seeking to avoid HIV transmission from prostitutes or other women."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Yemeni officials: UN envoy in front-line city of Hodeida	"The U.N. special envoy to Yemen visited on Friday the Red Sea port city of Hodeida in efforts to halt hostilities between a Saudi-led coalition and Yemen's Shiite rebels there and lay the groundwork for restarting peace talks, officials said. Martin Griffiths met with several rebel officials during his short visit to Hodeida, a vital access point for aid to Yemen' population. The coalition backing Yemen's internationally recognized government has been pushing to retake the city from the rebels since the summer. Its offensive has drawn wide criticism from international aid groups who fear a protracted fight could force a shutdown of the port and potentially tip millions into starvation. Griffiths' visit comes amid mounting international pressure to end the war that has resulted in what the U.N. says is the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The U.N. envoy, who was accompanied by U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator Lise Grande and the WFP chief for Yemen, Stephen Anderson, concluded the visit in a few hours before heading back to the rebel-held capital, Sanaa, the officials said. The spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to brief reporters. Talks to end Yemen's three-year war pitting the Saudi-led coalition and rival Iran-aligned rebels are expected in December in Sweden. Griffiths has said both sides have agreed to attend peace talks. His latest effort to revive peace talks in September fell through after the Houthis didn't attend. Yemen's ruinous civil war has killed over 10,000 people, badly damaging Yemen's infrastructure and crippling its health system. International aid group Save The Children has said that an estimated 85,000 Yemeni children under the age of 5 may have died of hunger and disease since the outbreak of the war in 2015. This story has been corrected to restore a dropped word in envoy Griffiths' name."	nonTerrorism	Religion
"Pope taps experts, women for group to prepare abuse summit"	"Pope Francis named the Vatican's top sex abuse investigator and a close U.S. ally to an organizing committee for a February abuse prevention summit that has grown even more high stakes after the Holy See blocked U.S. bishops from taking action to address the scandal. Abuse survivors and women working at the Vatican will also contribute to the preparatory committee. Notably absent from the lineup announced Friday was Boston Cardinal Sean O'Malley, who heads the pope's sex abuse advisory commission, though one of his members, the Rev. Hans Zollner, is the point-person for the group. In addition to Zollner, the committee includes Maltese Archbishop Charles Scicluna, for a decade the Vatican's sex crimes prosecutor, Francis appointee Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich and Indian Cardinal Oswald Gracias, a member of Francis' key cardinal adviser group. Francis summoned leaders of the world's 130 bishops' conferences to the Vatican Feb. 21-24 after the abuse scandal erupted again in his native South America and the U.S. and he himself botched the case of a Chilean bishop implicated in cover-up. The stakes of the meeting grew exponentially after the Vatican told U.S. bishops earlier this month not to vote on proposed new measures to investigate sexual misconduct or cover-up within their ranks. The Vatican still hasn't explained why it blocked the vote on a U.S. code of conduct for bishops and a lay-led board to investigate them. The head of the U.S. bishops conference, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, said the Holy See wanted to delay any vote until after the February global summit. However, it is unlikely that such a diverse group of churchmen, some representing national churches that continue to deny or downplay the scandal, will over the course of four days come up with any universal proposals that come close to the accountability norms that U.S. bishops were seeking. Cupich has said he was disappointed by the Vatican's decision, but at the time of the U.S. bishops' meeting, he proposed they go ahead and debate the measures and even came up with a revised proposal himself. ""Pope Francis is calling for radical reform in the life of the church, for he understands that this crisis is about the abuse of power and a culture of protection and privilege, which have created a climate of secrecy, without accountability for misdeeds,"" he wrote in a blog post Thursday. ""All of that has to end."" Zollner, who heads a safeguarding institute of study at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, acknowledged that the expectations were high going into the meeting. ""And it's understandable that they are high, given the gravity of the scandal that has shocked and hurt so many people, believers and not, in so many countries,"" he told Vatican Media. Vatican spokesman Greg Burke said Francis' decision to host the meeting at all showed he considered protection of minors a ""fundamental priority for the church."" The involvement of lay experts in the preparatory work, Burke said, ""can help address especially what needs to be done to ensure transparency and accountability,"" he said."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Afghan official: Blast at army base mosque kills 9 soldiers	"An explosion ripped through a mosque inside an Afghan army base in the country's volatile eastern Khost province as Friday prayers were drawing to a close, killing nine soldiers and wounding 22s, the military said. Afghan officials indicated the blast may have been set off by a suicide bomber or a remotely detonated bomb but nothing was officially confirmed and details were sketchy. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the explosion. It was the latest in a relentless, near-daily onslaughts in Afghanistan, where the Taliban regularly target Afghan military and police forces throughout the country. ""There were soldiers lying everywhere and the smoke was so thick, it was difficult to see,"" said Abdullah, a soldier who like most Afghans uses only one name. He spoke to The Associated Press over the phone from the base. The dead and wounded were rushed to a clinic within the army base, while the more seriously wounded were taken to a nearby hospital. The explosion came just days after a suicide bomber killed 55 religious scholars gathered in the Afghan capital, Kabul, to celebrate the holiday marking the birth of Islam's Prophet Muhammad. The Taliban denied involvement in that bombing, which also wounded 94 people. After 17 years and billions of dollars spent training and arming Afghanistan's military, it is struggling against an emboldened Taliban insurgency that holds sway in nearly half of the country. As well as the Taliban, Afghan troops are also battling an audacious Islamic State affiliate which has been particularly brutal in its attacks against Afghanistan's minority Shiites. Elsewhere in Afghanistan on Friday, hundreds of protesters blocked roads in northern Parwan province to denounce the death of three people who they say were civilians, killed in an operation against the Taliban earlier on Friday. The protesters said the operation by Afghan special forces involved a NATO airstrike in the Jebul Siraj district that killed the three. However, NATO spokeswoman U.S. Sgt. 1st Class Debra Richardson said no NATO or American activity took place in Parwan in the past three days. The provincial governor's spokewoman, Wahida Sakhar, said Parwan officials were negotiating with the protesters and promised an investigation into the incident. Afghan special forces called in a NATO airstrike during an operation Wednesday against the Taliban in eastern Logar province. Ten people died but it's unclear how many were civilians."	nonTerrorism	Religion
"Muslim preachers help Kosovo women learn, win their rights"	"There's a widespread tradition among many Muslims that it's better for women to pray at home than in the mosque. But in Kosovo, an old Ottoman-era tradition is bucking that trend, with religious authorities seeking to establish the training of women as spiritual teachers in mosques. Each day, scores of women gather around Agime Sogojeva, a spiritual teacher known as a mualime, in the Haxhi Veseli mosque in Kosovo's northern town of Mitrovica. They discuss the Quran, their rights as women and daily practices, in a scene unthinkable as little as a decade ago. Sogojeva is one of some 100 female theologians aiming to revive Muslim traditions in Europe's newest country. They teach at three Muslim high schools, at Muslim centers, or they work voluntarily. The move to establish the religious training of women in mosques — where women are allocated places in a separate room from the men — is seen by some as a way to make Kosovo's approach to Islam more gender-balanced at a time when many in the West view Islam as oppressive toward women. Although in much of the Muslim world women teach other women, it is more common for that to occur at home or in event halls rather than in the mosques themselves. In some very conservative Islamic societies, women are generally distanced from mosques for social rather than religious reasons. In Kosovo, there has been a significant increase in the number of women attending mosques in the past 20 years, said Besa Ismaili, a 43-year-old professor of English at the Faculty of Islamic Studies in Pristina. ""The women were not only denied access, but their contribution was not recognized sufficiently,"" she said. ""We try to break up those stereotypes, those misconceptions."" Kosovo has a strongly patriarchal society but also a long secular tradition, with religious identity significantly weakened during decades of communist rule. Most of its ethnic Albanian majority population is Muslim, but religious expression was generally lax even after the fall of communism in the late 1980s. The country declared independence from Serbia in 2008, nearly a decade after a 1998-1999 war against Yugoslav forces by ethnic Albanian fighters. Recently, however, it has seen a rise of religiously-inspired violent extremism, with more than 300 Kosovo citizens joining the Islamic State group as foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria since 2012. A quarter of those were women and children, often forced to follow their husbands into the war zone. About 180 Kosovo citizens are still active with extremist groups in Syria and Iraq, and the women are held in camps. But Kosovo authorities claim no citizen has joined a fundamentalist group over the past two years, a development partly attributed to the empowering of women through the creation of female Islamic teachers. ""Extreme nationalism becomes less present when Islam is explained to women,"" Ismaili says. Funding for about a dozen of the female theologians comes from Turkey's Directorate of Religious Affairs, or Diyanet, which assists the Islamic Community of Kosovo, or BIK, the country's executive for Muslims. These female preachers are active members in about 800 mosques countrywide, said Resul Rexhepi, BIK secretary general, modernizing women's life and increasing their role in society. ""Mualime are good for the whole society,"" he said. BIK officials claim that the introduction of the female Muslim preachers in the mosques has reduced sexual violence at home, assisted women who were raped during the war, helped mothers with their children's education and increased the participation of women in voting in elections. There are no official figures to support such claims. During the past decade or so some 1,100 girls have graduated from three Muslim high schools and 300 women from the Faculty of Islamic Studies. Enisa Bekteshi, a 21-year old student, says it is easier for a female teacher to explain ""some delicate issues a woman is reluctant to ask an imam, a man.""

S. Korea pastor gets 15-year jail term for raping followers	" A South Korean pastor was sentenced to 15 years in prison on Thursday for raping or sexually molesting eight female followers who believed he was God. The Seoul Central District Court said that Lee Jae-rock of the Seoul-based Manmin Central Church was convicted of abusing the women ""habitually"" for an extended period. A court statement said the victims had ""absolute belief in Lee's religious authority"" and thought they could go to heaven if they obeyed his order. The court said that Lee had denied the charges against him. Both Lee and prosecutors have one week to appeal. Some of the eight women gave their accounts about Lee's abuses in a series of programs by local JTBC television network in April. They described how Lee summoned each of them to his apartment at night and raped them by telling them they were improving their chances to go to heaven. Their names were not disclosed and faces obscured. ""(He) said he was a holy and righteous man and would choose me to go to the new Jerusalem,"" said one victim. Another victim told the network that Lee demanded she take contraceptives before coming to his house. A third victim said Lee instructed her to pay only in cash for the cab ride she took to get to his house, apparently out of concerns of leaving any credit-card records. ""(He said) other kids were taking pills before coming and I should too,"" the second woman said. ""(He said) heaven was a place where everyone was clean and didn't feel shame or lust even if they were naked."" Lee, reportedly 75, set up his church in Seoul's formerly blue-collar Guro neighborhood in 1982. It has more than 135,000 followers, according to the church's website, which is also filled with claims of Lee's miracle cures through prayer."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Australian PM accuses Muslim leaders of denying threat	"Australia's prime minister accused senior Muslim community leaders on Wednesday of ""continuing down a path of denial"" after they refused an invitation to a meeting to discuss the threat posed by Islamic extremists. Prime Minister Scott Morrison's tweeted response to the Islamic leaders' request for a postponement of Thursday's meeting adds to friction with the Muslim world sparked by his proposal last month to move the Australian embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Morrison has denied a widely held view that the Jerusalem proposal was aimed at domestic political gain amid a debate over levels of Muslim immigration. ""The meeting is going ahead with those who want to deal with this issue seriously rather than look the other way,"" Morrison said. ""Some have chosen to publicly boycott this meeting. Continuing down a path of denial only lets their communities down,"" he added. It was not clear who would attend the meeting representing Muslims, who account for 3 percent of the Australian population, which is majority Christian. Morrison called the meeting after a Muslim extremist fatally stabbed a man and injured two others in downtown Melbourne on Nov. 9 before police shot the assailant dead. Some Australian Muslims were critical when Morrison later said that ""radical, violent, extremist Islam"" posed the greatest threat to Australia's national security. They felt the wider Muslim community had been blamed when Morrison said Islamic leaders ""must be proactive, they must be alert and they must call this out."" Muslims Australia, a national umbrella group, said on Wednesday that Islamic state councils had called for the meeting to be postponed because it had been called in haste, no agenda had been provided and Morrison had failed to respond to concerns they raised in a Nov. 12 letter. Grand Mufti Mohamed Abdalla, Australia's most senior Muslim cleric, was among the religious leaders who signed a statement accusing government ministers of inferring that the Muslim community ""is collectively culpable for the criminal actions of individuals"" in comments that have ""alienated large segments of the Muslim community."" The statement was also signed by Ghaith Krayem, chief executive of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils, who told Australian Broadcasting Corp. on Wednesday that ""I would encourage the prime minister not to engage on serious matters on twitter."" ""We are genuinely committed to be engaged with government, but it has to be a genuine process,"" Krayem said. ""The causes of terrorism is a complex issue."" On Tuesday, three men were charged with planning an Islamic State group-inspired mass-casualty attack in Melbourne which would likely have happened over the busy Christmas period. Police said the plot had been thwarted with the arrests."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Cracks show in China's vision for model ethnic unity village	"In this corner of China's far west, rows of identical white concrete houses with red metal roofs rise abruptly above the sand dunes of the harsh Taklamakan Desert. A Chinese flag flutters above the settlement, and a billboard at the entrance says, ""Welcome to the Hotan Unity New Village."" This is a Communist Party showcase for its efforts to tame Xinjiang province, the heartland of China's often restive Uighur Muslim minority and an unforgiving terrain. The free or low-cost houses are assigned alternately to Uighurs and Han Chinese, who work side-by-side in greenhouses and send their children to school together. It is the future the party envisions for Xinjiang after a massive security crackdown that has sent by some estimates more than a million Muslims to internment camps, and many of their children to orphanages. But a closer look at what the party calls ""ethnic unity"" reveals what isn't there: mosques for Muslim worshippers, or traditional Uighur brick homes, often adorned with pointed arches and carved decorations. In their place are colorful murals of what authorities consider to be scenes of unity, such as a Uighur man and his family holding a Chinese flag. In the village's new public square, Uighur children banter with Han Chinese children in fluent Mandarin, the language of the Han majority, rather than in their native tongue. Young Uighur women wear Western clothing without the headscarves that are part of traditional Muslim dress. While these are voluntary settlements with economic benefits, experts and Uighur activists believe they are part of an aggressive government campaign to erode the identities of the Central Asian groups who called the region home long before waves of Han migrants arrived in recent decades. ""'Ethnic unity' is a euphemism for taming, breaking the Uighur people,"" says Joanne Smith Finley, an expert in Uighur identity at Newcastle University in the U.K. ""This is putting flowery bright wallpaper over a damp wall, a rotting wall."" Construction of the village began in 2014 with a planned investment of 1.7 billion yuan ($247 million). The goal was to build 5,000 homes and 10,000 greenhouses, according to local reports, to turn a large swath of desert into farmland and create a shared prosperity among Uighurs and Han Chinese. Around the same time, the Communist Party came forth with a new strategy focused on ethnic mingling. Subsequently, at least one county offered financial incentives for Uighur-Han intermarriages, while others have launched programs encouraging Uighur families to move into Han Chinese residential areas. China is building several such mixed settlements in Xinjiang. A similar village is under construction as a tourist attraction near Kuqa, around 600 kilometers (372 miles) from Hotan. A concrete yurt known as the ""solidarity farmhouse"" already has been completed, and a giant sculpture of a pomegranate is prominently placed at the center of the village to symbolize unity. In Hotan, there are signs that the government's experiment is making inroads. Uighur farmers toil alongside Han Chinese to farm crops in what was once barren desert land, and both groups live in modern houses equipped with gas, electricity and water. A billboard displays a picture of President Xi Jinping and a group of Uighur elders joining hands and, according to the caption, ""linking hearts."" Yet there are also signs of enduring mistrust. As elsewhere in Xinjiang, high walls around homes are topped with barbed wire, and police officers stand guard from behind fences at the entrance of the village. Adults don't mix socially — at night, a group of Han Chinese dance in the square while the Uighur residents chat among themselves on the sidelines. A Uighur farmer who moved to the village last September says authorities provided him with free housing and utilities, two greenhouses, a small orchard with grapevines and a barn with sheep, chickens, and pigeons. But the crackdown on Muslims in Xinjiang has made it risky for ordinary Muslims to discuss their religious practices, and when speaking to reporters in front of government observers, he insists he was never a Muslim. Another Uighur farmer in his early seventies, Muzitohtahon, says he is no longer a Muslim. Uighur and Han villagers do seem united by at least one factor — their desire to escape poverty. Rural areas in Xinjiang, including Hotan, rank among the poorest in China, with many families lacking even the most basic utilities and food. The financial incentives are also a key draw for Han Chinese from other impoverished regions of China. Last May, 58-year-old Xiao Erying, who is Han Chinese, moved to this village from her hometown in the southern province of Hunan, over 4,000 kilometers away. ""It is better than our hometown,"" she says, as she rakes sheep, chicken and cow manure inside her greenhouse. For 60,000 yuan ($8,700), her family bought a two-bedroom home with a small orchard and two greenhouses. The two grandchildren she lives with are given free tuition, school lunches, and even a free set of clothes. Xiao admits she doesn't speak Uighur and cannot communicate with her Uighur neighbors, but she says the layout encourages interaction. In a greenhouse a few dozen meters away, Uighur Abudu Mijiti has just begun planting chili with his wife. He moved to the village three years ago to make a more stable living. Two of his three children go to the local school and are fluent in Chinese, he says, as a government minder looks on. ""For us, it's good, it helps learning our national language,"" he says. ""And because our next-door neighbor is Chinese, as we go in and out, it helps improve ethnic unity."" On the surface, the picture presented at the Hotan Unity New Village reflects the government's vision of an ""idealized place,"" says David O'Brien, an expert at the University of Nottingham. ""Every single part of it is the official narrative,"" O'Brien says. ""The narrative is, water will flow to the desert. The narrative is, if you come here great opportunity awaits you. The narrative that people will be secular, they will learn Mandarin."" Yet the settlement remains only partly inhabited. The city says there are 534 households in the compound, but most of the houses are empty. A drive through reveals rows of empty greenhouses and house after house with a sign that says ""sealed off"" patched onto padlocked or chained gates. Under the sweltering desert sun, one Han Chinese farmer tending to her plot of Chinese chives complains that water is scarce and her previous batch of chives had to be thrown out. Even when the crops work out, the chives sell for less than one yuan (14 cents) per kilogram. ""Not even enough for food,"" she grumbles. ""You cannot feed yourself just working on greenhouses."" In the absence of government minders, the woman goes on. ""Ordinary people are not able to eat meat. The officials can, but not the ordinary people,"" says the woman, who declines to give her name out of fear of retaliation. As dusk approaches and temperatures fall, residents slowly make their way out onto the streets to enjoy the evening breeze. On the Uighur side of the street, a young Uighur woman rests on an electric bike after a day's work, looking at her cell phone. Asked what she thinks of unity, she looks up. ""Unity?"" she asks. Silently and slowly, she shakes her head, and returns to her phone."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Yemeni rebels say they will halt rocket fire at Saudi Arabia	"A senior leader of Yemen's Shiite rebels said on Monday that the group will halt rocket fire into Saudi Arabia for the sake of peace efforts, answering a key Saudi demand in the first public sign of hope for the latest push to stop the bloodshed and civilian suffering in the Arab world's poorest country. For the past three years, a U.S.-backed, Saudi-led coalition has been waging war against the rebels, known as Houthis, to restore Yemen's internationally recognized government to power. The rebels say they had been excluded from that government and took power to rectify historic grievances against central authority. The rebel leader, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, said in a statement to journalists that the Iran-backed rebels ordered the cessation of rocket and drone attacks on the Saudis and forces loyal to coalition member the United Arab Emirates at the request of U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths. ""We are ready to freeze and stop military operations on all fronts in order to achieve peace,"" al-Houthi said, mentioning the rockets specifically as part of a longer statement in which he blamed the United States for being the main driver for what he called ""the aggression"" against Yemen. Yemen's civil war began in the wake of its Arab Spring uprising, when the Houthis swept down from their northern stronghold and took the capital, Sanaa, in 2014, with the help of troops loyal to Yemen's former strongman, Ali Abdullah Saleh. The government fled the following year, and Saudi Arabia, citing fears that its nemesis Iran was using the Shiite leanings of the revolt to make inroads on the Arabian Peninsula, began launching airstrikes against the rebels. Riyadh formed a coalition of Sunni Arab states, including the UAE, Kuwait, Egypt and Sudan, and launched ground assaults on several fronts but failed to take the capital. After some major setbacks, it began outsourcing the ground fighting to local troops, including a group trained by the UAE in the south. The latest Saudi-led offensive, which began last summer, has been focused on capturing the key rebel-held port city of Hodeida, through which almost all of Yemen's food and desperately needed humanitarian aid flows. Griffiths, the U.N. envoy, announced on Friday that both sides had agreed to attend talks in Sweden ""soon"" aimed at ending the conflict. His announcement followed an informal de-escalation last week around Hodeida, although fighting has continued on the ground in other areas. It was not immediately to what extent the Houthi move on stopping missile fire into the kingdom would stop the overall violence. Truces rarely hold entirely in Yemen's disorderly civil war, where fighting is on several fronts, and peace talks attempts abroad have repeatedly broken down. An estimated 10,000 people have been killed in the war so far, and two-thirds of Yemen's 27 million-strong population relies on aid. More than 8 million are at risk of starvation in what has become the world's worst humanitarian disaster."	nonTerrorism	Religion
UK slammed for not granting asylum to Pakistani Christian Asia Bibi over security fears	"After eight years languishing on death row on what most western leaders contend were unfounded blasphemy charges, newly acquitted Pakistani Christian Asia Bibi remains in hiding from Islamic extremists after the U.K. denied her political asylum out of fear for the safety of their consular staff in Pakistan. The Foreign Office’s decision, made public last week, has been slammed by lawmakers, religious leaders, and other critics who have accused the office of enabling Pakistan’s hardliners to control government asylum policy. “This is shocking. Britain has historically had a quick response to come to the aid of those suffering human rights abuses,” Wilson Chowdhry, Chairman of the British Pakistani Christian Association (BPCA) told Fox News. “But a Christian mother of five who has been exonerated has not been offered asylum.” Unrest began last month after Pakistan’s Supreme Court overturned the charges and acquitted the 53-year-old farmworker. Immediately, protestors flooded the streets led by leaders of extremist Islamist parties, who had long been screaming for Bibi to be taken to the gallows. As fears for Bibi's safety grew, her husband Ashiq Masih urgently requested the U.K. – as well as several other governments, including the United States – to grant the mother and her family safe haven. However, the U.K. high commissioner in Islamabad is said to have cautioned that he would not be able to protect his staff if the request was approved. Thus, the asylum case did not move forward. William Stark, International Christian Concern’s Regional Manager for South Asia acknowledged that while there is ""a real threat to the embassies of the governments involved in helping Asia and those involved in the case,"" he was ""surprised"" the U.K. would take a back seat. The Bibi case continues to trigger both debate and safety concerns for U.K. officials. Sir Simon McDonald, the Foreign Office permanent secretary, declined to give evidence on the matter in a public setting due to its ""sensitive"" nature after Conservative lawmaker Tom Tugendhat, the foreign affairs select committee chair, asked McDonald whether staff should be withdrawn, security increased or British policy was to be “dictated by the mob.” “There have been many advocates for Asia in the UK,” continued Chowdhry, who has since created a petition calling on Western governments to take action, pointing out that a number of Muslim leaders have since been pushing to help Bibi, too. Several British imams last week joined the request from former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who has been championing the woman's case. In his letter of resignation to British Prime Minister Theresa May last week, the Conservative Party's now-former vice chairman Rehman Chishti emphasized that one of his reasons for stepping down was the ""manner in which the Government has dealt with the case regarding Asia Bibi."" ""This is a case that I have worked on passionately since 2012 ... to ensure that justice is done which was handed down by the Pakistan Supreme Court only recently,"" he wrote. ""What I found shocking, is that the British Government is failing to put into practice the core values that our country stands for; religious freedom, justice, morally doing the right thing, and that when we see injustice where an individual’s life is in clear danger and they have been persecuted for their faith, we do all we can to help them."" In Chishti’s view, “the government should not wait to see if another country offers sanctuary, we should have had the conviction to lead on this matter and offer sanctuary ourselves straight away.” The UK’s Foreign and Commonwealth office did not respond to a request for comment. Amid the turmoil, the Pakistani government has moved Bibi and her family from the jail they had been using as a safe house to an undisclosed secure location. “Many speculate that Asia and her family have been moved to a military facility near Islamabad, but this has not been confirmed. It seems that the government is currently negotiating when Asia will leave Pakistan and where she will be granted asylum,” said Stark. “The lives of Asia and her family are absolutely in danger. If released to the public, it is very likely that religious fanatics would attempt to kill Asia and her family. Even within the secure facility provided by the government, Asia’s life could be in danger.” Chowdhry said what is most disturbing about the ongoing situation is videos that have emerged showing children play-acting at hanging Bibi. Asia Bibi, an impoverished minority Christian, was sentenced to death in 2010 after Muslim neighbors accused her of drinking from a contaminated a water jug, an offense viewed as blasphemy. “The charges against Bibi were always based on mob mania against blasphemy. There was never anything to the charges as the Supreme Court noted,” contended David Curry, president and CEO of Christian persecution watchdog, Open Doors USA. “The protests are not surprising, but it is disappointing the Pakistani government hasn’t moved swiftly to get her to safety. It is not clear to me why any free society wouldn’t see fit to accept her. She has been the victim of a terrible injustice.” Asia’s blasphemy case has remained one of the most rousing religious issues in Pakistan for nearly a decade and has led to at least two high profile political assassinations. Salman Taseer, then governor of Punjab, was assassinated by his elite bodyguard who was influenced by religious fanatics. “A similar assassination could be possible if Asia remains in Pakistan too long,” Stark warned. Among Pakistan’s leadership, the matter also remains contentious. One Pakistan official conveyed some frustration at the situation as an example of the government purporting to do the right thing but being drawn into the fanatic rule. PAKISTAN OPEN TO AFRIDI TALKS WITH US, FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS In a call with Antonio Tajani, the President of the European Parliament on the matter last week, newly-installed Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan reportedly doubled-down on the government’s resolve to respect the judgment of the Supreme Court and insisted that Bibi and her family are entitled to all rights. He is also reported to have expressed “serious concern” about the issue of blasphemy abroad and accentuated the need for European countries to “avoid such provocative incidents.” Adnan Khan, Chairman of the U.S-based Council of Pakistan insisted that – contrary to reports – the Pakistan government has indeed “come down very hard on all protesters and the Islamist parties” and resolved that no new charges would be brought against Bibi. According to the 2018 Open Doors World Watch List, Pakistan was the fifth most difficult country to live in as a Christian, trailing only Sudan, Somalia, Afghanistan and North Korea. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. However, in a statement earlier this month, the ministry denied reports that Bibi was banned from departing Pakistan and insisted she “is free to leave the country.” Even if Bibi could sneak out unscathed, to date she has nowhere to officially go. However, several sources tell Fox News that multiple countries, including the U.S., are working to ensure her safe exit from Pakistan. “We have been liaising with diplomats from a number of countries. In regards to the U.S., as we understand it America is working with many countries to ensure Asia Bibi’s safety and the family’s ultimate asylum in the West,” Chowdhry added. “But in the meantime, Asia Bibi is under the auspices of a Pakistani security detail – we hope that an international security detail can assume these responsibilities.” A State Department spokesperson could not comment on the matter but referred to a press conference in which officials reiterated their position that “religious freedom is universal,” and that the Bibi case has been closely followed. Only the worse may be yet to come. “It is highly likely that we will see additional protests when it is announced that Asia has been allowed to leave Pakistan and seek asylum,” Stark added. “But the important thing now is to keep the pressure on Pakistan to allow Asia and her family to seek asylum outside of the country. The Pakistani government will be under significant pressure from domestic extremists to reverse Asia’s acquittal and execute her."""	nonTerrorism	Religion
Holocaust scholar sues group that said he 'slandered' Poland	"A prominent Holocaust researcher said Friday that he is suing a Polish organization for libel after it waged a public campaign last year accusing him of slandering Poland's good name with his work exploring Polish violence against Jews during World War II. Historian Jan Grabowski, of the University of Ottawa in Canada, told The Associated Press he brought a lawsuit on Thursday against the Polish League Against Defamation, an organization allied with Poland's conservative ruling party. The head of the organization, Maciej Swirski, said he had not received formal notification of the suit yet and would only comment after he does. Last year, the league said Grabowski ""falsifies the history of Poland, proclaiming the thesis that Poles are complicit in the extermination of Jews."" ""During World War II, due to the demoralizing circumstances and German actions, it is true that vile-acting individuals could be found among Poles and Jews alike,"" the group wrote in a statement signed by dozens of Polish academics. ""Yet, we should remember that the objective of the Germans was also to 'eradicate the Polish nation' and 'completely destroy Poland.'"" The anti-defamation organization has been part of a broader effort under the government of the populist Law and Justice party to challenge research on Polish participation in the killing of Jews by Nazi Germany. Poland was under German occupation during World War II. ""What is important, from my point of view, is that the militant nationalists who nowadays hold sway in Poland be warned that they will be held to account, that they are wrong if they think that their outrageous statements and slanders will go unnoticed,"" Grabowski, who was born and attended university in Warsaw, told the AP. Official efforts under the Law and Justice government have included promoting the memory of the Polish gentiles who sheltered Jews during the war. Scholars who research Polish violence against Jews have faced censure and prosecution. The issue came under international scrutiny earlier this year when Polish lawmakers voted to make it illegal to blame the nation for Holocaust crimes. The law has since been amended to remove prison as a possible punishment for violators, though individuals can still be tried and fined. The measure created a rift with Israel and was also condemned by the U.S. Also Friday, the Polish ambassador to Germany, Andrzej Przylebski, accused Germans of frequently reducing World War II to the Holocaust ""as if Adolf Hitler was primarily or exclusively concerned with the murder of European Jews."" At a Berlin conference attended by the German foreign minister, Przylebski said Polish victims ""are almost completely forgotten or downplayed,"" according to a report from the Wirtualna Polska news portal. Grabowski's ""Hunt for the Jews: Betrayal and Murder in German-Occupied Poland"" documents the involvement of Poles in one rural area in finding and killing Jews who had escaped from ghettos and were trying to survive by hiding among gentiles. It was awarded the 2014 Yad Vashem International Book Prize for Holocaust Research. The book also sparked heated debates, and the scholar says he received death threats after its publication. After a German newspaper reviewed the book favorably, a far-right Polish website ran an article with a photograph of the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. The headline was ""Sieg Heil, Herr Grabowski, Three Times Sieg Heil."""	nonTerrorism	Religion
Rohingya refugee camp quiet after Bangladesh postpone return	"Normal life returned to a Rohingya Muslim refugee camp in Bangladesh on Friday a day after government officials postponed plans to begin repatriating residents to Myanmar when no one volunteered to go. The checkpoints at the entrance to Unchiprang, one of the refugee camps near the city of Cox's Bazar, were temporarily left unguarded on Friday morning — a sign of easing tensions — as about 500 people crowded into a mosque for Friday prayers. One of the imams, Abdul Hakim, told the devotees that the government could not force Rohingya to go back without Myanmar guaranteeing them protection and civil rights, to which they raised their hands and replied, ""Amen."" More than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled to Bangladesh from western Myanmar's Rakhine state since August 2017 to escape killings and destruction of their villages by the military and Buddhist vigilantes that have drawn widespread condemnation of Myanmar. Bangladesh's refugee commission had planned to begin a voluntary repatriation process under a United Nations-brokered deal with Myanmar by escorting about 150 refugees across the border on Thursday. But some people on the repatriation list left their shanties and disappeared into other camps to avoid being sent home. After a demonstration involving about 1,000 Rohingya broke out at Unchiprang, Refugee Commissioner Abul Kalam said plans had been shelved because no refugees were willing to return. Kalam did not immediately return calls and messages on Friday, and it was unclear when the process would begin again. Nabi Hossain, 45, left his shanty at Unchiprang camp late Wednesday with his wife, Jamila Begum, and six other family members after noticing extra security at the camp. ""We heard they will come and take us. We were in a panic,"" Hossain said, adding that the family slept outside and didn't eat much because they didn't want a cooking fire to attract attention. They returned Thursday after hearing about the protest. ""If they allow us to have our rights, our citizenship, we want to go. But if we are forced, if our rights are not given, it is better to crush us under the wheels of cars or be thrown in a river,"" Hossain said. Not everyone who fled Unchiprang has returned. Johara, 30, a mother of four, said her husband left five days ago with their 6-year-old daughter, who was traumatized after witnessing Myanmar soldiers ransack her home village. ""My daughter is terrified. She told her father to take her with him,"" she said. Johara, who goes by one name, said her husband left to find his parents at another camp after she gave an interview to aid workers, and the family found out they were on the government's repatriation list. While Johara waited for her husband and daughter to return, activity at Unchiprang returned to normal, with little sign of the aid workers, journalists or government officials who had swarmed the camp earlier in the week."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Bishop reported missing amid Beijing-Vatican reconciliation	" A bishop who has resisted demands to join China's Communist Party-controlled church body has been taken into custody, a Catholic news service reported, despite recent moves by Beijing and the Holy See toward reconciliation. Asia News reported that Peter Shao Zhumin dropped out of sight several days ago, but gave no details other than saying he had been subjected to ""dozens of days of indoctrination as in the times of the Cultural Revolution,"" a reference to Mao Zedong's radical 1966-76 attack on traditional Chinese culture, religion and the intelligentsia. Shao was appointed by the pope in 2016 and posted to the southeastern city of Wenzhou, which has a large Christian community. Officials reached Friday by phone at the local religious affairs bureau, its department regulating the Catholic church and police headquarters said they had no knowledge of Shao's situation and refused to give their names. Shao's disappearance follows a breakthrough agreement to give China some say over the appointment of bishops that critics called a cave-in to the ruling party just as it is waging a sweeping crackdown on religion. Others characterized it as an imperfect but much-needed step toward uniting Catholics in the world's most populous country. The Vatican has long hoped to bring together China's 12 million Catholics who are divided between those worshipping in state-sanctioned churches and the underground priests and parishioners loyal to the pope, who are frequently detained and harassed. Details of the September agreement haven't been released, although analysts say the Vatican will retain the power to put forward candidates while Beijing will likely have the right to refuse them. Such moves are seen as a concession on the Vatican's part in the face of Beijing's assertion that it would not allow ""foreign forces"" to govern the country's faith groups. Under president and Communist Party leader Xi Jinping, the authorities have in recent months cracked down heavily on Protestants, Catholics, Muslims and Buddhists in the name of national security and the ""Sinosization"" of religion."	nonTerrorism	Religion
"Australia, Malaysia trade words over Israel embassy shift"	"A top Australian official seized Friday on past comments from Malaysia's prime minister seen as anti-Semitic, amid a diplomatic war of words over the possibility of Canberra moving its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad raised the potential embassy switch in a meeting with Australian counterpart Scott Morrison in Singapore on Thursday, later telling reporters such a move could increase the threat of terrorism. ""I pointed out that in dealing with terrorism, one has to know the causes,"" Mahathir said. ""Adding to the cause for terrorism is not going to be helpful."" Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg responded Friday, saying Canberra would make its own decisions. Frydenberg, the son of a Holocaust survivor, also pointed out past comments that the leader of Muslim-majority Malaysia has made about Jewish people. ""He has called Jews 'hooked-nosed people.' He has questioned the number of people that have been killed in the Holocaust. He banned 'Schindler's List' as a movie being shown,"" Frydenberg told reporters in Melbourne. In an interview with the BBC last month, Mahathir said ""the problem in the Middle East began with the creation of Israel,"" and he defended his description of Jews as ""hook-nosed"" in his book, ""The Malay Dilemma."" ""They are hook-nosed. Many people called the Malays fat-nosed. We didn't object,"" he told the BBC. Mahathir also challenged historical accounts that 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust, saying the figure was 4 million. In 1994, ""Schindler's List"" became one of many films banned in Malaysia during Mahathir's previous time as prime minister, with the country's film board rejecting it as Zionist propaganda. When asked by The Associated Press in an August interview about his past comments about Jewish people, Mahathir said ""we should be able to criticize everybody."" ""Anti-Semitic is a term that is invented to prevent people from criticizing the Jews for doing wrong things,"" he said. Australia's indication that it may follow the United States' contentious move of relocating its embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv was seen by many Australians as a political stunt. Critics called it a cynical attempt to win votes in a by-election last month for a Sydney seat with a high Jewish population. But on Friday, Frydenberg insisted shifting the embassy made sense, although it has also inflamed tensions with Australia's closest neighbor, Muslim-majority Indonesia. ""Australia already recognizes Israel's sovereignty over West Jerusalem. It's where the Israeli Parliament is. It's where the Australian ambassador presents his or her credentials. It will be the capital of Israel under any two-state solution,"" Frydenberg said. Morrison said Friday that a decision on the embassy would be made by Christmas, but rejected fears the plan had caused collateral damage by placing in jeopardy a proposed free trade agreement with Indonesia. ""I do not conflate the issues,"" Morrison told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. ""What we need to understand is that Australia has to set its own foreign policy and all I have said is that we would consider this question if we believed that it would advance the issues of the two-state solution."" Indonesian opposition politician Dian Islamiati Fatwa also warned this week that Australia moving its embassy may provoke Islamic radicals in his country."	nonTerrorism	Religion
UN committee criticizes human rights violations in Iran	"A U.N. committee on human rights approved a resolution Thursday urging Iran to stop its widespread use of arbitrary detention and expressing serious concern at its ""alarmingly high"" use of the death penalty. The General Assembly's Human Rights Committee adopted the resolution by a vote of 85-30, with 68 abstentions. It is virtually certain to be approved by the 193-member world body next month. The resolution ""strongly urges"" Iran to eliminate discrimination against women in law and practice and expresses ""serious concern about ongoing severe limitations and restrictions on the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief."" It singles out violations including harassment, intimidation and persecution against religious minorities including Christians, Gonabadi Dervishes, Jews, Sufi Muslims, Sunni Muslims, Yarsanis, Zoroastrians and members of the Baha'i faith — and urges the release of religious practitioners including Baha'i leaders. The resolution, sponsored by Canada, also calls on Iran to end ""widespread and serious restrictions"" including on freedom of assembly of political opponents, human rights defenders, labor leaders, environmentalists, academics, filmmakers, journalists, bloggers, social media users and others. While the resolution welcomes the elimination of the death penalty for some drug-related offenses, it expresses serious concern at the ""alarmingly high frequency"" of Iran's use of the death penalty, including against minors. Iran's deputy U.N. ambassador, Eshagh Al Habib, dismissed the resolution as a ""political charade,"" saying promoting the human rights of Iranians ""is not simply a legal and moral responsibility, but a paramount requirement of national security."" ""Similar to any other country, deficiencies may exist, and we are determined to address them,"" he said. ""However, it is not for those who traditionally, historically and practically supported colonialism, slavery, racism and apartheid to lecture Iranians on human rights."" Alluding to the resolution's sponsor and more than 30 co-sponsors, including the United States, Al Habib said that threatening cuts in financial and development funds to get votes ""further exposes the dishonesty of these self-assured champions of human rights."" Ambassador Abdallah Al-Mouallimi of Saudi Arabia, a regional rival of Iran, said, ""The Iranian people continue to suffer under a regime that does not respect human rights, that denies freedoms, that persecutes religious and racial minorities."" He called on Iran not ""give shelter to terrorists."""	nonTerrorism	Religion
Italy's bishops respond to long-ignored clergy sex abuse	"Italy's Catholic bishops are declaring a new era of transparency and truth about clergy sex abuse, as awareness of the scandal that has convulsed much of the Catholic world begins to take hold in a country where it was long ignored. Cardinal Gualtiero Bassetti, president of the Italian bishops' conference, said Thursday that a national advisory center of lay and religious experts is being created to help dioceses educate personnel about protecting children and help bishops investigate abuse reports. Italy's bishops have lagged behind their counterparts in much of the West in confronting clergy sex abuse. Their first guidelines, published in 2014, made clear bishops were under no obligation to report crimes to police. While the scandal hasn't yet erupted in Italy on the scale that it has elsewhere, there have been several high-profile cases of abuse and cover-up by bishops that show the Italian church is by no means immune to the problem. Bassetti acknowledged that ""in the past"" the Italian church sought to avoid scandal at all cost by keeping cases quiet. But he said the Italian bishops, at their just-concluded national assembly, had made a ""radical, evangelical choice"" toward transparency. ""The Gospel says there shouldn't be scandals, but if there are scandals, it's better that they are exposed so that the truth can triumph,"" he told reporters. ""This calls us all to a great transparency."" He said the Italian church is updating its guidelines, but it's not clear to what extent the revised norms will address when bishops cover up abuse or are themselves accused of sexual misconduct, an issue that dominated the just-ended conference of U.S. bishops this week. Pope Francis, who as bishop of Rome has a unique relationship with the Italian conference, has summoned bishops from around the world to a February summit on abuse prevention."	nonTerrorism	Religion
China says foreign concerns over Muslim rights unwarranted	" China said Thursday that 15 foreign ambassadors exceeded their diplomatic roles by issuing a letter expressing concern about the incarceration of hundreds of thousands of members of the country's Muslim minorities in re-education camps. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters at a daily briefing that it would be ""problematic"" if the diplomats were attempting to put pressure on local authorities in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, where the detentions have taken place. Hua said the letter violated the terms of the Vienna Convention governing diplomatic relations and that the ambassadors should not ""interfere in the internal affairs of other countries."" She said the letter was based on hearsay, despite widely distributed reports from detainees, relatives and officials documenting the sweeping and seemingly arbitrary detentions. ""As ambassadors, they are supposed to play positive roles in promoting mutual understanding, mutual trust and cooperation ... rather than making unreasonable requests to the countries where they are based,"" Hua said. The letter issued this week was signed by 15 Western ambassadors, including the Canadian, British, French, Swiss, European Union, German, and Australian envoys, according to the Reuters news agency. Hua's comments came as legislation is being brought by a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers who want President Donald Trump to help Chinese Muslims respond to the crackdown. Xinjiang's native Uighur and Kazakh ethnic groups are culturally, religiously and linguistically distinct from China's Han majority and the region has been home to a low-intensity rebellion against rule from Beijing. Many of the region's natives say their culture is under threat from Chinese policies aiming to assimilate them and that they face disadvantages in education and employment from Han migrants from other parts of China. Also on Thursday, China's Cabinet released a report entitled ""Protection and Development of Xinjiang Culture,"" that stressed the importance of adopting Mandarin Chinese among ethnic groups and referred to their Islamic faith as ""religious culture."" ""Xinjiang adheres to the historical tradition of the Sinosization of religion and actively adapts religion to socialist society,"" the report said."	nonTerrorism	Religion
" The Latest: Former Macedonian PM wrong to flee, party says"	"The Latest on the former prime minister who fled Macedonia (all times local): The fugitive Macedonian former prime minister's conservative party says he should not have fled to Hungary, even though the party called him a victim of persecution. The VMRO-DPMNE party claimed in a statement Wednesday that Nikola Gruevski had been subjected to ""political persecution"" by Macedonian authorities. Party spokesman Naum Stoilkovski accused the left-led government of using Gruevski's case to stage ""cheap political theatre to cover its own weakness and lack of capability."" Stoilovski added that Gruevski's flight to Hungary could create problems for other VMRO officials who face similar charges. Earlier Wednesday, authorities temporarily jailed two other conservative former government officials facing corruption charges, citing the risk that they too might try to flee. The Hungarian government says the former prime minister of Macedonia, who fled his country to avoid a two-year prison sentence for corruption, has requested asylum. Nikola Gruevski is considered to be close to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose office said Tuesday it considers the asylum request ""solely a legal issue"" and sees Macedonia as ""a strategic partner and an important ally."" Hungarian opposition parties are demanding that the Orban government deny the asylum request and hand over Gruevski to Macedonian authorities. Orban's office says Gruevski intends to submit a request for refugee status in Hungary. --This item has been corrected to show that the first name of the ex-prime minister is Nikola, not Nikolas. Macedonian authorities have temporarily jailed two former government officials on trial for corruption, after the former prime minister fled to Hungary to avoid serving a two-year prison term. A criminal court on Wednesday ordered former transport minister Mile Janakieski and former government secretary-general Kiril Bozinovski to be held for 30 days. Prosecutors sought their detention amid fears they could also try to flee the country. They are on trial on charges including corruption over public contracts and election fraud. Interior minister Oliver Spasovski said late Tuesday that Macedonia will seek the extradition from Hungary of Nikola Gruevski, who was prime minister from 2006-2016. Gruevski, currently a lawmaker for the main opposition party, was convicted of influencing officials to purchase a luxury car for government use."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Lebanese civil war rivals end decades of hostility	" Two rival Lebanese Christian leaders reconciled Wednesday ending four decades of enmity triggered by a massacre of dozens during Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war. Samir Geagea, leader of the Lebanese Forces group, and Sleiman Frangieh of the Marada Party shook hands and kissed each other on the cheeks at the headquarters of the Maronite Christian church north of Beirut. The reconciliation was sponsored by Cardinal Bechara al-Rai, head of the Maronite church, Lebanon's largest. Geagea and Frangieh met in the past, but Wednesday marked the end of a bitter rivalry tainted with blood. ""It is so nice for brothers to sit together. I welcome you through prayers as happiness fills my heart and the heart of all Lebanese,"" al-Rai said in a speech after the two leaders met in front of journalists. The two leaders are Maronite Christian and are both presidential hopefuls. Their reconciliation comes at a time when both their relations have become tense with foreign minister, Gibran Bassil, another presidential hopeful who heads the Free Patriotic Movement founded by President Michel Aoun. According to Lebanon's power-sharing system, Lebanon's president must be a Christian Maronite. Frangieh is a close friend of Syrian President Bashar Assad and is allied with the militant Hezbollah group while Geagea is with the Western and Saudi-backed coalition and is a harsh critic of both Assad and Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. In 1978, members of the main Christian militia killed Frangieh's father, Tony, as well as his mother and sister and 30 Marada fighters and supporters. Geagea led the raid in the mountain resort of Ehden but was seriously wounded and withdrew from the operation. Last week, Frangieh met with the families of those killed four decades ago and asked if he can go ahead with the reconciliation and received their support. At the end of the meeting, Geagea told reporters: ""Today is a beautiful day. What better thing do we need. It is a white day, a historic day."" Frangieh had a brief comment saying: ""This is a new page that we open today."""	nonTerrorism	Religion
Mahathir slams Myanmar's Suu Kyi for handling of Rohingya	"Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed sharply criticized Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Tuesday for her handling of an ethnic crisis that led to mass killings and the exodus of more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims from her country. Mahathir said Nobel Peace Prize laureate Suu Kyi was ""trying to defend the indefensible"" in justifying violence by Myanmar security forces against Rohingya in Rakhine state. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have fled to neighboring Bangladesh since August 2017. ""They are actually oppressing these people to the point of, well, killing them, mass killing, and burial in graves dug by the victims and that kind of thing. That may be relevant in ancient times, but in modern days, we don't do that kind of thing,"" said Mahathir, a 93-year-old political veteran whose own past treatment of dissidents at times drew opprobrium. Asked about the issue at a news conference on the sidelines of a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Singapore, Mahathir said that as a former political prisoner, Suu Kyi should understand suffering. It is unusual for leaders in the 10-nation group to publicly criticize each other. Suu Kyi became an icon for democracy after spending about 15 years under house arrest for opposing Myanmar's earlier military dictatorship. She and her Buddhist-majority government have been widely criticized for the way they have treated the Muslim Rohingya. In Geneva, the U.N. human rights chief said Tuesday that Bangladesh should halt plans to repatriate over 2,200 of the Rohingya refugees to Myanmar, saying such a move would endanger their lives. Michelle Bachelet's comments are among the strongest yet from a top United Nations official about the planned repatriation this week of some Rohingya. Bachelet's office said it continues to receive reports of rights violations in Rakhine state, ""which include allegations of killings, disappearances and arbitrary arrests."" It said some 130,000 people, including many Rohingya, remain internally displaced in central Rakhine. On Monday, the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR advised against the returns, saying safety should be assessed first. But it did not call for a halt to the repatriation plans. Associated Press writer Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Religion
"Amid crisis, pope gives Vatican's sex abuse expert new role"	"Pope Francis is giving a prominent new role to the Vatican's most trusted sex crimes investigator in a sign that he's looking to improve the Holy See's response to abuse at a time when the church and papacy are facing a credibility crisis. Francis on Tuesday named Archbishop Charles Scicluna as a deputy, or adjunct secretary, at the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican office that processes sex abuse cases globally. Scicluna had been the congregation's chief prosecutor for a decade and was credited with measures making it easier to defrock pedophiles. But Pope Benedict XVI sent him to his native Malta in 2012 as bishop after Scicluna's tough line ruffled too many feathers in the Vatican. Scicluna's new appointment is symbolically significant and will also give him greater say in the day-to-day running of the congregation, even though he retains his post in Malta. Francis clearly trusts him after he asked Scicluna to conduct an in-depth investigation in Chile earlier this year that revealed Francis' gross misunderstanding of an abuse and cover-up scandal there. Scicluna's return comes as Francis and the church at large are under fire again for the way the Vatican and religious superiors around the globe turned a blind eye to priests who raped and molested children. The crisis is particularly acute in the U.S., where prosecutors in more than a dozen states have announced investigations into abuse and cover-up following the revelations of the Pennsylvania grand jury report. In addition, U.S. bishops are reeling from allegations that one of their own, ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, preyed on seminarians and at least two minors, and that his misconduct with adults was an open secret in the U.S. and Vatican. Francis' record on abuse has long been uneven, and his papacy has been rocked by claims by a Vatican archbishop that he rehabilitated McCarrick in 2013 from sanctions imposed by Benedict. Francis' credibility took another hit this week when the Vatican blocked U.S. bishops from voting on a new code of conduct and a commission involving lay experts to review complaints against brother bishops."	nonTerrorism	Religion
"Explosion in Kabul targets anti-Taliban rally, killing 3"	"An explosion struck near an anti-Taliban rally in the Afghan capital on Monday, killing at least three people, officials said as authorities reported that the insurgents killed at least 20 members of the country's security forces over the past 24 hours in eastern Ghazni province. It was not immediately clear if the blast in Kabul was from a bomb that was detonated by remote control or from a suicide bomber. The explosion took place about 500 meters (yards) from where hundreds of minority Shiites had gathered to denounce the latest Taliban attacks in Ghazni districts of Jaghuri and Malistan. Najib Danish, the Interior Ministry's spokesman, confirmed the explosion but could not immediately provide more details. Wahid Mujroh, spokesman for the Health Ministry, said so far at least three were confirmed dead while eight wounded people were brought to hospital. Local media in Kabul said the explosion, which also took place near a high school, was set off by a suicide bomber. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the explosion. Both a resurgent Taliban, who now control nearly half of Afghanistan and stage near-daily attacks on Afghan forces, and the Islamic State group's affiliate in the region have been behind many recent Kabul attacks and bombings. Meanwhile, Afghan lawmaker Ali Akbar Qasemi said fighting since Sunday in Ghazni has focused on the district of Jaghuri where 20 policemen have been killed. The Afghan army chief, Gen. Mohammad Sharif Yaftali, told reporters that government forces have sustained casualties in the battles but declined to elaborate on specifics or say how many were killed. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the Jaghuri attacks and claimed in a text message sent to the media that the Taliban have also captured Ghazni's district of Malistan. There was no immediate response from authorities on the Malistan claim. Ghazni is the only one out of 34 Afghan provinces where the country's October parliamentary elections could not take place for security reasons. Voting there has been postponed for a year. In August, the Taliban overran parts of the provincial capital, also called Ghazni. At the time, hundreds of people fled the city amid intense fighting between Afghan forces and insurgents that killed about 120 members of the security forces and civilians. According to Afghan authorities, nearly 200 insurgents, many of them foreign fighters, were also killed."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Moroccans hold anti-terror vigil for slain Nordic hikers	" Moroccans gathered Saturday in front of the Norwegian and Danish embassies in Rabat in a candlelight vigil to honor two Scandinavian university students killed in a terrorist attack in the Atlas Mountains. Hundreds of people brought flowers and shed tears Saturday in a show of opposition to violence and religious extremism. They were honoring 28-year-old Norwegian Maren Ueland and 24-year-old Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, whose bodies were found Monday. Authorities say the hikers were killed by four men affiliated with the Islamic State group. The killings shocked Moroccans as much as those in Denmark and Norway. ""I am deeply touched by the kind reactions of the Moroccan people after the tragic event,"" the Norwegian ambassador to Morocco, Merethe Nergaard, said in a statement Saturday. The mourners included ordinary Moroccans joined by politicians, artists and activists. Some held banners saying ""Sorry"" and condemned the brutal killing, which is unusual in Morocco and revived fears of terrorism. ""Words cannot describe this barbaric crime,"" said Khalil Bensalmi, in his fifties, who came to the vigil with his two daughters. ""This doesn't at all represent Moroccan society or its pacifist culture."" The group first held a vigil in front of the Norwegian Embassy, read a letter in memory of the two women, then held a moment of silence. Many attendees cried. They then quietly departed to the Danish Embassy, where again tears were shed, and candles were lit in honor of the two women, university students passionate about the outdoors. Ratiba Naji, a housewife, tried to hold back her emotions as she said, ""It's horrendous. These girls deserve life. Their parents must be devastated. I am sorry."" A torch-lit parade was held in Ueland's hometown in Norway on Friday. The killings marked the first terrorist attack to hit Morocco since 2011, when a suicide bomber detonated in Marrakech and killed 16 people. More than 1,000 Moroccans have joined IS in recent years, and Moroccan authorities arrested 20 cells with terrorist affiliations between 2017 and 2018. The hikers' killings triggered fear among Moroccans of a renewed terrorist threat. Samira Laziri, a journalist for national radio, who came to the vigil to protest against terrorism, said, ""We thought that we were safe, but sadly there are still terrorist cells in the country and unfortunately we still have a lot of youth who get influenced"" by extremist forces. Thirteen men have been detained in the investigation."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Pope to priestly sex abusers: Turn yourselves in	"Pope Francis vowed Friday that the Catholic Church will ""never again"" cover up clergy sex abuse and demanded that priests who have raped and molested children turn themselves in. Francis dedicated his annual Christmas speech to the Vatican bureaucracy to abuse, evidence that a year of devastating revelations of sexual misconduct and cover-up has shaken his papacy and caused a crisis of confidence in the Catholic hierarchy. Francis acknowledged that the church in the past had failed to treat the problem seriously, blaming leaders who out of inexperience or short-sightedness acted ""irresponsibly"" by refusing to believe victims. But he vowed that going forward the church would never cover up or dismiss cases again. ""Let it be clear that before these abominations the Church will spare no effort to do all that is necessary to bring to justice whosoever has committed such crimes,"" he said. He urged victims to come forward, thanked the media for giving them a voice and issued a stark warning to abusers: ""Convert and hand yourself over to human justice, and prepare for divine justice."" Francis' remarks capped a dreadful year for the Catholic Church, one that began with his own botched handling of a sprawling sex abuse scandal in Chile and ended with the U.S. hierarchy in a free-fall of credibility as state prosecutors have begun uncovering decades of cover-up. Francis has summoned church leaders from around the globe for a February abuse prevention summit, in an indication that he has come to realize that the problem is far greater and far more global than he had understood at the start of his papacy five years ago. Francis warned the Vatican bureaucrats who run the 1.2 billion strong Church that the scandal now undermined the credibility of the entire enterprise and that from now on the church and all its pastors must embark on a continuous path of purification. He prayed for help so that the Church can discern true cases from false ones, and accusations from slander. ""This is no easy task, since the guilty are capable of skillfully covering their tracks,"" and choosing victims who they know will keep silent. He urged those who have been abused to speak out. ""The Church asks that people not be silent, but bring it objectively to light, since the greater scandal in this matter is that of cloaking the truth,"" he said. The cardinals and bishops of the Curia listened attentively, including the dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, who has long been blamed for the Vatican's refusal to acknowledge the depth of the problem during the quarter-century pontificate of St. John Paul II."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Indonesian Muslims protest China's detention of Uighurs	"Several hundred protesters chanted ""God is Great"" and ""Get out, communist!"" outside China's embassy in the Indonesian capital on Friday, demanding an end to mass detentions of Uighur Muslims. The white-robed protesters, almost outnumbered by police, waved banners emblazoned with ""Muslims unite to free Uighurs"" and flags bearing the Islamic declaration of faith. Protest organizer Slamet Ma'arif told the crowd that included members of the Islamic Defenders Front vigilante group that their Muslim brothers were ""suffering oppression, torture and cruelty by the Chinese communist government."" Ma'arif, chairman of a conservative alliance behind the mass protests against Jakarta's minority Christian and ethnic Chinese governor in 2016, said Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, should expel China's ambassador. ""Save the Uighur community and give them freedom to worship as Muslims,"" he said. ""We also call on the Indonesian government to provide real action to help Uighurs like what has been done with Rohingya and we call on Muslims around the world to provide assistance and support for Uighurs,"" Ma'arif said. Up to 1 million ethnic Muslims in China's Xinjiang region are estimated to be detained in camps where they are subjected to political indoctrination and pressured to give up their religion. The Associated Press reported this week that some are forced to work in factories and tracked clothing made in one camp to an American sportswear company. China describes the sites as vocational centers and says the trainees work voluntarily. Indonesia's foreign minister Retno Marsudi on Monday summoned China's ambassador Xiao Qian to explain alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Indonesia relayed the concerns of various groups in Indonesia and stressed that freedom of religion is enshrined in the U.N.'s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, according to foreign ministry spokesman Aarmanatha Nasir. Xiao asserted that China is committed to the protection of human rights and its willingness to provide information about the situation in Xinjiang, Aarmanatha said. Despite those steps, the Indonesian government also says it has no right to interfere in the domestic affairs of other countries. It is reluctant to publicly criticize Beijing, fearing it could jeopardize potential Chinese investment or invite retaliatory Chinese support for separatists in Papua, a predominantly Christian Papua region where a pro-independence insurgency has simmered for more than half a century."	nonTerrorism	Religion
 Fake images show acquitted Christian woman leaving Pakistan	"The Pakistani government, already struggling with a crisis surrounding Aasia Bibi, a Christian woman acquitted of blasphemy charges after eight years on death row, now has to deal with ""fake"" images on social media purporting to show her leaving the country or out of Pakistan. Although it was unclear who was behind the images, which prompted death threats to a lawmaker shown in one photograph, it was likely they were intended to whip up radical religious fervor over Bibi's case. Radical Islamists have blocked Bibi's freedom and demanded that she be publicly executed. They've also filed a petition to repeal her Supreme Court acquittal. The government says Bibi remains in Pakistan, at a secret location for her own protection, until the review process is finished. Prime Minister Imran Khan has warned radical religious groups against using her plight to further their political aims with street protests. He has defended the Supreme Court judges who on Oct. 21 acquitted the 54-year old mother of five of blasphemy charges but has also acquiesced to Islamists that the acquittal be reviewed in an appeal process. Blasphemy is a highly charged issue in Pakistan, where mere allegations or accusations that someone had insulted the Prophet Muhammad can incite mobs into a frenzy of violence. The charge also carries the death penalty and critics say the controversial blasphemy law is abused to settle religious scores. Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry slammed the ""fake"" postings on Monday, one of which claims to show Bibi meeting Pope Francis. The photo is actually of Bibi's daughter from two years ago. Bibi and her family have always maintained her innocence and say she never insulted the prophet. Chaudhry said the images misidentifying Bibi also prompted the death threats to a lawmaker in one photograph, Fazal Khan from the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Party. The lawmaker's constituency is in a deeply conservative region in the country's northwestern. ""People can even be killed because of such fake postings,"" Chaudhry said. The pictures were widely circulated on social media in Pakistan and shared on several local journalists' groups, even a police and a media group. ""We are trying to seek cooperation from Twitter and Facebook against such fake news,"" Chaudhry added. Bibi's ordeal dates back to 2009 when she went to fetch water for herself and fellow farmworkers. An argument took place after two Muslim women refused to drink from the same container as Bibi, who is Roman Catholic. The women later said Bibi had insulted the Prophet Muhammad, and she was charged with blasphemy. She was put on trial, convicted and sentenced to death in 2010. Following Bibi's acquittal last month, the founder of the radical Tehreek-e-Labbak Party, Mohammed Afzal Qadri, issued a fatwa calling for the death of the three Supreme Court judges who handed down the acquittal and the overthrow of Khan's government. He also incited the military to mutiny. Pakistan has seen lynching mobs over blasphemy allegations. In 2011, the governor of Punjab province was killed by his own guard after he defended Bibi and criticized the blasphemy law. A year later, Shahbaz Bhatti, the minister for minorities and a Christian, was shot and killed. Bibi, who was freed from detention last week, is being held at a secret, closely guarded location in Pakistan. Those who are familiar with her circumstances say she is expected to stay at the location until the Supreme Court carries out the review. On Sunday, the prime minister said the Supreme Court's decision would be final. For now, it's unclear when the review will be held or who would defend Bibi since her lawyer Saiful Malook fled the country following her acquittal, fearing for his life."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Burma doubles down on claims to justify treatment of Rohingya minority	"Despite increasing international pressure to end a horribly brutal campaign against a mostly Muslim Rohingya minority, the government of Burma is doubling down on the narrative it's guilty of nothing more than trying to stop the growth of Islamic ""extremism."" “The root cause of this humanitarian issue is because of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) – the Muslim terrorist group,” U.N. Ambassador Hau Do Suan told Fox News in a recent interview. “They attacked against the government in Rakhine State in October 2016 and again in August 2017. This humanitarian problem was ignited by those terrorist attacks.” That explanation has been dismissed by many Western countries and human rights groups, some of whom now believe a repatriation effort to return Rohingya who had fled to neighboring Bangladesh in the face of ethnic cleansing - perhaps even genocide - is a potentially disastrous recipe for further persecution. The Rohingya have “received no assurance of their physical safety,"" said Kristina Arriaga, vice chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), who warned against members of the group returning to Burma, given there “have been no guarantees of protection for their properties, livelihoods or basic human rights, including religious freedom.” USCIRF has called on the U.S. State Department to continue imposing sanctions – many of which were rolled back by the Obama administration – targeting specific “abusers” in the Burmese military, as well as non-state actors. Suan argues the country's ""Bengali Muslim population problem” has been going on since the country achieved its independence from Britain in 1948. He insisted security forces have been responding to a well-founded threat from such Rohingya militants, who attacked police posts in Rakhine state, rather than methodically targeting local people. He called charges of ethnic cleansing “totally insane,” and stressed his government is advocating a “peaceful and voluntary return of the refugees back to their place.” Suan has condemned the U.N. for only listening to “one side” of the story, and not recognizing the injustices undertaken by ARSA. He also asserted that in the wake of the “terrorist attacks,” all peace efforts already in-motion were subsequently “hampered.” But the likes of Amnesty International has turned up troves of evidence of an “orchestrated campaign” of systematic abuses by security forces. Amnesty has also acknowledged a Rohingya armed group wielding guns and swords – known indeed as ARSA – is responsible for at least one, or potentially two, massacres of up to 99 Hindu women, men and children, in addition to “unlawful killings and abductions of Hindu villagers” in Rakhine State, beginning in August 2017. “Accountability for these atrocities is every bit as crucial as it is for the crimes against humanity carried out by Myanmar’s security forces,” said Tirana Hassan, Amnesty’s Crisis Response Director. Though the Rohingya have lived in Burma for generations, they are denied citizenship, and not even recognized as an ethnic minority. Rather, officials refer to them as Suan did - the “Bengali Muslim population.” Suan argued the Muslims in Rakhine state were brought in by the British colony in the late 19th Century, to farm the area. A second wave came in 1971 and 1972, when then-East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, fought Pakistan for its independence, said Suan. “So these people they call Rohingya people are Bengali stock, and speak the Bengali language,” he claimed. The ambassador also claimed the “invented"" Rohingya name ""is not recognized by anyone,” and was created only to “attract the support and attention of the Muslim world.” But the U.N. is among those who in fact do recognize the Rohingya, seen now as one of the world's most persecuted minorities. The Rohingya are victims of beatings, rape, and systematic slaughter, according to human rights groups. Since August of last year, an estimated 10,000 Rohingya are reported to have been murdered, according to the Doctors Without Borders group. And among those victims were 730 children under the age of five. More than 100,000 Rohingya homes are also reported to have been burned to the ground. And at least 750,000 people, according to Amnesty International, have been forced over the border to Bangladesh. More than 200,000 Rohingya were already displaced in the bordering country, having been in camps for years out of fear to return. A report released in July by advocacy group Fortify Rights alleged the flight of some 700,000 Rohingya was sparked by a planned campaign of large-scale slaughter, rape and village burnings in Rakhine. Beginning in October 2016, the report claims military and local officials “methodically removed sharp tools that could be used for self-defense,” and halted aid to the community. Efforts by local journalists to investigate the alleged crimes have been met with severe punishment. In June, Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were sentenced to seven years behind bars for “breaching the country’s official secrets act” after being accused of obtaining classified documents. Their trial was largely viewed as a sham by the international community. But on Friday, in a rare case of good news, the incitement case against three other journalists was withdrawn. Eleven Media editors Kyaw Zaw Lin and Nayi Min, and chief reporter Phyo Wai Win, who were arrested in October but allowed out on bail, were cleared - at least for now. They were accused after an article raised questions about government minister Phyo Min Thein, a close confidant of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The government is also accused of targeting other non-Buddhist religious minorities, including those in the Christian community. Violence has risen as well in the Christian Kachin community, with horrific tales of church burnings, mass killings, and persecution. Suan attempted an explanation for that issue as well. “Kachin people rose against the central government from 1962. The government at that time announced Buddhism as the state religion, and they did not accept this policy,"" he said. ""Since then, they have been fighting the government.” He dismissed any notion government forces were the aggressors. “These things have been going on for so many years, but there is no business for religious discrimination. This is not logical.” A statement provided to Fox News by Myanmar’s Washington Embassy also said “national reconciliation and achieving peace are the priorities of the current civilian government,” and claimed the government is “ready to address issues related to human rights violations in all parts of the country that come up with concrete evidence.” But the United States and human rights groups have been very reluctant to accept the government's account of what's happening with the religious minorities. When Burma was under a complete military rule, the U.S. and most other Western governments heavily sanctioned the regime. But in 2016, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Suu Kyi’s party was voted into power – she serves as State Counselor. Yet the military wing, under terms of the constitution, still rules key ministries, including immigration and home affairs. U.N. investigators last month called on the Security Council to refer Burma to the International Criminal Court, and has explicitly mandated for the country’s officials and top generals to face charges. But Suan said that Suu Kyi – who is yet to formally meet with member of the Trump administration – would very much like the opportunity to talk to the president, or a senior official. “She would be glad to meet with anyone. The U.S. and Myanmar have had a very long and good relationship,” he added. “We would like to maintain that friendly relationship.”"	nonTerrorism	Religion
 Kenya launches internal police probe to help reform force	"Kenya's internal security minister Friday launched a police internal affairs unit to investigate allegations of abuses in the force including corruption and accusations that officers kill suspects and perpetrate other human rights abuses. The new investigation body has been welcomed with optimism by some rights activists, but many remain skeptical on its ability to bring adequate change. The internal affairs unit will put the police on a ""trajectory of reforms,"" Internal Security Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi said. The unit has been launched amid allegations by human rights groups and the public that police killed 22 suspects in the last two weeks in a low-income area of Nairobi. Rights groups have for years claimed that Kenya's police force is riddled with corruption and carries out abuses. Eric Kiraithe, a former police spokesman who is now the government spokesman admitted that corruption in the force saying it ""runs deep and wide."" The local chapter of the international anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International has for more than a decade ranked the Kenyan police as the most corrupt institution in a country where corruption is endemic. The abuses have continued despite an exercise in which all 100,000 officers are being scrutinized, rights advocates say. Some 2,000 officers have been fired out of around 50,000 scrutinized as the exercise which started in December 2013 and is continuing. When that investigation began, body parts from a person reported kidnapped were sent to the National Police Service Commission with a note warning the chairman to tread carefully. The Independent Medico-Legal Unit, or IMLU, has conducted autopsies on the bodies of the 22 killed by police. ""Our preliminary investigations indicate that those were extrajudicial killings,"" said Peter Kiama, the executive director of the group. ""They were not done according to the law. The police were in a position to arrest and not kill those individuals."" The IMLU in 2014 documented how a majority of police killings at that time were connected to police extorting money from suspects and not police work. He said human rights defenders who raised concern about the killings are being threatened. Kiama said the internal affairs unit can be effective if given independence and resources. ""This is a huge investment and the demonstration of political will is a plus,"" he said, adding that despite the challenges facing the new unit, ""there is justification for skepticism but there is space for optimism."""	nonTerrorism	Religion
UN: Majority of locals in Yemen's Hodeida fled amid clashes	"Most of the population of Yemen's Hodeida has been forced to flee amid a Saudi-led coalition offensive to take the key Red Sea port city from Shiite rebels, the United Nations' refugee agency said Friday, as fierce battles continue to rage in the area. Nearly three quarters of Hodeida's estimated 600,000 people have escaped since June, a figure that underscores the dire situation in the city that serves as the main entry point for food and aid, the UNHCR said. It also expressed concern over the safety of those trapped in Hodeida as the intensified military operations ""are increasingly confining populations and cutting off exit routes."" Yemeni government forces covered by the coalition's air and naval forces continue to engage in heavy fighting with the rebels, known as Houthis. The fighting has killed dozens of combatants from both sides, with dozens of military vehicles destroyed or burning along the front lines. In a Friday statement, Yemen's internationally recognized government based in the southern city of Aden said its forces are advancing toward the north and west of Hodeida and across all fronts with cover from the coalition. The fighting around the city, a vital lifeline for most Yemen's population, threatens to worsen Yemen's already-dire humanitarian situation and risks the obstruction of crucial assistance to the country endangering the lives of millions of Yemenis. The Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 with the aim of defeating the Iran-aligned rebels and to restore the government of Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi. But the coalition has recently come under mounting international pressure to end the war that has resulted in what the U.N. says is the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Also on Friday, the Norwegian Refugee Council warned of the repercussions the continued fighting may have on millions of Yemenis. The council estimates the humanitarian cost of the war to have reached almost $3 billion in 2018 alone. ""We are now warning that by allowing this to go on, parties to the conflict and their international backers will be responsible for the death, injury and suffering of millions of people,"" Mohamed Abdi, the council's director in Yemen, said in a statement. ""Senseless attacks on civilians, evidence of a starving population and desperate pleas from humanitarian witnesses have done little more than elicit condolences from an international community that could have stepped on the brakes long ago."" The U.S. and U.K., major arms suppliers to the Saudi coalition, have recently called for a cease-fire in Yemen and the launch of U.N.-led political talks to end the Saudi-Iran proxy war. On Friday, the U.N. special envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths said on his official Twitter account that consultations with Yemen's warring parties to finalize logistical arrangements for a new round of peace talks are underway. Griffiths' latest effort to revive peace talks in September fell through after the Houthis failed to attend."	nonTerrorism	Religion
"AP EXPLAINS: Pakistani Christians, an embattled minority"	"The uproar surrounding Aasia Bibi — a Pakistani Christian woman who was acquitted of blasphemy charges and released from death row but remains at a secret location for her protection — has drawn attention to the plight of the country's Christians. The minority, among Pakistan's poorest, has faced an increasingly intolerant atmosphere in this Muslim-majority nation where radical religious and sectarian groups have become more prominent in recent years. Here is a look at some of the issues involved. WHY HER RELEASE IGNITED AN UPROAR Bibi's Oct. 31 acquittal by Pakistan's supreme court triggered large-scale protests, with religious extremists demanding the 54-year-old mother of five be publicly executed — and that the three judges who set her free also be put to death. Her ordeal started in 2009 after two fellow women farmworkers refused to drink from the same container as a Christian, and later said Bibi had insulted the Prophet Muhammad. The claim led to her arrest and 2010 death sentence on blasphemy charges. In Pakistan, a mere accusation of blasphemy has caused riots, even lynching. Rights groups have said Pakistan's blasphemy law is often used as an excuse to settle scores, or as a weapon against religious minorities, including Shiite Muslims who are at times targeted by Sunni Muslim militants as heretics. Bibi has been in hiding in Islamabad since her release earlier this week. Her family says she will leave Pakistan as soon as possible because of death threats against her. WHO THE PAKISTANI CHRISTIANS ARE There are about 1.3 million Christians in Pakistan, a predominantly Sunni Muslim country of 204 million people. The Christians are the second-largest minority, after Hindus, and are almost evenly divided between Catholic and Protestant denominations. The Christian population grew at the time of Pakistan's creation in 1947, when the Indian subcontinent was divided into two nations. At the time, many lower caste Hindus, living in what would become Pakistan, converted to Christianity. They were among the region's poorest and held jobs many others didn't want. Although some Christians have risen to senior positions, including A.R. Cornelius who served as Pakistan's chief justice, many live in impoverished communities commonly referred to as ""sweeper colonies"" because residents are employed as domestic and sanitation workers. The rise of Islamic radicalism in Pakistan has left the country's minority religions vulnerable. The blasphemy law, which carries the death penalty for anyone convicted of insulting Islam, has been used at times as a tool against minorities. Christian churches and homes have been attacked by crowds invoking the law. Prime Minister Imran Khan, elected in July, in part on an Islamic agenda, has vacillated between criticizing religious parties for using religion to enhance their influence, and bowing to their demands, including firing minorities from government-appointed positions. In Bibi's case, Khan seemingly caved to the Islamists' demand to have her acquittal reviewed in an appeal — though some suspected he was trying to buy time to disperse the protesters. Analysts say mixed signals from the government only embolden extremists. Minority religious leaders also say the poverty of the Christian minority sharply reduces their political clout. HOW CHRISTIANS ARE FARING IN OTHER MUSLIM-MAJORITY COUNTRIES Egypt's Christians, who make up about 10 percent of the country's 100 million Muslim-majority population, have long complained of discrimination and under-representation in government. Sectarian violence occasionally erupts in rural communities where Christian churches have been torched. Overwhelmingly, attacks on Egyptian Copts have been carried out by Islamist extremists, mainly the Islamic State group, which has killed scores of Christians in recent years. Lebanon's Christian community is the second-largest in the Middle East, after Egypt's, but has gone from being a majority to ranging between 30 and 35 percent of the population. Despite their dwindling numbers, Lebanese Christians still retain relative political power with multiple political parties and a president, who must be a Christian Maronite, according to an unwritten national pact. Across the Holy Land, Christians now make up an estimated 1 to 2 percent of the population, a marked decline over the decades. Reasons include a relatively low birth rate and increased emigration by Palestinian Christians, driven by the fallout from the long-running conflict with Israel. In the Gaza Strip, the number of Christians has dropped from 3,000 to 1,000 over the past decade of rule by the Islamic militant group Hamas — a period that has been marked by armed conflict with Israel, border closures and soaring unemployment. Iraq has been seeing a dramatic exodus of its Christians since dictator Saddam Hussein was ousted in 2003. Muslim extremists, mostly from the al-Qaida terror network and later the Islamic State group, have bombed churches and shrines in Baghdad and the city of Mosul, and assassinated high-level bishops and priests. There were thought to be over 1 million Christians living in Iraq before the U.S.-led invasion of 2003; today only a fraction remains. Associated Press writers Menna Zaki in Cairo, Philip Issa in Baghdad, Fares Akram in Gaza City, Gaza Strip, and Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Religion
UK slammed for not granting asylum to Pakistani Christian Asia Bibi over security fears	"After eight years languishing on death row on what most western leaders contend were unfounded blasphemy charges, newly acquitted Pakistani Christian Asia Bibi remains in hiding from Islamic extremists after the U.K. denied her political asylum out of fear for the safety of their consular staff in Pakistan. The Foreign Office’s decision, made public last week, has been slammed by lawmakers, religious leaders, and other critics who have accused the office of enabling Pakistan’s hardliners to control government asylum policy. “This is shocking. Britain has historically had a quick response to come to the aid of those suffering human rights abuses,” Wilson Chowdhry, Chairman of the British Pakistani Christian Association (BPCA) told Fox News. “But a Christian mother of five who has been exonerated has not been offered asylum.” Unrest began last month after Pakistan’s Supreme Court overturned the charges and acquitted the 53-year-old farmworker. Immediately, protestors flooded the streets led by leaders of extremist Islamist parties, who had long been screaming for Bibi to be taken to the gallows. As fears for Bibi's safety grew, her husband Ashiq Masih urgently requested the U.K. – as well as several other governments, including the United States – to grant the mother and her family safe haven. However, the U.K. high commissioner in Islamabad is said to have cautioned that he would not be able to protect his staff if the request was approved. Thus, the asylum case did not move forward. William Stark, International Christian Concern’s Regional Manager for South Asia acknowledged that while there is ""a real threat to the embassies of the governments involved in helping Asia and those involved in the case,"" he was ""surprised"" the U.K. would take a back seat. The Bibi case continues to trigger both debate and safety concerns for U.K. officials. Sir Simon McDonald, the Foreign Office permanent secretary, declined to give evidence on the matter in a public setting due to its ""sensitive"" nature after Conservative lawmaker Tom Tugendhat, the foreign affairs select committee chair, asked McDonald whether staff should be withdrawn, security increased or British policy was to be “dictated by the mob.” “There have been many advocates for Asia in the UK,” continued Chowdhry, who has since created a petition calling on Western governments to take action, pointing out that a number of Muslim leaders have since been pushing to help Bibi, too. Several British imams last week joined the request from former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who has been championing the woman's case. In his letter of resignation to British Prime Minister Theresa May last week, the Conservative Party's now-former vice chairman Rehman Chishti emphasized that one of his reasons for stepping down was the ""manner in which the Government has dealt with the case regarding Asia Bibi."" ""This is a case that I have worked on passionately since 2012 ... to ensure that justice is done which was handed down by the Pakistan Supreme Court only recently,"" he wrote. ""What I found shocking, is that the British Government is failing to put into practice the core values that our country stands for; religious freedom, justice, morally doing the right thing, and that when we see injustice where an individual’s life is in clear danger and they have been persecuted for their faith, we do all we can to help them."" In Chishti’s view, “the government should not wait to see if another country offers sanctuary, we should have had the conviction to lead on this matter and offer sanctuary ourselves straight away.” The UK’s Foreign and Commonwealth office did not respond to a request for comment. Amid the turmoil, the Pakistani government has moved Bibi and her family from the jail they had been using as a safe house to an undisclosed secure location. “Many speculate that Asia and her family have been moved to a military facility near Islamabad, but this has not been confirmed. It seems that the government is currently negotiating when Asia will leave Pakistan and where she will be granted asylum,” said Stark. “The lives of Asia and her family are absolutely in danger. If released to the public, it is very likely that religious fanatics would attempt to kill Asia and her family. Even within the secure facility provided by the government, Asia’s life could be in danger.” Chowdhry said what is most disturbing about the ongoing situation is videos that have emerged showing children play-acting at hanging Bibi. Asia Bibi, an impoverished minority Christian, was sentenced to death in 2010 after Muslim neighbors accused her of drinking from a contaminated a water jug, an offense viewed as blasphemy. “The charges against Bibi were always based on mob mania against blasphemy. There was never anything to the charges as the Supreme Court noted,” contended David Curry, president and CEO of Christian persecution watchdog, Open Doors USA. “The protests are not surprising, but it is disappointing the Pakistani government hasn’t moved swiftly to get her to safety. It is not clear to me why any free society wouldn’t see fit to accept her. She has been the victim of a terrible injustice.” Asia’s blasphemy case has remained one of the most rousing religious issues in Pakistan for nearly a decade and has led to at least two high profile political assassinations. Salman Taseer, then governor of Punjab, was assassinated by his elite bodyguard who was influenced by religious fanatics. “A similar assassination could be possible if Asia remains in Pakistan too long,” Stark warned. Among Pakistan’s leadership, the matter also remains contentious. One Pakistan official conveyed some frustration at the situation as an example of the government purporting to do the right thing but being drawn into the fanatic rule. PAKISTAN OPEN TO AFRIDI TALKS WITH US, FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS In a call with Antonio Tajani, the President of the European Parliament on the matter last week, newly-installed Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan reportedly doubled-down on the government’s resolve to respect the judgment of the Supreme Court and insisted that Bibi and her family are entitled to all rights. He is also reported to have expressed “serious concern” about the issue of blasphemy abroad and accentuated the need for European countries to “avoid such provocative incidents.” Adnan Khan, Chairman of the U.S-based Council of Pakistan insisted that – contrary to reports – the Pakistan government has indeed “come down very hard on all protesters and the Islamist parties” and resolved that no new charges would be brought against Bibi. According to the 2018 Open Doors World Watch List, Pakistan was the fifth most difficult country to live in as a Christian, trailing only Sudan, Somalia, Afghanistan and North Korea. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. However, in a statement earlier this month, the ministry denied reports that Bibi was banned from departing Pakistan and insisted she “is free to leave the country.” Even if Bibi could sneak out unscathed, to date she has nowhere to officially go. However, several sources tell Fox News that multiple countries, including the U.S., are working to ensure her safe exit from Pakistan. “We have been liaising with diplomats from a number of countries. In regards to the U.S., as we understand it America is working with many countries to ensure Asia Bibi’s safety and the family’s ultimate asylum in the West,” Chowdhry added. “But in the meantime, Asia Bibi is under the auspices of a Pakistani security detail – we hope that an international security detail can assume these responsibilities.” A State Department spokesperson could not comment on the matter but referred to a press conference in which officials reiterated their position that “religious freedom is universal,” and that the Bibi case has been closely followed. Only the worse may be yet to come. “It is highly likely that we will see additional protests when it is announced that Asia has been allowed to leave Pakistan and seek asylum,” Stark added. “But the important thing now is to keep the pressure on Pakistan to allow Asia and her family to seek asylum outside of the country. The Pakistani government will be under significant pressure from domestic extremists to reverse Asia’s acquittal and execute her."""	nonTerrorism	Religion
Holocaust scholar sues group that said he 'slandered' Poland	"A prominent Holocaust researcher said Friday that he is suing a Polish organization for libel after it waged a public campaign last year accusing him of slandering Poland's good name with his work exploring Polish violence against Jews during World War II. Historian Jan Grabowski, of the University of Ottawa in Canada, told The Associated Press he brought a lawsuit on Thursday against the Polish League Against Defamation, an organization allied with Poland's conservative ruling party. The head of the organization, Maciej Swirski, said he had not received formal notification of the suit yet and would only comment after he does. Last year, the league said Grabowski ""falsifies the history of Poland, proclaiming the thesis that Poles are complicit in the extermination of Jews."" ""During World War II, due to the demoralizing circumstances and German actions, it is true that vile-acting individuals could be found among Poles and Jews alike,"" the group wrote in a statement signed by dozens of Polish academics. ""Yet, we should remember that the objective of the Germans was also to 'eradicate the Polish nation' and 'completely destroy Poland.'"" The anti-defamation organization has been part of a broader effort under the government of the populist Law and Justice party to challenge research on Polish participation in the killing of Jews by Nazi Germany. Poland was under German occupation during World War II. ""What is important, from my point of view, is that the militant nationalists who nowadays hold sway in Poland be warned that they will be held to account, that they are wrong if they think that their outrageous statements and slanders will go unnoticed,"" Grabowski, who was born and attended university in Warsaw, told the AP. Official efforts under the Law and Justice government have included promoting the memory of the Polish gentiles who sheltered Jews during the war. Scholars who research Polish violence against Jews have faced censure and prosecution. The issue came under international scrutiny earlier this year when Polish lawmakers voted to make it illegal to blame the nation for Holocaust crimes. The law has since been amended to remove prison as a possible punishment for violators, though individuals can still be tried and fined. The measure created a rift with Israel and was also condemned by the U.S. Also Friday, the Polish ambassador to Germany, Andrzej Przylebski, accused Germans of frequently reducing World War II to the Holocaust ""as if Adolf Hitler was primarily or exclusively concerned with the murder of European Jews."" At a Berlin conference attended by the German foreign minister, Przylebski said Polish victims ""are almost completely forgotten or downplayed,"" according to a report from the Wirtualna Polska news portal. Grabowski's ""Hunt for the Jews: Betrayal and Murder in German-Occupied Poland"" documents the involvement of Poles in one rural area in finding and killing Jews who had escaped from ghettos and were trying to survive by hiding among gentiles. It was awarded the 2014 Yad Vashem International Book Prize for Holocaust Research. The book also sparked heated debates, and the scholar says he received death threats after its publication. After a German newspaper reviewed the book favorably, a far-right Polish website ran an article with a photograph of the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. The headline was ""Sieg Heil, Herr Grabowski, Three Times Sieg Heil."""	nonTerrorism	Religion
 Rohingya refugee camp quiet after Bangladesh postpone return	" Normal life returned to a Rohingya Muslim refugee camp in Bangladesh on Friday a day after government officials postponed plans to begin repatriating residents to Myanmar when no one volunteered to go. The checkpoints at the entrance to Unchiprang, one of the refugee camps near the city of Cox's Bazar, were temporarily left unguarded on Friday morning — a sign of easing tensions — as about 500 people crowded into a mosque for Friday prayers. One of the imams, Abdul Hakim, told the devotees that the government could not force Rohingya to go back without Myanmar guaranteeing them protection and civil rights, to which they raised their hands and replied, ""Amen."" More than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled to Bangladesh from western Myanmar's Rakhine state since August 2017 to escape killings and destruction of their villages by the military and Buddhist vigilantes that have drawn widespread condemnation of Myanmar. Bangladesh's refugee commission had planned to begin a voluntary repatriation process under a United Nations-brokered deal with Myanmar by escorting about 150 refugees across the border on Thursday. But some people on the repatriation list left their shanties and disappeared into other camps to avoid being sent home. After a demonstration involving about 1,000 Rohingya broke out at Unchiprang, Refugee Commissioner Abul Kalam said plans had been shelved because no refugees were willing to return. Kalam did not immediately return calls and messages on Friday, and it was unclear when the process would begin again. Nabi Hossain, 45, left his shanty at Unchiprang camp late Wednesday with his wife, Jamila Begum, and six other family members after noticing extra security at the camp. ""We heard they will come and take us. We were in a panic,"" Hossain said, adding that the family slept outside and didn't eat much because they didn't want a cooking fire to attract attention. They returned Thursday after hearing about the protest. ""If they allow us to have our rights, our citizenship, we want to go. But if we are forced, if our rights are not given, it is better to crush us under the wheels of cars or be thrown in a river,"" Hossain said. Not everyone who fled Unchiprang has returned. Johara, 30, a mother of four, said her husband left five days ago with their 6-year-old daughter, who was traumatized after witnessing Myanmar soldiers ransack her home village. ""My daughter is terrified. She told her father to take her with him,"" she said. Johara, who goes by one name, said her husband left to find his parents at another camp after she gave an interview to aid workers, and the family found out they were on the government's repatriation list. While Johara waited for her husband and daughter to return, activity at Unchiprang returned to normal, with little sign of the aid workers, journalists or government officials who had swarmed the camp earlier in the week."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Bishop reported missing amid Beijing-Vatican reconciliation	"A bishop who has resisted demands to join China's Communist Party-controlled church body has been taken into custody, a Catholic news service reported, despite recent moves by Beijing and the Holy See toward reconciliation. Asia News reported that Peter Shao Zhumin dropped out of sight several days ago, but gave no details other than saying he had been subjected to ""dozens of days of indoctrination as in the times of the Cultural Revolution,"" a reference to Mao Zedong's radical 1966-76 attack on traditional Chinese culture, religion and the intelligentsia. Shao was appointed by the pope in 2016 and posted to the southeastern city of Wenzhou, which has a large Christian community. Officials reached Friday by phone at the local religious affairs bureau, its department regulating the Catholic church and police headquarters said they had no knowledge of Shao's situation and refused to give their names. Shao's disappearance follows a breakthrough agreement to give China some say over the appointment of bishops that critics called a cave-in to the ruling party just as it is waging a sweeping crackdown on religion. Others characterized it as an imperfect but much-needed step toward uniting Catholics in the world's most populous country. The Vatican has long hoped to bring together China's 12 million Catholics who are divided between those worshipping in state-sanctioned churches and the underground priests and parishioners loyal to the pope, who are frequently detained and harassed. Details of the September agreement haven't been released, although analysts say the Vatican will retain the power to put forward candidates while Beijing will likely have the right to refuse them. Such moves are seen as a concession on the Vatican's part in the face of Beijing's assertion that it would not allow ""foreign forces"" to govern the country's faith groups. Under president and Communist Party leader Xi Jinping, the authorities have in recent months cracked down heavily on Protestants, Catholics, Muslims and Buddhists in the name of national security and the ""Sinosization"" of religion."	nonTerrorism	Religion
China says foreign concerns over Muslim rights unwarranted	"China said Thursday that 15 foreign ambassadors exceeded their diplomatic roles by issuing a letter expressing concern about the incarceration of hundreds of thousands of members of the country's Muslim minorities in re-education camps. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters at a daily briefing that it would be ""problematic"" if the diplomats were attempting to put pressure on local authorities in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, where the detentions have taken place. Hua said the letter violated the terms of the Vienna Convention governing diplomatic relations and that the ambassadors should not ""interfere in the internal affairs of other countries."" She said the letter was based on hearsay, despite widely distributed reports from detainees, relatives and officials documenting the sweeping and seemingly arbitrary detentions. ""As ambassadors, they are supposed to play positive roles in promoting mutual understanding, mutual trust and cooperation ... rather than making unreasonable requests to the countries where they are based,"" Hua said. The letter issued this week was signed by 15 Western ambassadors, including the Canadian, British, French, Swiss, European Union, German, and Australian envoys, according to the Reuters news agency. Hua's comments came as legislation is being brought by a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers who want President Donald Trump to help Chinese Muslims respond to the crackdown. Xinjiang's native Uighur and Kazakh ethnic groups are culturally, religiously and linguistically distinct from China's Han majority and the region has been home to a low-intensity rebellion against rule from Beijing. Many of the region's natives say their culture is under threat from Chinese policies aiming to assimilate them and that they face disadvantages in education and employment from Han migrants from other parts of China. Also on Thursday, China's Cabinet released a report entitled ""Protection and Development of Xinjiang Culture,"" that stressed the importance of adopting Mandarin Chinese among ethnic groups and referred to their Islamic faith as ""religious culture."" ""Xinjiang adheres to the historical tradition of the Sinosization of religion and actively adapts religion to socialist society,"" the report said."	nonTerrorism	Religion
 Germany: Merkel warns of modern racism on Kristallnacht 80th	"Chancellor Angela Merkel and Germany's main Jewish leader warned against tolerating modern-day anti-Semitism and racism as they marked the 80th anniversary Friday of the Nazis' anti-Jewish Kristallnacht, or ""Night of Broken Glass,"" pogrom. On Nov. 9, 1938, Jews were terrorized throughout Germany and Austria. At least 91 people were killed, hundreds of synagogues burned down, some 7,500 Jewish businesses vandalized, and up to 30,000 Jewish men arrested, many of whom were taken away to concentration camps. Twenty years after Germany's defeat in World War I and 5½ years after Adolf Hitler took power, state-driven anti-Semitism ""made it possible for many Germans to live out long-held resentments, to live out hatred and violence,"" Merkel said. ""With the November pogrom, the road to the Holocaust was mapped out."" Merkel spoke in a ceremony at a Berlin synagogue. The head of Germany's Central Council of Jews, Josef Schuster, said the building was set alight in 1938 and the blaze extinguished relatively quickly only so as not to endanger neighboring houses. Schuster said that, while the Nazis' SA and SS organizations were responsible for the pogrom, that already meant thousands of Germans took part — and the population's reaction ""gave the Nazis valuable information: barely anyone protested."" He added that, while modern-day attacks on Jews, migrants and Muslims can't be equated with the crimes of the Nazi era, ""I see it as a disgrace for our country that such things happen in Germany in 2018."" He assailed the far-right Alternative for Germany party, which he said has ""respect for nothing"" and which his organization didn't invite to Friday's event. The party entered Germany's parliament last year. ""Today, we are living once again in a time of far-reaching change,"" Merkel said. ""In such times, there is always a particularly great danger of those who react with supposedly simple answers gaining support."" Those answers, she said, are too often accompanied by a ""brutalization of language."" ""We are commemorating today with the promise that we will set ourselves strongly against attacks on our open and plural society,"" she said. ""We are commemorating in the knowledge that watching as lines are crossed and crimes are committed ultimately means going along with them."" In a separate speech to parliament on a day that also marked the 100th anniversary of the proclamation of a German republic after World War I and the 29th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier urged his compatriots to embrace an enlightened, ""democratic patriotism"" and reject aggressive nationalism that romanticizes the country's history. Evidence from post-war trials of perpetrators, such as one involving the Bavarian town of Treuchtlingen, shows that many ordinary Germans joined in the 1938 pogrom, some out of anti-Semitism, others using the riots as opportunities to settle personal grudges or to enrich themselves. The Treuchtlingen case was one of the first and among the largest of more than 1,000 post-war Kristallnacht trials in West German courts. A report by the U.S. military's Counter Intelligence Corps, which sent an observer to the 1946 proceedings, provides details about the nearly 60 defendants. The report from CIC special agent Erich Bendfeldt was declassified this year by the U.S. National Archives in response to an Associated Press Freedom of Information Act request. It shows that the Treuchtlingen synagogue was burned that night to the foundation walls. The fire department hosed down neighboring ""Aryan-owned"" buildings to protect them, while people rampaged through the town, mobbing Jewish homes, destroying property and looting. One middle-aged woman swung by the home of a Jewish family she owed money to and destroyed the ledgers, and also had enough time to bring gasoline to help torch the synagogue. The town's mayor took personal command of much of the destruction, while himself beating a respected Jewish doctor nearly to death. A 29-year-old engine driver also beat the doctor, poured a chamber pot over the head of a Jewish girl and forced her father at dagger-point to say ""Heil Hitler.""

Pope OKs beatification for US brother slain in Guatemala war	"Pope Francis has decreed that an American religious brother, James Miller, was killed out of hatred for the Catholic faith during Guatemala's civil war and can be beatified. Miller is the second American slain in Guatemala to move a step closer to possible sainthood in recent years. The Rev. Stanley Rother, who was gunned down during the Guatemalan conflict in 1981, was beatified as a martyr in his native Oklahoma last year. The Vatican said Thursday that Francis approved a decree recognizing that Miller, from Stevens Point, Wisconsin, died as a martyr on Feb. 13, 1982, in Huehuetenango, Guatemala. The 37-year-old Miller had been working with indigenous youths as a member of the De La Salle Christian Brothers when he was killed by three masked men. No one was ever arrested in the slaying. Miller's fellow brothers reported receiving warnings that Guatemala's armed forces intelligence unit, the G-2 death squad, was looking for them. A U.N. truth commission determined that some 245,000 people were killed or disappeared during Guatemala's 1960-1996 civil war, which pitted right-wing, U.S.-backed governments against leftist guerrillas and indigenous peoples. The vast majority of the killings were attributed to the army or to pro-government paramilitary groups. Being declared a martyr exempts Miller from the usual beatification requirement of having a miracle attributed to his intercession confirmed. However, such a miracle would be required for him to be declared a saint. A date for his beatification has not been set. Miller was one of more than a dozen people whose saint-making causes advanced during an audience Wednesday between Francis and the head of the Vatican's saint-making office. During the audience, Francis took the unusual step of decreeing that Michael Giedroyca, a lay member of the Order of St. Augustine during the 15th century, could be beatified without being declared a martyr or having a miracle attributed to his intercession. Giedroyc was born in Lithuania with a condition that resulted in short stature. He spent much of his life in Krakow, Poland, where he died in 1485. Francis has granted a handful of such ""equivalent"" decrees for well-known and revered saintly figures, including Pope John XXIII, whom Francis declared a saint alongside St. John Paul II in 2014. This story has been corrected to show the city where Miller was killed is spelled Huehuetenango, not Huehuetenago."	nonTerrorism	Religion
" Louis Farrakhan, in Iran, warns Trump a Mideast war possible"	"Minister Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, warned President Donald Trump not to pull ""the trigger of war in the Middle East . at the insistence of Israel,"" speaking Thursday while on a visit to Iran. The 85-year-old Farrakhan, long known for provocative comments widely considered anti-Semitic, criticized the economic sanctions leveled by Trump against Iran after America's pullout from the nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers. Farrakhan told journalists in Tehran that he is ""begging our president and the government that supports him to be very, very careful."" ""The war will trigger another kind of war which will bring China, Russia, all of the nations into a war,"" he said. ""The war will end America as you know it."" Farrakhan leads the Nation of Islam, a black separatist religious movement. The Nation has been largely closed off to outsiders, making it impossible even for those who follow the movement closely to gauge its strength. For Farrakhan, the height of his prominence came when he organized the 1995 Million Man March in Washington, a symbol of black pride and empowerment. Earlier on his trip to Iran, state television published a short video clip of Farrakhan trying to say ""Death to Israel"" in Farsi, a common chant at rallies in the decades after Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. He began to repeat it, but the crowd at Tehran University sitting at Farrakhan's event then substituted ""America"" for ""Israel,"" drawing laughter. After the video clip spread online, Farrakhan issued a statement saying: ""I never led a chant calling for death to America."" ""I asked a question about how to pronounce the chant in Farsi during my meeting with Iranian students and an examination of the video shows just that,"" he said. On Thursday, Farrakhan reacted angrily to an Iranian state television's request to repeat the chant. However, he kept his harshest words for Trump. ""It is your policies that are eroding trust for you in the world, favor for you in the world, and now you are pulling apart, confused,"" Farrakhan said, addressing Trump. ""If you do this, you will bring about — not the Iranian chant — you will bring about the death of the greatest nation that has been on this Earth in the last 6,000 years."""	nonTerrorism	Religion
UN rights resolution would condemn abuses against Rohingyas	"A draft U.N. resolution would strongly condemn the continuing ""gross human rights violations and abuses"" against Rohingya Muslims and urgently call on Myanmar's government to end discrimination and provide a path to citizenship for the embattled minority. The draft resolution, sponsored by the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation, more than 25 European countries and Canada, was officially circulated Wednesday. The General Assembly's human rights committee is expected to vote on the measure on Nov. 15. The draft expresses deep concern that violence against the Rohingya has forced over 723,000 people to flee to Bangladesh since August 2017. The Rohingya have long been treated as outsiders in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, even though their families have lived in the country for generations. Nearly all have been denied citizenship since 1982, effectively rendering them stateless, and they are also denied freedom of movement and other basic rights. The latest crisis began with attacks by an underground Rohingya insurgent group on Myanmar security personnel in August 2017 in northern Rakhine State. Myanmar's military responded with a brutal campaign and is accused of mass rape, killings and setting fire to thousands of homes. The draft resolution reiterates ""deep distress"" at reports that unarmed Rohingyas are still being subjected to excessive use of force and rights violations by Myanmar's military and security forces including killings and rapes. And it expresses ""deep concern"" at the continuing departure of the remaining Rohingya population as well as members of other minorities. The proposed resolution expresses ""grave concern"" at the findings of the U.N. fact-finding mission on Myanmar, which concluded that some top Myanmar military leaders should be prosecuted for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide against the Rohingya. It strongly condemns all rights abuses set out in the commission's report and calls for ""a full and independent investigation"" of human rights abuses against the Rohingya and other minorities. The draft notes Myanmar's establishment of an independent commission to investigate alleged violations, but stresses that it must work ""with independence, impartiality, transparency and objectivity in a credible way in line with international standards"" — unlike its previous national investigations. And it encouraged the government commission ""to seek support and expertise from the United Nations and the international community."" The proposed resolution would also reiterate an urgent call on Myanmar's government to take measures ""to address the spread of discrimination and prejudice and to combat the incitement of hatred against Rohingya Muslims and other persons belonging to minorities, including Kachin and Shan."" And the government should ""expedite efforts to eliminate statelessness and the systematic and institutionalized discrimination against members of ethnic and religious minorities,"" the draft says. The draft resolution also addresses the military's control over much of Myanmar's government. ""To sustain the democratic transition of Myanmar by bringing all national institutions, including the military, under the democratically elected civilian government,"" it says."	nonTerrorism	Religion
"Jewish students remember ""Night of Broken Glass"" in Berlin"	"Jewish students in Berlin on Wednesday marked the 80th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the ""Night of Broken Glass,"" when Nazis terrorized Jews throughout Germany and Austria. Some 30 students from the Jewish Traditional School lit candles and recited prayers at their school as Rabbi Yehuda Teichtal urged them to jointly overcome Germany's past by building a secure future for Jews in the country. ""This is the city where the Holocaust was planned and executed from,"" said Teichtal, a community rabbi and the head of the Jewish outreach group Chabad in the German capital. ""What better answer is there than that in this very city the students of the Jewish school from Berlin should jointly pray and light candles showing that the answer to darkness and the evil of the past is to create education for the present and the future,"" he said. Eighty years ago this week, on November 9, 1938, the Nazis killed at least 91 people, burned down hundreds of synagogues, vandalized and looted 7,500 Jewish businesses, and arrested up to 30,000 Jewish men, many of whom were taken to concentration camps. On Wednesday, students assembled under a maple tree in front of their school building. They prayed in Hebrew and German and lit six white candles to commemorate the synagogues that were burned down, as well as the 6 million who perished in the Holocaust. ""I lost a big part of my family ... my great-grandparents, their siblings, and therefore it is all very special for me,"" said 15-year-old student Clara Eljaschewitsch. ""It is sad ... I think a lot about it."" Kristallnacht — which got its name for the shattered glass from Jewish-owned store windows that covered German streets — is often referred to as the beginning of the Holocaust, but it would still be years before the Nazis formally adopted their ""Final Solution"" for the Jews of Europe, which would evolve into a policy of mass murder."	nonTerrorism	Religion
" 79 kidnapped Cameroon students freed, says church official"	"The 79 school children kidnapped by unidentified gunmen from a school in Cameroon have been released, but two of the three staff members abducted are still being held, said a church official. ""They were brought last night to one of our churches ... near Bamenda (the regional capital). They look tired and psychologically tortured,"" said the moderator of the country's Presbyterian Church, Fonki Samuel Forba. The students are between 11 and 17 years old. He pleaded with the kidnappers to ""free the staff still in their keeping."" The church leader said he had asked parents and guardians to take home all their children. ""It is unfortunate we have to close the school and send home 700 children,"" he said. ""Their security is not assured by the state and armed groups constantly attack and kidnap them."" He said the school previously had some students kidnapped which was resolved when the church paid a ransom of 2.5 million francs (about $4,000 dollars) to the armed gang. ""We can no longer continue,"" he said. Cameroon's northwest and southwest areas are beset by instability caused by English-speaking separatists. Fighting between the military and separatists increased after the government clamped down on peaceful demonstrations by English-speaking teachers and lawyers protesting what they said was their marginalization by Cameroon's French-speaking majority. Hundreds have been killed in the past year and the separatists have vowed to destabilize the regions as part of the strategy for creating a breakaway state, which they say will be called Ambazonia. They have attacked civilians who do not support their cause, including teachers who were killed for disobeying orders to keep schools closed. There have been kidnappings at other schools, but the group taken Sunday was the largest number abducted at one time in Cameroon's Anglophone regions. The separatists also have set fire to at least 100 schools and driven out students and teachers from buildings taken over as training grounds. The North West region governor Deben Tchoffo said this week that the government is providing adequate security for schools. ""I must insist that we have taken enough measures to protect schools, but we also need the assistance of all,"" said Tchoffo. ""People should inform the military whenever they see strange faces in their villages."" Tah Pascal, father of one of the kidnapped students, said he does not trust what the governor has said. ""How can he always talk of protection and security when our schools are torched every day, our children tortured and their teachers killed,"" said Pascal. ""This is done in spite of the presence of the military."" Parents interviewed said they were relocating their children to safer areas."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Italy working to help Pakistani Christian in blasphemy case	"Italy said Tuesday that it is working to help relocate the family of a Pakistani Christian woman acquitted eight years after being sentenced to death for blasphemy, amid warnings from her husband that the family's life is in danger in Pakistan. The Foreign Ministry said it was coordinating with other countries to ensure safety for Asia Bibi and her family. In a statement, the ministry said it was ready to act on whatever the Italian government might decide — an indication that an offer of asylum might be in the offing. Also Tuesday, a lawmaker in German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party called for Germany to grant Bibi refuge, after her husband Ashiq Masih appealed for help from the West to relocate the family. Bibi was convicted in 2010 of insulting Islam's prophet, but Pakistan's top court acquitted her last week. Protests by hardline Islamists prompted the government to impose a travel ban on Bibi until her case is reviewed. Bibi's case has been closely followed in Italy for years, and Pope Francis met earlier this year with her family in a show of solidarity. Even Italy's hardline, anti-migrant interior minister Matteo Salvini stressed that he would do ""all that is humanly possible"" to ensure Bibi and her family are safe, either in Italy or some other country. Salvini distinguished between Bibi and the tens of thousands of migrants who try to seek out a better life in Italy via smugglers' boats from Libya."	nonTerrorism	Religion
China dismisses criticism about mass detentions at UN	"China on Tuesday once again rejected criticism of its treatment of ethnic Muslims, telling the United Nations that accusations of rights abuses from some countries were ""politically driven."" At a regular U.N. review of the country's human rights record, China characterized the far west region of Xinjiang as a former hotbed of extremism that has been stabilized through ""training centers"" which help people gain employable skills. Former detainees of such centers, on the other hand, have described the facilities as political indoctrination camps where ethnic Uighurs, Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities are forced to renounce their faith and swear loyalty to the ruling Communist Party. The U.N. has previously said there are credible reports that as many as 1 million people are being held in this form of extrajudicial detention. At Tuesday's review — part of the Human Rights Council's periodic review process for every member state — the U.S., Canada, Japan and several other countries called on Beijing to address growing concerns over its treatment of Xinjiang Muslims. U.S. charge d'affaires Mark Cassayre urged China to ""immediately release the hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of individuals"" arbitrarily detained in the region. Representatives from both Canada and the U.K. said the country's human rights situation has ""deteriorated."" ""We will not accept the politically-driven accusations from a few countries that are fraught with biases,"" Le said. Yasim Sadiq, the Uighur mayor of Xinjiang's capital of Urumqi, told the session in Geneva that current policies are in line with the people's wishes. He repeated China's frequently cited claim that no terrorist attacks have occurred in the region for 21 months, and that ""trainees"" who were previously ""controlled by extremist ideology"" have since immersed themselves in cultural and athletic activities at the centers. Sadiq said visitors are always welcome in Xinjiang, but he did not address requests from several countries to allow independent UN observers inside the region. In recent years, Xinjiang has been outfitted with a high-tech security network , making police checkpoints and surveillance cameras ubiquitous throughout the region. Human Rights Watch said the U.N. review showed the contrast between Beijing's view of its human rights records and ""the grim realities."" ""China's efforts to whitewash its record have failed to convince a growing number of states who recognize China's deliberate and systemic abuses, and suppression of dissenting voices, can no longer be ignored,"" John Fisher, the organization's Geneva director, said in an emailed statement. About 500 people, including ethnic Uighurs but also pro-Tibet demonstrators, marched through Geneva before holding a boisterous, colorful rally at Geneva's landmark three-legged chair outside the U.N. offices. Chanting ""Shame on China"" and accusing its government of tyranny and ""terrorist"" repression, the demonstrators waved light-blue flags representing East Turkistan — some Uighurs' preferred name for Xinjiang — and held aloft photos of loved ones who have gone missing or were taken into custody by Chinese authorities."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Egypt says perpetrators of attack against Christians killed	"Egypt said Sunday that security forces have killed 19 militants in a shootout, including the gunmen suspected of killing seven Christians in an attack on pilgrims traveling to a remote desert monastery. The Interior Ministry, which oversees the police, said the militants were tracked to a hideout in the desert west of the central province of Minya, the site of Friday's attack, which also left 19 people wounded. It said the alleged militants opened fire when they realized they were being besieged by security forces. It did not say when the shootout took place. The ministry published photographs purporting to show the bodies of the slain militants, as well as rifles, shotguns and pistols. Other images showed the inside of a tent with the black banner of the Islamic State group — which claimed responsibility for Friday's attack — unfurled on the ground. An IS affiliate centered in the Sinai Peninsula has repeatedly targeted Christians, in part over their support for President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. El-Sissi led the 2013 overthrow of an elected but divisive Islamist president and has since waged a sweeping crackdown on dissent, jailing thousands of Islamists and other activists. Friday's attack was the second in as many years to target pilgrims on their way to the monastery of St. Samuel the Confessor, after a May 2017 assault left 29 dead. Christians make up about 10 percent of Egypt's 100 million people and have long complained of discrimination. They have accused police of negligence after this and other attacks, and say authorities often go easy on Muslim assailants after outbreaks of sectarian violence. They have found a measure of protection under el-Sissi which, according to Christian activists, did not extend to members of the ancient community in rural regions where radical Muslims whip up anti-Christian sentiments, often over the construction or restoration of churches or romantic relationships between Christians and Muslims. Pope Francis on Sunday decried the attack and invited the faithful in St. Peter's Square to pray with him for the seven people killed on Friday. He said he was praying for the ""pilgrims killed for the sole fact of being Christians,"" asking that those grieving be comforted. Addressing a meeting of youths in the Red Sea resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh, el-Sissi on Sunday sought to send out a message of reconciliation. He said Friday's attack pained all Egyptians, adding that his rule has been more tolerant of minorities than that of his predecessors. ""The state now is tasked with building churches for its citizens, because they (Christians) have the right to worship,"" he said, alluding to a 2016 law that, in theory, regulates the construction of churches and mosques without bias. ""If followers of other religions lived in Egypt, we would have built places of worship for them too,"" said the Egyptian leader who has been in office since 2014."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Bahrain opposition leader sentenced to life by high court	"A Shiite cleric who was a central figure in Bahrain's 2011 Arab Spring protests was sentenced to life in prison Sunday on spying charges. The ruling by the Supreme Court of Appeals came after Sheikh Ali Salman was acquitted of the charges by a lower court in June. Human rights groups and activists say the charges against him are politically-motivated and related to his work as a leading opposition figure. The verdict was issued just weeks before parliamentary elections are set to take place without the Al-Wefaq political group Salman once led. Al-Wefaq, which was the tiny Gulf nation's largest Shiite opposition bloc, was ordered dissolved in 2016 as part of a crackdown on dissent in the kingdom, which has a Shiite majority but is ruled by a Sunni monarchy. The state-run Bahrain News Agency reported the appellate court's decision Sunday without naming the defendants, saying three individuals were found guilty of the spying charges. Human Rights First, an activist group, confirmed the ruling refers to Salman. His co-defendants in the case— Sheikh Hassan Ali Juma Sultan and Ali Mahdi Ali al-Aswad— are also former al-Wefaq officials. The three faced charges of disclosing sensitive information to Qatar that could harm Bahrain's security in exchange for financial compensation. The state-run news agency said prosecutors presented recorded phone conversations as evidence. Last year, Bahrain state television aired the recorded calls between Salman and Qatar's then-Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani during the 2011 protests. Bahrain is one of four Arab countries that have been boycotting Qatar for over a year as part of a wider diplomatic dispute. A government-sponsored report on the 2011 protests and unrest noted Bahrain's opposition had accepted an idea for mediation by Qatar during the uprising, but Bahrain's government had rejected it. Salman's supporters say calls to Qatar were related to those efforts and that recordings were edited to suggest otherwise. Bahrain is home to the U.S. Navy 5th Fleet. The 2011 uprising there was quelled with help from Saudi and Emirati forces. Salman, in his early 50s, has long been targeted by Bahrain's government. In 1994, he was arrested, allegedly tortured and detained for months without trial before being deported and forced to live in exile for over 15 years, according to the United Nations. He is currently serving out a four-year sentence in another trial on charges he insulted the Interior Ministry, which oversees police, incited others to break the law and incited hatred against naturalized Sunni citizens, many of whom serve in Bahrain's security forces. Brian Dooley, a senior advisor at Human Rights First, said Sunday's ruling ""confirms there is now no tolerance for any dissent in Bahrain."" Amnesty International described the verdict as a ""travesty of justice"" and said Salman is being held ""solely for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression."""	nonTerrorism	Religion
Defense lawyer in Pakistan blasphemy case flees country	"The lawyer for a Christian woman acquitted of blasphemy charges after spending eight years on death row in Pakistan has fled the country, fearing for his safety, her brother said Saturday. James Masih said Asia Bibi's lawyer, Saiful Malook, left Pakistan, without providing further details. Malook's phone was switched off. Pakistan's top court acquitted Bibi on Wednesday and ordered her release in a move that infuriated the country's hard-line Islamists, who have held nationwide protests demanding her execution. The government reached deal with the Islamists overnight in which it agreed to impose a travel ban on Bibi while the case is reviewed. In return, the Islamists halted their protests, which had blocked roads and brought life to a standstill in parts of the country. Malook told The Associated Press earlier this week that he would have to leave Pakistan because the followers of hard-line cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi had threatened to kill him as well as the judges who acquitted Bibi. Blasphemy against Islam is punishable by death in Pakistan, and the mere rumor has caused lynchings. Islamists have made the blasphemy law a central rallying cry. Bibi was arrested in 2009 on allegations that she insulted Islam's Prophet Muhammad during an altercation with other farmworkers. Her family and lawyers deny she ever insulted Islam. Rights groups have called for Bibi's release and criticized the blasphemy law, saying it has been used to settle scores or abuse religious minorities. The court upheld the blasphemy law, but said there was not enough evidence to convict Bibi. Pakistan's Supreme Court has not been known to reverse its decisions, but court reviews typically take years. Bibi's ordeal looks set to continue until the review is completed. Bibi's family had expected her release by Thursday night. Her husband, Ashiq Masih, returned from Britain with their children in mid-October and was waiting for her release so that they could fly out of Pakistan. Though the family has not disclosed her destination, France and Spain have offered asylum."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Christian pilgrims to be buried one day after Islamic attack in Egypt	"Coptic Christians prepared to bury seven worshippers — including six from the same family — on Saturday, a day after Islamic militants ambushed three buses carrying pilgrims to a desert monastery in Egypt, wounding 19 others. A row of white coffins held the dead, which included a 15-year-old boy and 14-year-old girl, ahead of the funeral service. A priest and members of a Christian congregation prayed and chanted over the caskets. “I mourn with deep sorrow the martyrs who were killed today by treacherous hands which aim to undermine the solid fabric of the nation, and I wish speedy recovery for the injured,” President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi said in a statement on Friday obtained by the Washington Post. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert condemned the attack in a statement she posted to Twitter. The local Islamic State group affiliate, which spearheads militants fighting security forces in the Sinai Peninsula, claimed responsibility for the attack south of Cairo in a statement. It said the attack was revenge for the imprisonment by Egyptian authorities of ""our chaste sisters,"" without elaborating. The attackers opened fire mid-afternoon on two buses near the Monastery of St. Samuel the Confessor in Minya, 160 miles up the River Nile from Cairo, a church spokesman told Reuters. Reports say the militants were driving two or three SUV-type vehicles. “A number of masked men got out of them, took the mobile phones of the passengers and then shot all the men dead,” Bishop Aghathon Tala’at, a Christian community leader, told the Washington Post. “They were wearing military-like uniforms, survivors told me.” The Interior Ministry said police were pursuing the attackers, who fled the scene. The Islamic State has repeatedly vowed to go after Egypt's Christians as punishment for their support of el-Sissi. As defense minister, el-Sissi led the military's 2013 ouster of an Islamist president, whose one-year rule proved divisive. It has claimed responsibility for a string of deadly attacks on Christians dating back to December 2016. In Minya, the scene of Friday's attack, Christians constitute the highest percentage of the population — about 35 percent — of any Egyptian province. It's also in Minya where most acts of violence, like attacks on churches and Christian homes and businesses, take place. The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Pakistan's 'father of Taliban' cleric killed in knife attack	"Prominent Pakistani cleric Maulana Samiul Haq, also known as the ""father of the Taliban,"" was killed in a knife attack at his home in the garrison city of Rawalpindi on Friday, his family and police said. Haq's son, Hamidul Haq, said his father was alone in his bedroom when he was attacked by an assailant, who escaped undetected. ""My father has been martyred. He was alone at his home. His guard had gone out minutes before the attack and upon his return he saw my father in critical condition,"" he told reporters. Police say Haq, 81, was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died. Yousaf Shah, Haq's spokesman, told The Associated Press that neither the attacker nor their motive was yet known. Soon after his death, scores of Haq's supporters rioted, damaging shops and vehicles in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Haq's family appealed to his followers to remain peaceful. A well-known religious scholar with a large following among radical Islamists, Haq was the head of his faction of the Jamiat-e-Ulema Islam (JUI) party. Haq's sprawling Haqqani seminary taught many of Afghanistan's Taliban and thousands of other students a strict interpretation of Islam. Sirajuddin Haqqani, the deputy leader of the Haqqani network, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, was one of dozens of Taliban leaders who graduated from Haq's seminary, located in the conservative Khyber Pukhtunkhwa province on the border with Afghanistan. In recent weeks, dozens of Afghan clerics had appealed to Haq to use his influence with Afghanistan's Taliban to plot a path to peace that would end the 17-year-long war there. ""We lost a great scholar and religious leader today,"" said Khan in a statement from China where he is on an official visit. Khan was widely criticized for embracing Haq ahead of Pakistan's July elections that put the former cricketer-turned-politician in power. Khan's provincial government in Khyber Pukhtunkhwa donated millions of dollars to Haq's hard-line seminary. He defended the move saying he wanted to see Pakistan's thousands of madrassas, or religious schools, broaden their curriculum. Haq's funeral is expected to be held Saturday in Akora Khattak."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Islamic attack against Coptic Christians pilgrims kills at least 7 in Egypt	" Islamic militants on Friday ambushed two buses carrying Christian pilgrims on their way to a remote desert monastery south of the Egyptian capital of Cairo, killing seven and wounding up to 16, according to the Interior Ministry and security officials. Coptic Orthodox Church spokesman Boulos Halim said the death toll was likely to rise. Local church officials in Minya province where the attack took place put the death toll at 10, but the higher figure could not be confirmed. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which bore the hallmarks of Islamic militants who have for years been fighting security forces in the Sinai Peninsula and along Egypt's porous desert border with Libya. The extremist Islamic State group has repeatedly stated its intention to target Egypt's Christians as punishment for their support of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi who, as defense minister, led the military's 2013 ouster of an Islamist president, whose one-year rule proved divisive. SERIES OF ATTACKS IN EGYPT TARGETING COPTIC CHRISTIANS FORCES CHURCHES TO CLOSE El-Sissi wrote on his Twitter account that Friday's attack was designed to harm the ""nation's solid fabric"" and pledged to continue fighting terrorism. Friday's attack is the second to target pilgrims heading to the St. Samuel the Confessor monastery in as many years. The previous attack in May 2017 left nearly 30 people dead. It is also the latest in a deadly string of attacks that targeted churches in Cairo, the Mediterranean city of Alexandria and Tanta in the Nile Delta north of the capital. Those attacks, all claimed by the Islamic State group, left at least a 100 people dead and led to tighter security around Christian places of worship and other Church-linked facilities. The Interior Ministry, which oversees the police, and the security officials said Friday's attackers used secondary dirt roads to reach the buses carrying the pilgrims, who were near the monastery at the time of the attack. Only pilgrims have been allowed on the main road leading to the monastery since last year's attack. The security officials said the attackers opened fire on the two buses carrying pilgrims from Bani Suef and Sohag provinces, also south of Cairo. The Sohag bus had 28 pilgrims, of whom 9 were wounded, including two in serious condition. The Bani Suef bus carried 14 passengers, of whom seven were killed and the rest seriously wounded. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media. The Interior Ministry said police were pursuing the attackers, who fled the scene. Egypt's Christians, who account for some 10 percent of the country's 100 million people, complain of discrimination in the Muslim majority country. Christian activists say the church's alliance with el-Sissi has offered the ancient community a measure of protection but failed to end frequent acts of discrimination that boils over into violence against Christians, especially in rural Egypt. In Minya, the scene of Friday's attack, Christians constitute the highest percentage of the population - about 35 percent - of any Egyptian province. It's also in Minya where most acts of violence, like attacks on churches and Christian homes and businesses take place. Christians there often accuse the local police of being soft on Muslims accused of attacking Christians and, in their pursuit of keeping the peace between the two communities, insist on resolving differences through tribal-like reconciliation meetings rather than apply the law."	nonTerrorism	Religion
 Protests in Pakistan delay release of Christian woman	"The release of a Christian woman in Pakistan who was acquitted eight years after being sentenced to death for blasphemy was apparently delayed Friday, after talks failed between the government and radical Islamists who want her publicly hanged. Also, a lawyer representing a local cleric who had raised the initial blasphemy charges against Asia Bibi petitioned the Supreme Court on Thursday to reverse its acquittal. The top court in a landmark decision on Wednesday overturned Bibi's 2010 conviction of insulting Islam's Prophet Muhammad. Since then, Islamists have blocked highways and damaged or set-fire to dozens of vehicles to pressure the government to stop her release from an undisclosed detention facility. Islamists were to hold nationwide rallies after Friday's prayers, stoking fears violence. Pakistan shut down schools and colleges after radical cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi, the leader of Tehreek-e-Labbaik party, announced that ""talks"" between his deputies and the government about Bibi's fate had failed. Before dawn Friday, Rizvi told an emotionally-charged rally in the eastern city of Lahore that one of the government negotiators threatened his deputies during the talks that security forces will ruthlessly kill them if they did not disperse peacefully. He asked his supporters to continue sit-ins as authorities summoned paramilitary troops to restore order. ""We are ready to die to show our love for the prophet,"" he said. Rizvi's envoys had demanded that Bibi be barred from leaving the country but Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry rejected the demand, saying the government will not accept any dictates. Ghulam Mustafa, a lawyer representing a provincial cleric in Punjab who had filed the initial blasphemy charges against Bibi, petitioned the Supreme Court, requesting the judges review her acquittal. The court has set not dates to take up the petition, but Bibi's release could be further delayed by the process. Pakistan's Supreme Court has not been known to reverse its decisions but court reviews typically take years. Authorities say they have stepped up security near an undisclosed detention facility where Bibi is being held for her safety. On Thursday, prison officials said two inmates were arrested last month for planning to kill Bibi by strangling her. They said the men were still being questioned. Bibi's family had expected her release by Thursday night. Her husband, Ashiq Masih, returned from Britain with their children in mid-October and was waiting for her release so that they can fly out of Pakistan. Though the family has not disclosed the country of her destination, France and Spain have offered asylum. Bibi's acquittal has posed a challenge to the government of Pakistan's new Prime Minister Imran Khan, who came to power this summer partly by pursuing the Islamist agenda. Khan condemned the Islamists on Wednesday after cleric Afzal Qadri urged supporters to kill the three judges who acquitted Bibi, revolt against army chief Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa and overthrow Khan's government. Military's spokesman Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor said Friday the army was exercising restraint, to give a chance for a peaceful resolution. He asked demonstrators to refrain from violence and await the outcome of the review petition to the Supreme Court. ""Let this legal process be completed first,"" he told state-run Pakistan Television. However, over 2,000 Islamists continued blocking a key road linking the capital, Islamabad, with the garrison city of Rawalpindi on Friday, causing traffic jams. Hundreds also blocked another key motorway, linking Islamabad with other major cities. Bibi was arrested in 2009 after she was accused of blasphemy following a quarrel with two fellow female farm workers who refused to drink from a water container used by a Christian. A few days later, a mob accused her of insulting Islam's prophet, leading to her 2010 conviction. Bibi's family has always maintained her innocence and says she never insulted the prophet. Bibi's case has drawn international attention and also put Pakistan's controversial blasphemy laws into focus again. The charge of blasphemy carried the death penalty in this majority Muslim nation and critics say it is often used to settle feuds and arguments."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Trump's visit to Pittsburgh's Tree of Life Synagogue shows he is dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism	"President Trump’s visit Tuesday to the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh – where an anti-Semitic gunman murdered 11 Jews gathered in prayer Saturday – was an important gesture that symbolized national mourning and unity in the face of a horrific tragedy. The visit showed President Trump’s deep concern for the welfare of America’s Jewish community and followed a long tradition of presidential visits to the scenes of mass murders and natural disasters. On occasions like this, presidents of both parties have led the nation in mourning terrible losses of American lives. In another gesture, President Trump ordered that flags at federal buildings around the nation to fly at half-staff this week in respect for the dead at the synagogue. In addition to the 11 Jews who were murdered, six people – including four courageous police officers – were wounded in the attack. The president’s visit to the Pittsburgh synagogue – accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner – drew criticism by some and brought out about 1,000 protesters. Yet I’m sure that many Americans Jews felt, as I felt, that the visit by President Trump and members of his family was deeply heartening and an acknowledgment that the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history cried out for the presence of our nation’s leader to show that hatred of Jews has no place in our country and is un-American. President Trump’s visit was not a surprise at this painful time. He – and the Republican Party as a whole – have always condemned anti-Semitism, supported the Jewish community, and been dependable friends and allies of Israel. The attack on the Tree of Life synagogue has called forth two very different responses. One is an outpouring of comfort, solidarity, and compassion from Americans of every religion and background. That is the best possible response in the face of the anguish we feel at this sad time. As an American Jew, who feels pain whenever Jews anywhere are hurt, I am grateful for the sympathy and friendship I have received from non-Jewish friends, neighbors and even strangers on the street in the wake of the mass murder at the synagogue. President Trump should be acknowledged for the leadership he has shown in his responses to the synagogue attack. His strong statements condemning anti-Semitism demonstrated a true understanding of the nature of the evil that took those precious lives in Pittsburgh. The president called out anti-Semitism as a poison that “must be condemned and confronted everywhere and anywhere it appears.” President Trump sent two senior members of his administration, Jason Greenblatt and Avi Berkowitz, to Pittsburgh. In addition, the president and his family members were accompanied on their visit to the synagogue by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. Ron Dermer. Anti-Semitism is an ancient evil that sadly rears its ugly head in many parts of the world. In America, we’ve seen President Trump and the Republican Party loudly and consistently reject anti-Semitism and those who espouse it, including white supremacist fringe candidates who have tried to run for office as Republicans. Such people have no place in the Republican Party. We’ve seen President Trump implement a pro-Israel agenda that goes beyond the historic diplomatic, intelligence and defense cooperation of our strong and very important strategic alliance with Israel. President Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moved the U.S. embassy there. That’s something that previous American presidents had promised – but never done. In ways large and small, too many to list, President Trump has deepened and strengthened the U.S.-Israel relationship that is so beneficial to both countries. This makes it all the more painful and disturbing to see the second response to the Pittsburgh shooting that has filled the mainstream media and social media – a flood of bitter, hateful, politically motivated rhetoric trying to assign the blame for the murder of 11 American Jews to our president. Assigning blame to President Trump for the scourge of anti-Semitism that has infected society for millennia – and scoring political points on the graves of 11 murdered Jews – is reprehensible. Anti-Semitism is not new. It is one of the oldest hatreds in the world and has caused the deaths of millions of people. And it still kills today. While the attack in Pittsburgh is the largest loss of life in an anti-Semitic attack on American soil, it is not the first such deadly incident. Between 1990 and 2015, a dozen people were killed in six anti-Semitic shooting attacks. And there have been many more anti-Semitic attacks that left American Jews injured, but thankfully still alive. These terrible attacks did not start when Donald Trump became president. Pretending that he is somehow responsible for anti-Semitism in America makes it much harder to confront hatred of Jews and stop it. Anti-Semitism is not a feature of the Republican Party or the mainstream right. Nor is it usually found among mainstream Democrats and independents. Anti-Semitism is incubated at the extremes, where neo-Nazis and leftwing progressive radicals live, and where religious, racial and ethnic prejudice sow hatred against the “other.” Ever since our forefather Abraham proclaimed the One God in biblical times, Jews have been the chief “other” of history. When extremism is on the rise, our community suffers. When leftwing organizations like Bend the Arc and J Street attempt to blame President Trump for the deaths in Pittsburgh, they contribute to hatred and division precisely when compassion and unity are needed. They should appeal to the best in our community and our country to stand together against hate, not to seek political gain from the murders of Jews. Sadly, we can’t go back and erase the terrible events that turned the Tree of Life synagogue into a crime scene of death. But we can come together as Americans – Jews and non-Jews alike – to speak with one voice and to act with one purpose: to condemn anti-Semitism in unison and stop it from destroying any more lives."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Spain says Vatican to help with discreet reburial of Franco	" The Spanish government said Tuesday that the Vatican has agreed to jointly find ways to prevent the remains of late Spanish dictator Gen. Francisco Franco from being reburied under a central Madrid cathedral after they are exhumed from a glorifying mausoleum. Relatives of Franco want to reinter his embalmed body in a family crypt under Almudena Cathedral if the government delivers on a promise to remove it from the Valley of the Fallen, a self-aggrandizing mausoleum outside of the Spanish capital where he was interred upon his death in 1975 along the remains of some 34,000 fighters from both sides of the Civil War. Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo said the Vatican's State Secretary Pietro Parolin had agreed during a Monday meeting to ""jointly find a solution that obviously can't be the Almudena"" cathedral. The two sides agreed that while Franco's remains need to be relocated to a place ""with dignity,"" the government ""must guarantee in all Spanish territory that Franco is not praised."" The Spanish government and Catholic authorities in Spain had previously said they couldn't oppose the proposal from Franco's heirs because the sepulcher under Madrid's main church is owned by the family, which bought it from the church for 30,000 euros ($34,000) more than two decades ago. But Tuesday's remarks by Calvo, the official in charge of the exhumation, suggested a new turn in the center-left Spanish administration's efforts to bring Franco out of the spotlight. The attempts have been opposed mainly by supporters of Franco's authoritarian regime and his heirs. The Franco family crypt under the Spanish capital's cathedral is centrally located among major tourist hotspots and near the Royal Palace where Franco used to address ecstatic crowds rallying in support of his regime. Opponents worry that having the general's remains there would make Madrid a pilgrimage destination for extreme right groups and others nostalgic for Franco's authoritarian rule."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Walk to heaven': Shiite pilgrims trek to Iraq's Karbala	"Millions of Shiite Muslims from around the world are making their way this week to their sect's holy shrines in the Iraqi city of Karbala, a pilgrimage that is as much about community as it is about religion. The shrines are of two revered Shiite imams: Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, and his half-brother Abbas. The annual commemoration, called Arbaeen, draws more pilgrims each year — according to Iraqi figures — than the hajj in Saudi Arabia, a pilgrimage required once in a lifetime of every Muslim who can afford it and is physically able to make it. Pilgrims stream toward Karbala on foot from the cities of Najaf, 70 kilometers (45 miles) away, Baghdad, 90 kilometers (55 miles) to the north, and other places farther afield, resting along the way in tents lined with foam mattresses and fleece blankets. ""Our fathers and our grandfathers walked to Karbala, and God willing, our children will, too,"" said Karrad Karim, a 24-year-old pilgrim journeying with four friends from Baghdad. They brought with them large flags bearing devotional sayings to the Shiite saints, but little in the way of supplies for the four-day journey. That's because along the roads, stalls set up by charities, mosques, and devotional groups see to it that no traveler goes hungry. Cooks prepare vast amounts of stewed lamb, grilled fish, fresh bread, and rice for the pilgrims, refusing payment for the meals. The pilgrimage, known in Arabic as the Ziara, marks the 40th day of mourning of the anniversary of Hussein's 7th century death at the hands of the Muslim Umayyad forces in the Battle of Karbala, during the tumultuous first century of Islam's history. Hussein was seen by his followers as the rightful heir of the prophet's legacy. When he refused to pledge allegiance to the Umayyad caliphate, he was killed in the battle, cementing the schism between Sunni and Shiite Islam. Hussein's half-brother Abbas was also killed in the battle. Modern depictions of Hussein, stitched on banners displayed along the pilgrimage, show him with blood on his brow and bearing a Christ-like countenance. But the pilgrims' mood is not all somber. Spirits are high as they approach Karbala, and improve further upon arrival, with generous helpings of dates and tea. ""This is a walk to heaven,"" said Alaa Dadi, 45, who was making his way with his wife and three children. Sunnis outnumber Shiites by a wide margin among the world's estimated 1.5 billion Muslims, and Shiite rituals are far less known. The hajj is considered one of the five pillars of Islam, and an obligation for all Muslims — Sunni and Shiite. The Ziara is voluntary and holds little significance in Sunni tradition. In recent years, the Iraqi government says Karbala received 10-20 million visitors during the event, with many Shiite pilgrims coming from Iraq. No figures have yet been released for 2018. This year's pilgrimage is the first since Iraq's government declared victory over the Islamic State group in January, but the threat of insurgent attacks still lingers. The militant group has deliberately targeted Shiites in Iraq and elsewhere to destabilize the region. Thousands of Iraqi soldiers and special police forces have been deployed to protect the pilgrims along the routes. Iranian religious affairs official Hussein Zulfighari said 1.7 million Iranians had already crossed into Iraq for the pilgrimage, and predicted the number could reach 2 million by the event's climax on Tuesday. Zulfighari, quoted in Iran's Fars news agency, said the visitors include 50,000 Afghan Shiites living in Iran. Muhammad Thiqawi, 57, from Iran, said he was initially hesitant about making the journey this year. A month ago, protesters in Iraq's southern city of Basra burned down Iran's Consulate over what they felt was the country's undue influence over Iraqi affairs. Iran, the region's Shiite power, exerts considerable sway over Iraqi politics through its support for Shiite parties and government-backed militias. But, he said, ""the Iraqis hosted us in their homes and welcomed us. They said Iranians are our friends and guests of Hussein."" On his child's stroller, he pinned a poster of the two countries' flags. Ali al-Alizi, 35, traveled from Qatif, a Shiite province in eastern Saudi Arabia that has been the target of repression by the Sunni monarchy. Lord Maurice Glasman, a Labour peer in Britain's House of Lords who was raised Jewish, said he came at the encouragement of his Iraqi friends to better understand the country that defeated the Islamic State group's insurgency. ""Politically, ethically, spiritually, it has been an extremely elevated visit,"" said Glasman, who arrived in Karbala on Sunday, after walking several days from Najaf. The hajj saw 2.4 million pilgrims this year but Saudi authorities regulate the tradition tightly, driving up costs for pilgrims and depriving it of some of the spontaneity seen in the Ziara. For many Muslims who cannot afford to go on the hajj or cannot get the Saudi visa, the Ziara is a satisfying alternative. ""The hajj is required by God, but the Ziara is voluntary,"" said Sayyid Abdelamir Mousawi, 46. ""Those who go do it out of love."" Issa reported from Baghdad. Associated Press writer Maamoun Youssef in Cairo contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Religion
"Hate preacher Anjem Choudary must take UK anti-extremism course after prison release, report says"	"Notorious Islamist preacher Anjem Choudary must complete what is being described as ""Britain's first compulsory deradicalization"" program as part of his probation following his early release from prison, The Times of London reported late Sunday. Choudary, 51, served less than half of a five-and-a-half-year prison sentence for encouraging support for the Islamic State terror group. He was released from the high-security Belmarsh prison in southeast London on Oct. 19 but will be subject to strict supervision. As part of the course, The Times reports, Choudary is required to receive ""mentoring and theological 'advice.'"" If he does not attend the sessions, the paper reports that he will be returned to prison to serve out the remainder of his sentence. The onetime solicitor from east London is also expected to wear an electronic tag, face a nighttime curfew and be barred from contacting anyone who has been charged with extremist-related offenses unless he receives prior approval from authorities. His name has also been added to a United Nations sanctions list, which means the U.K. government could freeze his assets and bar him from traveling. According to The Times, approximately 100 people passed through the so-called ""desistance and disengagement programme"" (DDP) last year as part of a trial period. The paper reports 230 extremists -- including one-time ISIS fighters returning to the U.K. from Syria -- are expected to take part in the program by June. Some returning fighters who cannot be prosecuted due to lack of evidence must take part in the program to be allowed back into the country. Choudary has been one of the most high-profile faces of radical Islam in Britain for years, leading groups under names including al-Muhajiroun, Islam4UK and Muslims Against Crusades. Several people who attended Choudary's rallies and events have been convicted of violent attacks, including the two Al Qaeda-inspired killers who ran over British soldier Lee Rigby and stabbed him to death in 2013. Until he was charged under the Terrorism Act, the firebrand preacher gained attention for headline-grabbing activities that provoked outrage but were protected by the law. They included protesting outside the U.S. Embassy on the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks and burning memorial poppies on Britain's annual Remembrance Day honoring slain service members. However, he ran into trouble in 2014 after his name appeared on an oath circulating online that declared the legitimacy of the ""proclaimed Islamic Caliphate State."" Choudary said the oath was made without his knowledge. Choudary was convicted in 2016 and qualified for early release because of time served before his conviction.

"Pittsburgh synagogue shooting: I prayed at the Tree of Life Synagogue, now turned into a scene of death"	"For many years, I attended services to pray at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, mere blocks from my home. I know the families of some of the 11 people shot and killed at the synagogue Saturday by an anti-Semitic gunman. Like many, I have been shaken to my core by this harrowing act of terrorism, but also by the immediate politicization of the tragedy in the news media. Despite what you may hear, the motivations of this sick killer lie far deeper than President Trump’s rhetoric or gun control. Before opening fire, the gunman reportedly declared that “all Jews must die.” This phrase is especially terrifying in light of our people’s macabre history. The Jewish people have been the victims of oppression since biblical times. Millennia of terror against innocent people came to a climax in the Holocaust, when 6 million Jews – two-thirds of the Jews in Europe – were systematically slaughtered by the Nazis. My great-grandfathers, who lived in Ukraine, all perished on the battlefields of World War II or in concentration camps. My grandparents and parents faced constant anti-Semitism, even fearing for their lives, while living under the Soviet regime. Almost all of my Jewish friends can share similar stories about their families. Our people know tragedy almost ubiquitously. In the immediate reporting after the synagogue massacre Saturday, I heard endless speculation on guns, and listened to partisans eager to highjack this tragedy to further their gun-control agenda. The Jewish people have been at the receiving end of all sorts of weapons for thousands of years – from knives, swords and arrows in ancient times to guns, bombs and poison gas. Anti-Semitism and murder did not start or end with the assault rifle. The poison used in Nazi gas chambers – Zyklon B – was created based on research by Fritz Haber, a German Jew and chemist who was a winner of the Nobel Prize. He couldn’t have imagine that the poison gas would be used during World War II to kill his fellow Jews in gas chambers, after Jews were declared enemies of the state. We have seen anti-Semitism, and xenophobia in general, take root in many nations, with devastating consequences. We are always vigilant and cautious to condemn it at every term. A few years ago I had the life-changing opportunity of visiting the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp in Poland. The most striking feature to me was the sheer size of the barracks, stretching for miles. In contrast, the ovens used for burning the bodies were small and could only fit a few at a time. It is impossible to imagine the extent of hatred and indoctrination required to convince so many Germans, and devote so many resources, to a mass slaughter of these proportions. In my Jewish Day School in Squirrel Hill, the Pittsburgh neighborhood where the Saturday shooting took place, students collected 6 million pop tabs in order to visualize the loss of 6 million lives. It took students at our school decades to find so many pop tabs; the Nazis killed 6 million Jews in just a few years. Too often, I’ve heard the terms “Nazis” and “fascists” used to describe political opponents in our country. Some on the left have used the terms to describe President Trump and Republicans. This is absurd. Real fascism is marked by a suspension of due process; the hijacking of government, media and the collective conscience; and the killing of innocents. President Trump and the Republicans are not fascists. In fact, the alleged Pittsburgh shooter had explicitly railed against the president due to Trump’s acceptance of Jews. In Nuremberg in 1935, the Nazis passed their first discriminatory laws against Jews. Some 10 years and 50 million deaths later, the surviving Nazi leadership was put on trial in the same city. The Nuremberg trials opened with this statement: “Civilization cannot tolerate these crimes being ignored, because it cannot survive their being repeated.” And yet, genocides, acts of terror and innocent deaths have been repeated since. Our community prays for an end to the endless cycle of violence, but those prayers won’t be taking place at our beloved synagogue for now, because it has been turned into a crime scene."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Pope wraps up synod on youth claiming persecution over abuse	"Pope Francis wrapped up a monthlong meeting of bishops dedicated to young people by saying Saturday the Catholic Church was being ""persecuted"" and ""dirtied"" by accusations from the devil — an apparent reference to claims that he covered up for a sexual predator that have thrown his papacy into turmoil. The Argentine pope made the comments to about 250 bishops, 30 young people and a handful of nuns who had just approved a 60-page final document at the close of a synod on how the church can better minister to today's youth. The sex abuse scandal, as well welcoming gays into the church and giving women a greater say in decision-making, were major topics of debate during the synod and featured in the final document. Those issues were also the ones that received the most contested votes as bishops voted ""placet"" or ""non placet"" — yay or nay — on each of the 167 paragraphs. While every paragraph passed with far more than the two-thirds vote necessary, one referencing ""sexual inclinations"" and the need to accompany gays received the most no votes, at 65. One calling for women to have a greater recognition and say in the church — and lamenting the ""absence"" of the female perspective — received 30 no votes. No woman was allowed to cast a ballot at the meeting. On abuse, the bishops stopped short of issuing a straight-forward communal apology for the decades of sex abuse and cover-up committed by priests and their superiors. While that section was entitled ""Seek Pardon,"" the text voted on by bishops said merely that no amount of repentance can heal the trauma caused to victims. Thirty bishops voted against it. Delegates have said that many bishops, particularly from Africa, rejected the emphasis placed on the abuse issue during the meeting, which unfolded as the Catholic hierarchy in the U.S., Chile and elsewhere is once again under fire for its botched handling of the scandal. Francis himself has been drawn into the fray after a former Vatican ambassador accused him and a long line of Vatican officials before him of covering up for a now-disgraced ex-cardinal, Theodore McCarrick. Francis removed McCarrick as a cardinal in July after a U.S. church investigation determined an accusation he molested a teen-age altar boy was credible. In his concluding remarks to the synod, Francis appeared to be once again referring to the claims by Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano that he had rehabilitated McCarrick from restrictions placed on him by the previous pope. Francis acknowledged that there were sinners all around, but he insisted that the church itself was holy and must be protected from attacks and ""another type of persecution: continuous accusations that seek to dirty the church."" Francis said the devil was behind the accusations and said now was the time to come to the defense of the church, which he referred to as ""mother."" ""It's a difficult moment because the accuser, through us, is attacking the mother,"" he said. ""And you don't touch the mother."""	nonTerrorism	Religion
"Defaming Muhammad does not fall under purview of free speech, European court rules"	"The freedom of speech does not extend to include defaming the prophet of Islam, the European Court of Human rights ruled Thursday. The Strasbourg-based ECHR ruled that insulting Islamic prophet Muhammad “goes beyond the permissible limits of an objective debate” and “could stir up prejudice and put at risk religious peace.” The court’s decision comes after it rejected an Austrian woman’s claim that her previous conviction for calling Muhammad a pedophile, due to his marriage to a 6-year-old girl, violated her freedom of speech. The ECHR ruled Austrian courts had “carefully balanced her right to freedom of expression with the right of others to have their religious feelings protected.” The woman, in her late 40s and identified only as E.S., claimed during two public seminars in 2009 that Muhammad’s marriage to a young girl was akin to “pedophilia.” According to Islamic tradition, the marriage between Muhammad and a 6-year-old girl was consummated when she was 9 years old and he was about 50. The Austrian woman stated in her seminars that Muhammad “liked to do it with children” and “… A 56-year-old and a 6-year-old? … What do we call it, if it is not pedophilia?” A Vienna court convicted her in 2011 of disparaging religious doctrines, ordering her to pay a $547 fine, plus legal costs. The ruling was later upheld by an Austrian appeals court. The woman argued her comments fell within her right of freedom of expression and that religious groups must tolerate criticism. She also argued her comments were intended to contribute to public debate and not designed to defame Muhammad. The ECHR said the Austrian court’s decision “served the legitimate aim of preserving religious peace.” The court also said the woman’s comments were not objective, failed to provide historical background and had no intention of promoting public debate.

Franco heirs take upper hand in fight over dictator's body	"The Spanish government's latest attempt to rid the country of Gen. Francisco Franco's ghost could backfire if relatives reinter the late dictator's embalmed body under Madrid's cathedral. The Franco family crypt by Almudena Cathedral is centrally located among the Spanish capital's tourist hotspots. Opponents worry that having the general's remains there would make Madrid a pilgrimage destination for extreme right groups and others nostalgic for Franco's authoritarian rule. The government was aiming for the opposite when it decided earlier this year to have Franco exhumed from his crucifix-topped resting place in the Valley of the Fallen, a self-aggrandizing mausoleum he had built with forced labor as a tribute to ""national reconciliation."" Some 34,000 people, including fighters from both sides of the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War — the one initiated and won by Franco — and unidentified victims of the dictator's long rule preceded him below ground at the vast monument 30 miles from Madrid. Anonymous mass graves around the country hold at least 114,000 more victims of the war. The center-left government of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez put forward a proposal earlier this year to remove what it regards as the inappropriate presence of the dictator's remains in the western democracy that emerged after he died in 1975. But Franco's heirs appear to have reclaimed the upper hand in the long battle over the dictator's place in Spanish history. Their proposal to have him reburied at the crypt under the cathedral is weakening the government's resolve and emboldening the defenders of Franco's 36-year tenure. ""If Franco's remains end up in the Madrid cathedral, God forbid it, the pilgrimage to see him is going to be tremendous,"" Francisco Franco National Foundation President Juan Chicharro told The Associated Press. ""You can only reach the Valley of the Fallen by car on a highway and with traffic jams, but to the cathedral you can easily get by subway."" The government ""doesn't know what they are playing with,"" Chicharro added. ""The dead should be left to rest in peace."" While Chicharro's foundation is committed to preserving Franco's legacy, a vast majority of Spaniards would prefer to reassess his rule with more objectivity or to close altogether that chapter of their country's history. During the four decades of Francoism, his regime is thought to have abducted thousands of children, suppressed political dissent and isolated Spain before slowly opening up its economy in the 1960's. In light of the curve ball thrown by Franco's heirs, many are questioning how well the government thought through the exhumation idea. An official in Madrid's Roman Catholic Archdiocese who spoke anonymously because of the sensitivity of the issue said government officials were told about the cathedral sepulcher the Franco family purchased more than two decades ago for the equivalent of ""around 30,000 euros."" The general's daughter and son-in-law already rest in the chamber, which has room for ""one or even two more bodies,"" the church official said. The entire Almudena crypt, a late 19th century temple conceived as both a burial vault and the cathedral's foundation, is easily missed by many tourists despite its artistic appeal. Inside the neo-Romanesque structure are 558 Portuguese granite columns and a 13th-century artwork thought to be oldest representation of the Virgin Mary in Madrid. The number of curious visitors has increased since the living Francos informed the government of where they planned to put the general's remains next. On a recent visit, fresh carnations and roses with the yellow and red colors of the Spanish flag decorated the marble slab marking the family tomb, one of 1,500 belonging to church donors. ""The government must be ill-advised because this is ridiculous,"" said Paco Artola, a retired Madrid resident who roamed the cavernous crypt looking for the Francos' slab. ""All they are going to achieve is putting him next to where he always wanted to be, at the very center of the power."" In recent remarks, Spanish cabinet members have dropped the end of the year deadline that was promised to remove Franco from his current grave. And both the government and the Spanish Catholic Church acknowledge they can do little from a legal perspective to keep his body out of the cathedral. ""Naturally, like with any other Christian, the family has the right to bury him wherever they consider appropriate,"" Madrid's archbishop, Cardinal Carlos Osoro, said earlier this month. ""This is not a problem of the archbishop or the Church; it's a question that needs to be resolved by the government and the family."" The official in charge of the exhumation, Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo, is heading to the Vatican on Monday for talks with the Pope's right hand, State Secretary Pietro Parolin. Asked this week whether she would request the Vatican's mediation, Calvo said ""there were many issues to discuss"" in the meeting. The Vatican said it was an ""ordinary"" meeting with no specified agenda. Meanwhile, negotiations are underway to persuade Franco's nine grandchildren to agree to a less conspicuous burial site, in the El Pardo cemetery, where Franco's wife was buried in 1988. The Franco Foundation's Chicharro said Sanchez's administration has stepped up ""pressure"" by making ""all kinds of promises of dignified treatment and security"" for the dictator's remains. ""I see this pretense as an act of pure and simple revenge, also deeply hurting the feelings of millions of Spaniards,"" Chicharro said, warning that his foundation would see any intervention by Catholic hierarchy to thwart the heirs as ""treason."" ""I think more than one within the Church would be remorseful,"" he said. ""They would be cooperating with an attempt to humiliate somebody to whom the Catholic Church in Spain owes its own existence."""	nonTerrorism	Religion
Sinead O’Connor has converted to Islam	"Sinead O’Connor announced she has converted to Islam and changed her name to the Arabic word for “martyr.” Mom-of-four O’Connor was ordained a priest by a Catholic sect during the 1990s. But the Irish singer has changed faiths and her name to Shuhada Davitt. Sinead, who has struggled with mental health issues, told fans: “This is to announce that I am proud to have become a Muslim. “This is the natural conclusion of any intelligent theologian’s journey. “All scripture study leads to Islam. Which makes all other scriptures redundant. “I will be given (another) new name. It will be Shuhada.” Last Friday she posted a video of herself singing an Islamic call to prayer. Sinead changed her name last year to Magda Davitt, saying in an interview that she wanted to be “free of parental curses.” In the past, she has said in interviews that her Christian faith has helped her overcome personal turmoil. But in 2011 she labeled the Vatican a “nest of vipers” over alleged child sex abuse. Last year, she sent a sexually explicit message to Russell Brand after he offered her mental health support. Brand sent a supportive message to the singer, saying that following a public breakdown she needed “connection, meaning, purpose, love and a bit of time, really.” She replied: “Could also do with a jolly good rogering, frankly. The last man who touched my body took out my reproductive system two years ago. “So if you really wanna be part of my healing journey, c’mon, horse it into me, boss.”"	nonTerrorism	Religion
 Mass rally to promote moderate Islam in Indonesia canceled	"Organizers of an Indonesian movement to promote a moderate brand of Islam have canceled a mass rally after its youth supporters burned the flag of an outlawed hard-line Muslim group, sparking allegations of blasphemy. The rally in Yogyakarta, predicted to draw 100,000 people, was canceled to prevent violence, said Yahya Cholil Staquf, general secretary of Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia's largest Muslim organization. Video of members of Nahdlatul Ulama's youth arm burning the flag of the outlawed group, Hizbut Tahrir, has stirred controversy in Indonesia because the flag is also emblazoned with the Islamic declaration of faith. At least 1,000 people protested the flag burning in Jakarta and Bandung on Friday, demanding prosecution of those responsible. Demonstrators in white Islamic robes snarled traffic outside the security ministry in Jakarta, waving flags with Arabic text professing belief in one God and chanting ""God is great"" and ""No God except Allah."" Staquf said Hizbut Tahrir ""operatives"" disrupted the youth wing's celebrations and exploited religious symbols, which led to the flag burning incident. He said the campaign of ""provocation and sabotage"" was widely believed to be directed by political forces hoping to influence the outcome of Indonesia's presidential election in April. Some 70,000 members of Ansor, Nahdlatul Ulama's youth arm, had been on their way to Yogyakarta for the rally to coincide with the launch of an inter-faith movement that aims to counter extremism globally. ""Further incidents of provocation were planned. Our members would find it difficult to control their anger in the face of such flagrant exploitation of our religious symbols,"" said Staquf. The image of Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, as being religiously moderate was undermined last year when the minority Christian governor of the capital, Jakarta, was imprisoned for blasphemy following street protests against him that drew hundreds of thousands. Hizbut Tahrir, which seeks a global caliphate, was banned by the Indonesian government last year."	nonTerrorism	Religion
"AP PHOTOS: In Morocco, tribal tattoos fade with age, Islam"	"In Morocco's Middle Atlas mountains, an ancient tradition is fading. The distinctive tribal tattoos that indigenous Amazigh women acquired in a coming of age ritual are slowly disappearing as their bearers age and die. Strictly observant Muslims and women who want to be modern have shunned the practice, which dates to pre-Islamic times. Today, the tattoos largely are found on older Berber women who farm in rural areas. Amazigh tattoos, whether simple or elaborate, usually consist of lines, dots, triangles and circles. Girls get their first ones during puberty; those who tolerate the pain are considered mature enough for the adult responsibilities of life in the rugged mountains. The ink work is done for more than adornment. The imagery tells stories of tribes, ties to the land and families. The designs go on chins, cheeks and between the eyes, and extend to forearms as women mark milestones like marriage and motherhood. ""When I was 10 years old, we did (the tattoo) with a little needle. We jabbed my chin and we made a drawing,"" Hadda Oaabbjdi, 72, said of her first tattoo. ""This drawing is a sign that represents my village and my region, Tingaref."" Many Amazigh women consider their ""ouchem"" feminine touches that set them apart from men and enhance their beauty, what 100-year-old Fadma Olla described as ""a kind of makeup"" she applied in her youth. ""Back then, I decorated my arms because I was wearing a Melhaf (traditional fabric), and we would pull it up so our arms could be seen. We did this when we were young; it was a sign of beauty."" At the height of their popularity, the tattoos were seen as having the power to drive away bad spirits and bring good fortune. Some accounts said that during French colonial rule, some indigenous women believed their marked faces would make them undesirable to foreign men. However, the claim is widely disputed since the tattoos predate the colonization of Morocco. Today, as tattoos etched decades ago grow fainter on the faces of women grown old, so, too, have they waned in social acceptance. In Morocco, wearing ""ouchem"" now is generally seen as outdated or worse. Growing awareness that some branches of Islam prohibit tattoos has caused some women to try to have theirs removed. Religion is considered the key reason many parents decided against tattooing their daughters. But many women defend the practice. Hadda Saghir, 60, offered the much-repeated though unproven claim that the Prophet Muhammad's daughter, Fatima Al-Zahra, was inked as evidence her own tattoos couldn't be sinful. ""They told me God would burn me in hell for these,"" Saghir said, pointing to the Amazigh language symbols on her cheeks. ""I belong to Him and I don't believe that."" ""The tattoos will disappear one day,"" she added. ""But until then, we remain loyal to our traditions."""	nonTerrorism	Religion
 UN investigator: Genocide still taking place in Myanmar	"Genocide is still taking place against Rohingya Muslims remaining in Myanmar and the government is increasingly demonstrating it has no interest in establishing a fully functioning democracy, U.N. investigators said Wednesday. Marzuki Darusman, chair of the U.N. fact-finding mission on Myanmar, said thousands of Rohingya are still fleeing to Bangladesh, and the estimated 250,000 to 400,000 who have remained following last year's brutal military campaign in the Buddhist-majority country ""continue to suffer the most severe"" restrictions and repression. ""It is an ongoing genocide that is taking place at the moment,"" he told a news conference Wednesday. Yanghee Lee, the U.N. special investigator on human rights in Myanmar, said she and many others in the international community hoped the situation under Aung San Suu Kyi ""would be vastly different from the past — but it is really not that much different from the past."" She added later that she thinks Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former political prisoner who now leads Myanmar's civilian government, ""is in total denial"" about accusations that the military in Buddhist-majority Myanmar raped, murdered and tortured Rohingya and burned their villages, sending about 700,000 fleeing to Bangladesh since August last year. ""The government is increasingly demonstrating that it has no interest and capacity in establishing a fully functioning democracy where all its people equally enjoy all their rights and freedoms,"" Lee said. ""It is not upholding justice and rule of law"" which Suu Kyi ""repeatedly says is the standard to which all in Myanmar are held."" If this were the case, she said, fair laws would be applied impartially to all people, impunity would not rein, ""and the law would not be wielded as a weapon of oppression."" Suu Kyi's government has rejected independent international investigations into the alleged abuses and has commissioned its own probe. The government has also rejected the report by the mission led by Darusman which said some top military leaders should be prosecuted for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide against the Rohingya during the crackdown. ""The Myanmar government's hardened positions are by far the greatest obstacle,"" Darusman told reporters. ""Its continued denials, its attempts to shield itself under the cover of national sovereignty and its dismissal of 444 pages of details about the facts and circumstances of recent human rights violations that point to the most serious crimes under international law"" strengthens the need for international action because ""accountability cannot be expected from the national processes,"" he said. Marzuki was scheduled to brief the U.N. Security Council Wednesday, a meeting which six of the council's 15 members objected to, including China, which is Myanmar's neighbor and ally, Russia, Bolivia, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia and Kazakhstan. Marzuki said he will urge the council to take action to hold those responsible for atrocities against the Rohingya accountable, either by referring Myanmar to the International Criminal Court or setting up an international tribunal. But any action appears highly unlikely because of almost certain opposition from China, a veto-wielding council member. As for the Rohingya refugees returning to Myanmar, Lee said, ""there's been a lot of progress in terms of economic development and infrastructure, but in the area of 'democratic space' and people's right to claim back their land ... there is no progress."" ""The repatriation is not possible now,"" she stressed. ""I will not encourage any repatriation. Conducive conditions means they should not go back to the existing laws, policies and practices ... the oppressive laws, the discrimination. The minimum they need is freedom of movement, access to basic health services."" ""Right now, it's like an apartheid situation where Rohingyas still living in Myanmar ... have no freedom of movement,"" Lee said. ""The camps, the shelters, the model villages that are being built, it's more of a cementing of total segregation or separation from the Rakhine ethnic community."""	nonTerrorism	Religion

"Polygamy persists across Africa, to activists' dismay"	"The suspicion of a third wife was planted in Irene Atenyo's mind when her husband could not account for his most recent pay. When she confronted him, he beat her ""like an animal"" and briefly kicked her out, she said. She winced as she recalled his confession days later of being involved with a student. ""My fear is I am home settled, being faithful to an unfaithful man, but who knows what kind of disease he will carry for me home?"" the 27-year-old fruit vendor in Uganda's capital told The Associated Press. She is not alone. Millions of women across sub-Saharan Africa are still living in the complex relationships of polygamy, a centuries-old practice once the norm among African men seeking large families to cultivate the land. According to the United Nations, which opposes the practice, polygamy was legal or generally accepted in 33 countries, 25 of them in Africa, as of 2009. Campaigners urge governments to enact laws that protect women's dignity and reject any religious argument for polygamy, saying the practice shackles women and often worsens the risk of disease and poverty. There hasn't been much success. A panel of judges last month rejected a petition to have polygamy declared unconstitutional in Uganda, where it is permissible for Muslims and those in customary marriages sealed with the traditional payment of bride price but not for those seeking Christian or civil unions. Neighboring Kenya legalized polygamous unions for men in 2014 with overwhelming support from male lawmakers, as the majority leader argued that the biblical David and Solomon ""never consulted anybody"" when choosing multiple partners. In South Africa, where former president Jacob Zuma has four wives, polygamy has long been legal under customary arrangements. And Tanzanian President John Magufuli actively encourages polygamy, citing the 10 million more women than men in his country. In February he told men to marry ""two or more wives"" to reduce the number of single women. Polygamy is still rampant in many countries in the Horn of Africa and East Africa even as the practice loses popularity in Muslim-majority communities of North Africa, said Hala al-Karib, a Sudanese activist who runs the Strategic Initiative for Women in the Horn of Africa, a network of civil society groups. ""Polygamy is contributing to massive chaos,"" she said. ""It really victimizes children and their mothers."" And it can fuel conflict: In war-ravaged South Sudan, where polygamy is commonly practiced, the raiding of cattle to pay bride prices can inflame ethnic tensions. Women's rights activists say the entrenched patriarchy that encourages practices such as polygamy is a major reason why the world's poorest continent now accounts for most of the growth in the global population. ""Demand for children is higher on average in sub-Saharan Africa than in any other region,"" with the fertility rate around 5.1 births per woman, a United Nations report released this month says. Polygamy's issues are often dramatized by Nollywood, Nigeria's booming film industry that is popular across the continent, with lurid tales of witchcraft and murder. In real life, Ugandan newspapers often report tales of co-wives attacking each other, sometimes with acid or other chemicals that leave the victim's face horribly burned. Some co-wives reportedly compete to have as many children as possible in hopes of winning the favor of the man's family, especially if there is substantial land to be inherited. The Ugandan organization whose petition against polygamy was rejected, MIFUMI, says it plans to file a new challenge on the grounds that the practice undermines women's dignity. Polygamy is cited in half of the 2,000 to 3,000 cases of domestic violence handled by the organization each year, said Patrick Ndira, its deputy executive director. ""We think that polygamy is the factor that underscores discrimination between men and women,"" Ndira said. ""The women don't have any recourse if a man decides to become polygamous."" Yusuf Nsibambi with the Uganda Muslim Lawyers Association said the group would oppose any legal challenge to polygamy by asserting religious rights as Muslims. ""Here the Muslims who practice polygamy, they do so largely because they are African,"" Rwakafuuzi said. ""It is just Africanist culture. They are hiding behind Islam."" Atenyo, who recently discovered the potential third wife, said she felt compelled to confront her rival but their phone conversation ended abruptly when the other woman said she needed the money too. ""I was in shock. Sometimes I wonder if I am not beautiful. But how can I be beautiful when I spend hours under the scorching sun vending on the streets?"" Atenyo said. ""I have suffered in this polygamous marriage and I would not wish for any other woman to go through it."" She worries that her husband, a Christian man, will one day abandon the family altogether as he seeks younger brides. His second wife recently left temporarily while citing neglect, Atenyo said. ""Your co-wife can be brought in anytime, and so if you are not sharp you can leave with a paper bag,"" she said. ""Nowadays I vend in order to save some money for security, in case he comes with another wife."""	nonTerrorism	Religion
 Issue of married Catholic priests gains traction under pope	" As the Vatican copes with the growing clergy sex abuse scandal and declining number of priests worldwide, it is laying the groundwork to open formal debate on an issue that has long been taboo: opening up the priesthood to married men in parts of the world where clergy are scarce. Pope Francis has convened a meeting of South American bishops next year focusing on the plight of the church in the Amazon, a vast territory served by far too few priests. During that synod, the question of ordaining married men of proven virtue — so-called ""viri probati"" — is expected to figure on the agenda. This week, a two-hour documentary on Italian television is likely to contribute to the conversation. ""The Choice: Priests and Love"" profiles more than a dozen men in four European countries who are either living clandestinely with women, have created their own unsanctioned church communities where married priests preside at Mass, or left the Catholic priesthood altogether to marry. The documentary, to be aired Wednesday on Discovery Italia and previewed to The Associated Press, makes the case that many of these men would gladly return to the priesthood and offer their pastoral services. Their plight has found a sympathetic ear in Francis, who has long expressed a willingness to consider ""viri probati"" to address pastoral needs in the Amazon. He has also expressed sympathy for priests who have made the anguished choice to leave. Vocatio, an Italian association of these ""married priests,"" wrote Francis earlier this month pledging their solidarity as he copes with the global fallout of the sex abuse scandal, and once again offering their services in ministry. ""We would like you to take into consideration — without prejudice or pretense — the opportunity of allowing us an active presence in diocesan activity, given our experience and competence in the sacraments we have lived: ministry and matrimony,"" the group wrote. The head of Vocatio, former priest Rosario Mocciaro who married civilly in 1977, estimates there are about 5,000 men in Italy alone who have left the priesthood, a third of whom would seek a return to married ministry if allowed. He said he was hopeful for progress under Francis and some sympathetic Italian bishops, saying they brought ""a new air and atmosphere"" to a long-standing problem. ""The possibility of having 'viri probati' would be a great opening, a great step forward,"" he told AP, adding it would begin to sensitize the church and public opinion to the prospect of both a married and a celibate priesthood. The celibate priesthood has been a tradition of the Latin rite Catholic Church since the 11th century; no doctrine requires it, and many eastern rite Catholic Churches allow married men to be ordained. In addition, the Catholic Church allows married Anglican clergy who convert to remain in priestly ministry. Francis has long said he appreciates the discipline of celibacy, but that it can change given it is discipline, not doctrine. History's first Latin American pope has been particularly attentive to the argument in favor of the ""viri probati"" in the Amazon, where the mostly indigenous faithful can go months without seeing a priest, and where Protestant and evangelical churches are wooing away Catholic souls. While the situation is particularly grave there, overall the number of priests worldwide has dropped for another consecutive year — down 687 to 414,969 — while the global Catholic population has grown by 14.25 million, according to recent figures from the Vatican's Fides missionary service. Opening the priesthood to married men, even in limited and localized places, would open the question of providing financially for the priests' families — an expense long cited as a key reason for the imposition of celibacy in the 11th century: The church didn't want its assets to pass down to priests' heirs. The issue of providing for the children of priests, however, is already on the agenda at the Vatican and in bishops conferences and religious orders around the world, given the cases of priests who violate their celibacy vows and have children secretly. An Irish psychotherapist and son of a priest, Vincent Doyle, has founded an online resource, Coping International, to offer assistance for priests' children, who often endure depression, anxiety and other mental health issues blamed on the silence imposed on them by the church. Doyle has successfully petitioned the pope's Pontifical Council for the Protection of Minors — his hand-picked sex abuse advisory committee — to consider the issue of priests' children to be part of its mandate, given some of these children are born to minors. ""Our expectation is that from this process will emerge initiatives that can contribute to the healing of those impacted by this issue,"" wrote commission member Neville Owen, who heads the commission's committee on guidelines"	nonTerrorism	Religion
 Young Catholics urge Vatican to issue inclusive LGBT message	"Catholic bishops are entering their final week of debate over hot-button issues facing young Catholics, including how the church should welcome gays and respond to the clerical sex abuse scandal that has discredited many in the church hierarchy. The monthlong synod of bishops ends next Saturday with the adoption by the 260-plus cardinals, bishops and priests of a final document and approval of a separate, shorter letter to the world's Catholic youth. Some of the youth delegates to the meeting have insisted that the final document express an inclusive message to make LGBT Catholics feel welcome in a church that has often shunned them. The Vatican took a step in that direction by making a reference to ""LGBT"" for the first time in its preparatory document heading into the meeting. But some bishops have balked at the notion, including Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput, who insisted in his speech that ""there is no such thing as an 'LGBTQ Catholic' or a 'transgender Catholic' or a 'heterosexual Catholic,' as if our sexual appetites defined who we are."" But other bishops have expressed a willingness to use the language, though it remains to be seen if the final document or the letter will. Each paragraph will be voted on one by one and must obtain a two-thirds majority. ""The youth are talking about it freely and in the language they use, and they are encouraging us 'Call us, address us this because this is who we are,'"" Papua New Guinea Cardinal John Ribat told a press conference Saturday. One of those young people, Yadira Vieyra, who works with migrant families in Chicago, said gays often feel attacked and shunned by the church. ""We know that's not true, any Catholic knows that's not true,"" she said. But she added bishops need to communicate that ""the church is here for them."" Catholic church teaching holds that gays should be loved and respected but that homosexual acts are ""intrinsically disordered."" The Oct. 3-28 synod has unfolded against the backdrop of the clergy sex abuse scandal exploding anew in the U.S., Germany, Poland and other nations. Some conservatives have charged that a gay subculture in the priesthood is to blame, even though studies have shown that gays are not more likely than heterosexuals to abuse. Many of the young delegates have insisted that the final document address the abuse scandal straight on, and Melbourne Archbishop Peter Comensoli hinted that it would. ""One of the key things that will be important going forward is not just that there might be a word of apology, of recognition and of aiming for better practices, but that there is action associated with that,"" he said. Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich said young people are also demanding accountability and transparency from the church's leadership, which has been excoriated for having covered-up the abuses of predator priests for decades. He repeated his call, first made in an interview last week with National Catholic Reporter, for bishops to cede their own authority and allow an external process involving lay experts to investigate them when an accusation against them has been made. ""Lay people want us to succeed. People want us to get this right,"" Cupich said. ""Yes, there's a lot of anger out there. But beneath that anger there's a sadness. There's a sadness that the church is better than this, and that we should get this right."""	nonTerrorism	Religion
"Pope accuser strikes back, blames gay priesthood for abuse"	"The Vatican ambassador who accused Pope Francis of rehabilitating a disgraced ex-American cardinal is doubling down on his claims, asserting that the ""scourge of homosexuality"" in the priesthood is responsible for sex abuse and that the Vatican is being hypocritical in refusing to acknowledge it. Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano issued a third installment Friday in the war of words over the cover-up of ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick. He was responding to a Vatican cardinal who had rebuked him and accused him of mounting a ""blasphemous"" political hit job against Francis with his claims. Vigano has accused Francis of effectively rehabilitating McCarrick, 88, from restrictions imposed during Pope Benedict XVI's papacy because of allegations he pressured seminarians to sleep with him. He has called for Francis to resign over the McCarrick scandal, which has sparked a crisis of confidence in the U.S. and Vatican hierarchy. Francis has responded to the McCarrick allegations by removing him as a cardinal, over an allegation he molested a minor, and by ordering a Vatican investigation into its archives to determine how McCarrick rose through the ranks despite allegations he also molested adults. Pre-empting the outcome, Cardinal Marc Oullet, who heads the Vatican's bishops' office, penned a letter Oct. 4 saying he had gone through his archives and found no evidence of any formal canonical sanctions signed by any pope. In his new missive, Vigano accurately noted that Ouellet actually confirmed the core of his allegations: that McCarrick was placed under some form of restriction — not necessarily formal sanctions — because of alleged sexual misconduct. Refuting Ouellet's claim that the Vatican only had heard rumors about McCarrick, Vigano listed all the letters that had reached the Vatican starting in 2000, when a priest from a New Jersey seminary first wrote relaying concerns from seminarians invited to McCarrick's beach house and into his bed. Vigano said he was shocked that Ouellet omitted any reference in his letter to McCarrick's victims, or to what he said was the ""principal cause of so many sexual abuses: homosexuality."" ""It's hypocrisy to refuse to admit that this scourge is due to a grave crisis in the spiritual life of clergy, and to not take measures to remedy it,"" he wrote. While the McCarrick scandal has exposed how seminarians can be vulnerable to sexual abuses by their gay superiors, studies have shown that homosexuals in general are no more likely to abuse than heterosexuals. Vigano, who was Vatican ambassador to the U.S. from 2011-2016, was allied with the conservative culture warriors among U.S. bishops, particularly in articulating the Catholic Church's opposition to gay marriage. Vigano's latest letter appeared Friday on the blog of Marco Tosatti, the conservative Italian journalist who helped Vigano write and edit his original 11-page accusation, and then arranged for its publication in right-wing media Aug. 26."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Former Chinese internment camp detainee denied US visa	" An outspoken former detainee in China's internment camps for Muslims said Thursday his application for a visa to visit the United States was rejected despite an invitation to speak at Congress about his ordeal. Kazakh national Omir Bekali was asked to travel to Washington in September by the chairs of the Congressional-Executive Committee on China. He said his application was rejected by the U.S. Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 after he was questioned about his employment status. Bekali was one of the first people to speak out publicly about his experience in a camp in China's Xinjiang region, where an estimated 1 million Muslims, mostly from the Uighur and Kazakh ethnicities, are being detained. ""They kept going back and forth. Why did they invite me and then reject my visa?"" Bekali said by phone from Turkey. ""I've received so many threats after speaking out, I feel like they should be able to do at least this simple request."" Commission spokesman Scott Flipse confirmed the invitation and said the co-chairs had written to Bekali offering to assist him in seeking a visa. Flipse referred further questions about Bekali's visa status to the State Department, which handles consular issues. The department declined to comment on Bekali's case, saying U.S. immigration law prohibits it from discussing individual visa applications. ""We continue to urge China to reverse its counterproductive policies that conflate terrorism with peaceful religious and political expression, and to release all those arbitrarily detained in these camps,"" the department said in a statement. Bekali wants to take his family to Europe or the United States, where he feels they will be safe from China's reach. Last month, his wife and child were held up at a Turkish airport for more than three days and were nearly put on a flight back to Kazakhstan. He had fled Almaty earlier after he was interrogated by Kazakh police, who he said showed up at his home shortly after he spoke out about the camps. Kazakh authorities did not respond to a request for comment. Bekali said that even though he's been reunited with his family in Turkey, he won't feel safe until his family moves to a country that can stand up to Beijing's influence, underscoring the deep anxiety that grips the diaspora of Muslims who once lived in Xinjiang under an intense security crackdown. ""I'm scared China will find some way to hurt me or threaten me,"" Bekali said. ""Every day I have nightmares, I can't sleep at night."" China has come under increasing pressure from Western governments about its mass internment of Muslims. The commission, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers, has proposed legislation that would urge Trump to condemn ""gross violations"" of human rights in Xinjiang. Bekali is named in the proposed legislation as among those who have testified to the indoctrination, humiliation and indefinite detention of internees. ""In China, the government is engaged in the persecution of religious and ethnic minorities that is straight out of George Orwell,"" outgoing U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said in a speech on Monday. ""It is the largest internment of civilians in the world today."" China on Tuesday characterized its mass internment of Muslims as a push to bring into the ""modern, civilized"" world a destitute people who are easily led astray. China's resistance to Western pressure over the camps highlights its growing confidence under President Xi Jinping, who has offered Beijing's authoritarian system as a model for other countries. The Muslim world has remained largely silent, a likely reflection of China's growing economic and political clout. In Kazakhstan, Chinese-Kazakh activists say they have been repeatedly warned by government officials not to hold news conferences featuring relatives of people detained in Xinjiang. Beijing has invested heavily in the central Asian nation and made it a key part of its ""Belt and Road"" trade and infrastructure initiative. Even Turkey, once a critic of China's Xinjiang policies, has fallen silent. Many of the thousands of Uighur exiles in Turkey worry about warming ties between Beijing and Ankara, with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu telling reporters in August that Turkey would not allow any ""anti-China activity."" ""China's economic power is so strong, and only getting stronger. Everyone's scared of the pressure China can exert on them,"" Bekali said. ""I've lost faith in other countries."" Associated Press writer Varya Kudryavtseva in Moscow contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Religion
China region gives legal basis for Muslim internment camps	" China's far-northwestern region of Xinjiang has revised legislation to provide a legal basis for internment camps where up to 1 million Muslims are being held amid mounting international criticism. New clauses adopted by the regional government officially permit the use of ""education and training centers"" to reform ""people influenced by extremism."" Chinese authorities deny that the internment camps exist but say petty criminals are sent to vocational ""training centers."" Former detainees in the centers say they were forced to denounce Islam and profess loyalty to the Communist Party in what they describe as political indoctrination camps. ""It's a retrospective justification for the mass detainment of Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang,"" said James Leibold, a scholar of Chinese ethnic policies at Melbourne's La Trobe University. ""It's a new form of re-education that's unprecedented and doesn't really have a legal basis, and I see them scrambling to try to create a legal basis for this policy."" The revisions, published Tuesday, say government agencies at the county level and above ""may establish occupational skills education and training centers, education transformation organizations and management departments to transform people influenced by extremism through education."" A new clause directs the centers to teach the Mandarin language and provide occupational and legal education, as well as ""ideological education, psychological rehabilitation and behavior correction."" The original legislation announced in 2017 banned the wearing of veils, ""extreme speech and behavior"" and the refusal to listen to public radio and television broadcasts. Beijing has spent decades trying to suppress pro-independence sentiment in Xinjiang fueled in part by frustration about an influx of migrants from China's Han majority. Authorities say extremists there have ties to foreign terror groups but have given little evidence to support that. Members of Uighur, also spelled Uyghur, Kazakh and other Muslim minorities who live abroad say they have not been able to contact relatives in China, while authorities are placing children separated from their detained or exiled parents into dozens of state-run orphanages across Xinjiang. Leibold believes that the revisions are an attempt to deflect international criticism. China has come under increasing pressure from the U.S. and the European Union after a United Nations panel confronted Chinese diplomats in August over reports of arbitrary mass detentions and harsh security measures aimed at Muslims, and China is up for review by the U.N.'s Human Rights Council in November. ""Regardless of these revisions, I still believe the practice of coercively detaining Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang in ""education through transformation centers"" not only violates Chinese law but also international legal norms against the extrajudicial deprivation of liberty,"" Leibold said."	nonTerrorism	Religion
"The significance of Pope Francis' UAE visit is impossible to exaggerate (Nobel Committee, take note)"	"The crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed, knew exactly what he was doing when he invited Pope Francis to visit the Arabian Peninsula to inaugurate the UAE’s “Year of Tolerance.” The visit, which is underway now, represents a historic first in 1,400 years of Islamic history, and it is impossible to exaggerate its significance. Never before has a sitting pontiff been invited by a Muslim ruler to visit the Peninsula which also plays host to Islam’s holiest sites of Mecca and Medina. The visit is not taking place in the shadows, either. Pope Francis will deliver a public mass for more than 120,000 residents of the United Arab Emirates in the national stadium. That gathering, which will represent one of the largest public gatherings in the history of the Arab Sheikhdom, will be broadcast on live television throughout the entire Islamic world, as will the pope’s visit to the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque and his meetings with various religious leaders from around the world who are gathered here to commemorate his visit. POPE CALLS FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, RAILS AGAINST 'FAKE NEWS' DURING HISTORIC VISIT TO UAE Adorning the street lights of Abu Dhabi today are two flags: the flag of UAE and the flag of the Vatican. Meanwhile, in a profound statement to the broader Islamic world, the pope was warmly greeted upon his arrival by the Grand Sheikh of Egypt’s Al-Azhar University, the oldest and most serious institution of Islamic learning in the entire Arab world. Astonishingly, one of Saudi Arabia’s most important daily newspapers included on its front page, above-the-fold, an article entitled, “Saudi Arabia may feature in future Papal Visit.” That same Saudi newspaper also tweeted, “#PopeFrancis’s unprecedented three-day visit to the UAE will not only mark the first official papal trip ... but also carries hopes with it of a new era of religious tolerance in the Gulf.” Nearly every Arabic language paper in the entire region is featuring the visit on its front page. All of these efforts have an obvious intention – they are meant to signal a new era in the Arab world, for a new generation that is tired of the bastardizing of their religion by extremists. The prime minister and vice president of the UAE, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, put it more elegantly: “We have learned from hundreds of thousands of dead and millions of refugees in our region that sectarian, ideological, cultural and religious bigotry only fuel the fires of rage. We cannot and will not allow this in our country. We need to study, teach and practice tolerance and instill it in our children, both through education and our own example.” Dr. Zaki Nusseibeh, a longtime member of the government agreed, telling me recently, “It is not sufficient to talk about abstract concepts like human fraternity and peaceful coexistence, we have to do something about it.” Many such actions are being undertaken, but one that particularly struck me was an announcement made by the noted minister of culture, Her Excellency Noura Al Kaabi, that the UAE would be rebuilding two churches destroyed by Daesh (ISIS) in Mosul, Iraq. Those churches are adjacent to the very Grand Mosque where the leader of the so-called Islamic State announced his now-decimated “caliphate.” Rebuilding those churches represents a profound act of solidarity with Iraq’s beleaguered Christian community, and a demonstration of the triumph of peace over the terror that ravaged Iraq just a few years ago. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The UAE has long been a beacon of openness, freedom and tolerance in the Islamic world. Those values have emanated from its famous business and tourism cities of Dubai and Abu Dhabi. But this week’s events have taken those efforts to another plane, entirely. They are the fodder of history, examples of profound leadership in a turbulent time, and they deserve the commendation of the entire world. They also merit the notice of the Nobel Committee."	nonTerrorism	Religion
" Pope calls for religious freedom, rails against 'fake news' during historic visit to UAE"	" Pope Francis warned against ""fake news"" and called for full religious freedom at an interfaith meeting in the United Arab Emirates as part of the first-ever papal visit to the Arabian Peninsula, the birthplace of Islam, as part of a three-day trip in a region known for its restrictions on non-Muslims. On Monday, the pope addressed an interfaith gathering -- aimed at building bridges between Muslims and Christians -- in which the Holy Father called for all religious leaders to reject war and commit themselves to dialogue. TIM TEBOW GIVES 'PERFECTLY TIMED' RESPONSE TO SOMEONE YELLING 'JESUS' AFTER HIS SWING ""We will either build the future together or there will not be a future,"" Francis said. ""The time has come when religions should more actively exert themselves, with courage and audacity, and without pretense, to help the human family deepen the capacity for reconciliation, the vision of hope and the concrete paths of peace."" The head of the Sunni Islam's highest seat of learning echoed the pope's message, adding that all faiths denounce terrorism in all its forms and that acts of terrorism are carried out by criminals, not by true believers of God. Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, the head of Al-Azhar, said the media portrayed Islam as a ""bloodthirsty"" religion after 9/11, adding that Muslims paid a heavy price for the acts of a few. I ASKED GOD TO END THE SUFFERING IN MY LIFE - WHAT HAPPENED NEXT STUNNED ME The Muslim Council of Elders and the pope met and recognized efforts by Pope Francis and al-Tayeb to foster peace. Earlier in the day, the Holy Father arrived at the presidential palace in a small Kia hatchback, welcomed by Abu Dhabi's crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and Emirati vice president and prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, in a pomp-filled welcome ceremony that included horse-mounted guards, canons, and a flyover. The Emirates' support for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, which has caused the world's worst humanitarian crisis, and the UAE's problematic record on human rights and labor violations at home likely will get a pass — at least in public. Prior to his departure, the pope called for an end to Yemen's humanitarian crisis, saying the ""cries of these children and their parents rise up"" to God. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The UAE professes a moderate form of Islam and has a Ministry of Tolerance. The nation even declared 2019 ""The Year of Tolerance,"" but non-Muslims cannot profess their faith in the media or try to spread it, as conversion from Islam is illegal. Even so, the country stands out in a region where Christians are persecuted and their numbers are dwindling, and the pope hopes his visit encourages UAE to build more churches for the estimated one million Roman Catholic migrants in the country. The pope's visit is a ""dream come true"" for most of the Christian minority that comes from foreign countries working in the UAE as construction workers, housekeepers, and oil-industry employees, according to The National, a state-linked, newspaper in Abu Dhabi. His trip culminates on Tuesday with a huge papal Mass at the city's sports stadium expected to draw some 135,000 faithful in a never-before-seen display of public Christian worship here. 'WHEN GOD BECOMES REAL': BETHEL PASTOR OPENS UP AFTER BEING HOSPITALIZED FOR NERVOUS BREAKDOWN Rev. Andrew Thompson of St. Andrew's Anglican Church in Abu Dhabi said his congregation was excited for Pope Francis' Mass on Tuesday. Thompson said: ""My congregation is so happy we are witnessing what will be the biggest Christian act of worship in the history of the Arabian Gulf, and we are excited to be a part of that.""

Asia Bibi’s whereabouts shrouded in secrecy over fears for her safety	"Asia Bibi, 54, is technically a “free woman” – having had her death sentence for blasphemy thrown out by the Pakistani court – but she is far from safe enough to step foot in public, as religious extremists still call for her hanging. A Pakistan official told Fox News Friday that – despite rampant rumors and reports indicating otherwise – Bibi remains under tight protection by authorities in Pakistan – as security steps to enable her to depart secretly are still being put in place. A Canadian government source also told Fox News that reports Friday of Bibi having already arrived in Canada were false. Yet her exact whereabouts, believed to be in Pakistan, remains murky and shrouded in mixed messages. “The reality is that very, very few people know where she is and next to no one will be told when she leaves. Her family might not even be told beforehand,” another source close to Bibi’s relatives said. “It has been done under extremism secrecy for her safety. It’s assumed that she will leave as soon as possible, but it isn’t that easy.” The general consensus is that Bibi cannot leave Pakistan on a commercial flight, and any exit needs to be discreet and carefully planned. The Pakistan government, according to officials, is said to be “fully behind” helping her safely depart and one well-placed official said that they are waiting for the situation to “calm down” before making any moves. Bibi, who was falsely accused of blasphemy almost 10 years ago and sentenced to death, was acquitted by Pakistan’s Supreme Court in October. The ruling ignited an eruption of protests by religious extremists, who took the streets burning her posters and calling for the judges to be killed. The Tehreek-e-Labbaik Party, led by radical cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi, pushed to have the ruling overturned. Nonetheless, Pakistan’s Supreme Court upheld the acquittal this week and stated that Bibi was free to leave the country. Bibi has since been living in an undisclosed location under the protection of Pakistani authorities. Last year, Bibi’s immediate family was granted asylum in Canada and it is expected that she too will join them according to multiple sources closely connected to the case. “The case of Asia Bibi is a priority for our government, and we are focused on ensuring the safety of her and her family. We are working with like-minded friends and allies on this issue. Canada is prepared to do everything we can to ensure the safety of Asia Bibi,” a representative for Canada’s Global Affairs told Fox News on Friday. “We urge the Government of Pakistan to take all necessary steps to keep her safe. Freedom of religion is a fundamental human right, and must be fully respected.” A German newspaper reported Friday, citing Bibi’s attorney Saif ul Malook, that she had quietly already left for Canada, But he walked back those statements in an interview with Fox News on Friday, stressing that her safety remains in jeopardy. Malook too expressed concern for his safety, claiming that he is currently in Pakistan, having left the Netherlands to defend Bibi in 2014 – despite being told by authorities that, based on his visa status, once he left the country he would not be able to return. TLP has since called for another round of protests over Bibi’s acquittal – chorusing for her to be hanged. Bibi’s two daughters, as well as six other close relatives, are already in Canada, Malook said. He acknowledged that while the last time he saw her in-person was October, she is said to be very well-treated under protection and her health and wellbeing – having spent years languishing in jail with a plethora of physical and mental ailments – is of paramount importance to those guarding her. Bibi, a farmworker, was arrested in 2009 after her Muslim neighbors refused to drink from the same cup she had touched and then complained to authorities that she had insulted the Prophet Muhammad. Bibi subsequently spent eight years on death row. PAKISTAN OPEN TO AFRIDI TALKS WITH US, FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS There are said to be over 20 Christians in Pakistan specifically charged with blasphemy, and Malook intends to take on more defendants. “I’m proud to have represented her, she was a helpless and poor woman who had lost all hope,” he added. “And there are other poor women, just like her, who need my help.” The US State Department declined to comment on Bibi’s location or asylum status. However, several officials in Pakistan have said that Bibi’s landmark case has put an uncomfortable spotlight on the extremist elements. “The protests against Bibi have been such a shame for our society. We seriously need de-radicalization programs in our country,” one insider noted. Others also see a silver lining in that others on death-row for alleged blasphemy may soon receive a fair day in court, and that those making such false accusations may too finally be reprimanded in the court of law. Wilson Chowdhry, Chairman of the activist organization British Pakistani Christian Association – who has long championed Bibi’s case – pointed that in the case of Bibi, it was the first time a chief justice had drawn attention to and publicly condemned those who make such false accusations. “Historically, there has been resistance to hold false accusers to account. This is usually because of bribery or fear of repercussions. But the Supreme court this time has come out and said that the women who invented the blasphemy story against Asia should receive life imprisonment,” he said. “We are hopeful they are brought to justice because this serves as a deterrent to other would-be false accusers.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Rimmel Mohydin, Amnesty International’s South Asia Regional Campaigner, stressed that while it is “highly unlikely that the complainants in Asia Bibi’s case will be prosecuted,” it at least might indicate that “strict action will be taken in the future.” Human rights groups around the world praised the decision of Pakistan’s Supreme Court, highlighting that “truth and justice had prevailed.”"	nonTerrorism	Religion
 Cuba opens first church since start of communist rule with aid from Florida congregation	" Cuba is opening its doors to the first Catholic church on the island since the 1959 Communist Revolution ushered in an era of atheism. The Parish of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, one of three churches approved by Cuba following improved relations between the Vatican and the Communist government, was inaugurated Saturday in the far-western town of Sandino. PHILIPPINES PRESIDENT ORDERS MILITARY TO CRUSH ISLAMIC MILITANTS WHO SET OFF BOMBS IN CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL The new church opened in large part to the financial aid from members of St. Lawrence Church in Tampa, Florida after Father Ramon Hernandez, a Cuban-born priest at St. Lawrence, reached out in 2010 to Father Cirilo Castro, then a priest in Sandino, where people worshipped in their homes. ""Donations came from as far as San Francisco, New York, Wisconsin,"" Luisa Long, coordinator of Hispanic ministries for the Tampa church told the Tampa Bay Times. ""This was handled through St. Lawrence but made possible by many."" For the Cuban town of 40,000, the church gives them hope, amid international tensions. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""[Everyone] is excited about the new church,"" Hernandez said. ""Not just the Catholics but the whole town."" The Communist-ruled state cracked down on the Catholic church in the first decades after the revolution, expelling priests and taking over churches. It wasn't until the 1990s that Fidel Castro started easing restrictions on religion, and both Popes John Paul II and Francis have visited since then. The opening of the new church in Sandino was particularly significant because the town is home to families relocated from Cuba's Escambray region, where residents fought the Communist government in the first years after the revolution. ""This is a historic event for the church,"" Juan Hidalberto Hernandez, a Sandino church member, said. ""Many families and their descendants left their saints behind and didn't have a church to pray in."" The Tampa congregation donated about $95,000 for the new building, which holds some 200 worshippers and was built on land granted by the state. A new church in Havana is also being used for worship but remains structurally incomplete. A third sanctuary in Santiago has yet to begin significant construction.

"Aasia Bibi, Christian woman on Pakistan death row for blasphemy, acquitted in landmark ruling"	" A Christian woman in Pakistan on death row for nearly a decade after she allegedly contaminated a water jug -- an offense viewed as blasphemy in the Muslim country -- was acquitted by the country’s top court on Wednesday. Aasia Bibi was ordered released eight years after she was sentenced to death in 2010 on blasphemy charges – a landmark ruling that sparked widespread protests around Pakistan by hard-line Islamists and even led to the murder of a local governor. Bibi was not in court to hear the ruling, and AFP news agency quoted her as saying by phone: “I can’t believe what I am hearing, will I go out now? Will they let me out, really?” The charges against the 47-year-old mother of three dates back to a hot day in 2009 when she went to get some water for her and her fellow farmworkers. Later, two women refused to drink from the container she had touched because she was not Muslim. A few days later, a mob accused her of blasphemy after the women went to a local cleric in Sheikhupura – a city in Punjab – to report her. She was tried, convicted and sentenced to death. Bibi is being held at an undisclosed location for security reasons and is expected to leave the country. In Pakistan, the mere rumor of blasphemy against Muhammad can ignite mob violence and lynchings. Combatting alleged blasphemy has become a central rally cry for hard-line Islamists. Salman Taseer, the governor of Punjab province, was shot and killed by one of his guards in 2011 for defending Bibi and criticizing the misuse of the blasphemy law. The assassin, Mumtaz Qadri, has been celebrated as a martyr by hard-liners since he was hanged for the killing, with millions visiting a shrine set up for him near Islamabad. Bibi appealed her conviction to the Lahore High Court, which upheld the decision in October 2014, sending the case to Pakistan’s Supreme Court. Chief Justice Main Saqib Nisar announced the verdict to a packed courtroom Wednesday, saying Bibi’s “conviction is set aside and she is to be relieved forthwith if not required in other charges.” The three-judge panel upheld the blasphemy law itself, saying it was consistent with verses from Islam’s holy book, the Quran. But they said prosecutors had failed to prove that Bibi violated the law. In addition to citing the Quran, the judges also referenced William Shakespeare’s King Lear, saying Bibi was “more sinned against than sinning.” The ruling sent shockwaves across the country with hundreds of Islamists blocking a key road link the city of Rawalpindi with the capital, Islamabad. Islamists gathered in the country’s largest city, Karachi, in the northwestern city of Peshawar and elsewhere. Police urged demonstrators to disperse peacefully. Ahead of the verdict, Khadim Hussain Rizvi, a hard-line cleric who has brought tens of thousands of people into the streets for past rallies, called on his supporters to gather in all major cities to express their love for the prophet and to protest if Bibi is released. The decision is a victory for human rights activists, who said the country’s blasphemy law has been used to settle personal scores or to attack minority communities. The law carries a mandatory death penalty. According to Sky News, more than 1,300 have been charged in the last 30 years and many of them were murdered before their trial was even complete. “I am very happy. My children are very happy. We are grateful to God,” said Ashig Masih, who met with Pope Francis earlier this year. “We are grateful to the judges for giving us justice. We knew that she is innocent.” The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Pope walks through 'invisible wall' to bring World Youth Day to Panama inmates	"Pope Francis took time during his Panama trip for World Youth Day to visit a detention center Friday morning, the first time the Holy Father heard confessions in a prison in what turned out to be an extremely emotional service. Francis crossed what he called the ""invisible wall"" society puts up to marginalize criminals and sinners. The pontiff brought World Youth Day to Las Garzas de Pacora detention center, giving the inmates the same white T-shirts worn by youth at the Catholic Church's big youth festival and he heard the inmates' confessions inside confessionals the detainees constructed themselves. POPE FRANCIS URGEST CATHOLIC YOUTH TO BUILD BRIDGES, NOT 'WALLS THAT SOW FEAR AND LOOK TO DIVIDE' “There are no words to describe the freedom I feel in this moment,"" Luis Oscar Martinez, one of the inmates, told Francis at the beginning of the service. The 21-year-old, who has been locked up since 2016, said he lacked guidance from a father growing up and ""caused very deep pain to a loved one and to myself."" Martinez shared he hopes to please his mom and become an international chef, which drew a smile from the pope. ""I liked that confession of yours,"" Francis responded. ""We have a father who loves us."" Around 150 youth are locked up in the center for serious crimes, including murder. AMID WALL DEBATE, POPE SAYS FEAR OF MIGRATION MAKES US CRAZY Francis told them during his homily that society should spend time creating opportunities for them to change instead of labeling them good or bad, righteous or a sinner. “This attitude spoils everything because it erects an invisible wall that makes people think that, if we marginalize, separate and isolate others, all our problems will magically be solved,” Francis said, once again making reference to the walls that seek to divide people rather than unite them. Francis has made a tradition of visiting prisoners during his foreign visits and has long made prison ministry part of his vocation to minister to the most marginal in society. Just last year, Francis changed church teaching on the death penalty, saying it was inadmissible in all cases. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The change was in keeping with his belief that prisoners can always change and deserve chances for rehabilitation so they can re-enter society after serving their terms. Francis opened his first full day in Panama a day earlier with a message of hope formally welcoming tens of thousands of pilgrims to World Youth Day at a twilight pep rally at the capital's seaside park. He urged them to be builders of bridges of encounter, not ""builders of walls that sow fear and look to divide and box people in,"" a clear reference to the proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall.

American missionary in Brazil accused of exposing Amazon tribe to ‘risk of death’	"An American missionary in Brazil believed to have passed through the Amazon rainforest area occupied by a remote indigenous tribe is now being accused of exposing them to disease -- and even death. The claim against Steve Campbell from Brazil’s Indigenous Affairs Department (FUNAI) comes following an incident said to have taken place in December, one month after an American missionary was killed on the other side of the world while trying to encounter a tribe living on an island in the Indian Ocean. ??????MISSIONARY WROTE 'GOD, I DON'T WANT TO DIE' BEFORE BEING KILLED BY REMOTE TRIBE “It’s a case of rights violation and exposure to risk of death to isolated indigenous population,” a spokesperson for the agency told Reuters. “Even if direct contact has not occurred, the probability of transmission of diseases to the isolated is high.” Brazilian officials say Campbell camped in the area where the Hi-Merimã tribe live and entered one of their former camping sites. The tribe is known for their strong desire to be left alone from the outside world, according to Reuters. FUNAI says it will notify federal prosecutors and the police about the alleged encounter this week. AMERICAN MISSIONARY KILLED BY UNCONTACTED TRIBE HAD PLANNED MISSION FOR YEARS, REPORT SAYS FUNAI also claims that Campbell has been living amongst the tribe’s neighbors – the Jamamadi – without permission over the past several years. Brazilian media reports cited by Reuters say Campbell admitted to entering the Hi-Merimã tribe’s area by accident while teaching the Jamamadi how to use GPS devices. As of Thursday morning, Campbell was listed as a missionary on the website of Maine’s Greene Baptist Church, which states that he and his wife work in the Brazilian state of Amazonas to “help with medical, mechanical and countless other ministry opportunities.

National Shrine confirms report that Native American activist allegedly tried to disrupt Mass	"Officials at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday confirmed earlier reports that a Native American rights activist led several dozen people in an attempt to enter the shrine during a Saturday evening Mass. In a statement to Fox News on Wednesday, basilica officials said a Mass was being celebrated at 7 p.m. when Nathan Phillips and his group “attempted to enter the building while chanting and hitting drums.” MEDIA TREATMENT OF COVINGTON STUDENTS ‘WAY WORSE’ THAN KAVANAUGH COVERAGE, CRITIC SAYS “At this time, Mass was being celebrated in the upper church where the individuals attempted to enter,” the statement read. “In respect and reverence for the Mass, the individuals were not permitted to enter the Basilica due to the disruption it would have caused during the solemn Mass. The individuals were asked to leave the property after it was determined they did not intend to share in the celebration of Mass.” The group assembled across the street from the shrine, the Catholic News Agency reported. Video footage showed one demonstrator telling other protesters that they had been ordered off the property by police, according to CNA. Phillips, 64, was thrust into the national spotlight over the weekend when video of an encounter with a group of students from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky went viral.

The 67-year-old says he balances being a Buddhist and the adrenaline rush of gambling “with great difficulty” and he credits his religion for helping up his game. “When you practice meditation and develop the qualities of mindfulness and awareness, you become friends with yourself,” he told PokerNews.com in the past. “You become more accustomed to all of those thoughts and emotions that course through our mind and often take control of us, emotionally or psychologically. As you become familiar with what’s going on with you, perhaps those thoughts and emotions have less power over you, so you can see more clearly what’s going on on the table, and what’s going on with you, and, hopefully, do the right thing.” He says sometimes deciphering the right thing is difficult. NEW JERSEY MAN DEFIES 20 MILLION-TO-1 ODDS TO WIN $1 MILLION AT POKER GAME “The right thing — I would say — should involve kindness, which is always a challenge at the table,” he said. “How do you be kind and still try to win?” Wellenbach, 67, says he rationalizes making money off others by giving it to charity. “A significant amount of money is won from people who are too addicted, too drunk, too unstudied, or too masochistic to play well,” he said. “We all have those features within us, but some of us have managed to temper our addiction to some extent so that we can play better. There’s a tension about winning money under those circumstances. I guess I rationalize my addiction by giving away the winnings.” In the past, he’s donated winnings to Oxfam, Doctors Without Borders and several other Buddhist charities including ones for nuns. As for how his most recent winnings will be divvied up, Wellenbach told PokerNews.com: “I hope that somehow a wise decision happens and the money goes to good purposes and certain human beings or … animals or whatever… or beings with feelings that their lives are eased in some way.

Israeli museum to remove 'McJesus' art sculpture after violent protests	" The controversial ""McJesus"" art sculpture -- depicting a life-size Ronald McDonald hanging from a cross -- will be removed from an Israeli museum following violent protests in Haifa, Israel. The city's first female mayor promised the removal of the ""offensive"" artwork from the Haifa Museum of Art Thursday, drawing criticism from free speech advocates and civil liberties groups. ""The work will be removed and returned as soon as possible,"" Haifa Mayor Einat Kalisch-Rotem said, thanking the local churches for their efforts to help reach a solution and prevent further violence. Hundreds of Christians in the Holy Land called for the artwork -- intended to be a criticism of capitalism worship -- removed. Police said that rioters who oppose the art have thrown stones and a firebomb at the museum, leaving three officers wounded. Authorities dispersed the crowds with tear gas and stun grenades. Kalisch-Rotem said the decision to remove the statue was made ""in agreement"" with church officials. She met with the local Greek Orthodox and Greek Catholic Church clergy after they requested the court remove ""McJesus"" earlier this week. The controversial artwork by Finnish artist, Jani Leinonen, was on loan from the Zetterberg Gallery last year and was due to return by the end of January. Leinonen's piece had been displayed in other countries with no complaints. But ""McJesus"" even led to in-fighting between Israeli state officials.

 Controversial 'McJesus' art sculpture defended by Israel	"Israel's Department of Justice was forced to intervene Tuesday in the controversy around a sculpture of ""McJesus"" — Jesus modeled as Ronald McDonald — that angered Christians in the Holy Land. The Ministry of Culture threatened to defund the Haifa Museum of Art, where ""McJesus"" is displayed and where violent protests broke out last week. ""This work does not belong in a cultural institution supported by state funds,"" Culture Minister Miri Regev wrote in a letter to the museum, adding that the sculpture, which is part of the ""Sacred Goods"" show that opened in August, makes a “mockery of the crucifix, the most important religious symbol for Christians around the world,” and could not be protected under freedom of speech. But the Department of Justice disagreed. “It is forbidden to block funding to cultural institutions because of the content they exhibit,” Deputy Attorney General Dina Zilber wrote in a letter to Regev Tuesday, reminding the minister that the government could not interfere with the contents presented at cultural institutions because it provides financial support. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel contacted the Department of Justice on behalf of the museum. “The Minister of Culture seems to have made a quantum leap,” wrote ACRI’s legal advisor, Dan Yakir. He said that while in the past the minister had instructed mayors or other elected officials to prevent cultural events when she did not like their content, it was beyond acceptable bounds to reach out directly to the museum. He said the move violated freedom of speech and expression. The sculpture's Finnish artist, Jani Leinonen, wants his artwork removed -- but for a different reason. He supports the pro-Palestinian group, Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions, or BDS, which discourages doing business with the Jewish state.

 US envoy needed to fight global anti-Semitism	" By any measure, anti-Semitism is on the rise globally. Physical assaults, verbal harassment and online vulgarity and threats have reached alarming levels. Despite this, the United States is still lacking an appointee for a key position to identify, expose and combat this scourge: the State Department special envoy to monitor and combat anti-Semitism. In March 2017 we noted in a Fox News op-ed that the White House had not acted to fill this position. It’s now 2019 and there is still no one in the job, while over this timeframe the situation has become markedly worse for Jews across the world. DANIEL MARIASCHIN AND MARK B. LEVIN: MR. TRUMP, NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO GET RID OF OUR ANTI-SEMITISM ENVOY A survey of more than 16,000 Jews in European Union member nations by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights uncovered some truly frightening statistics. Released in December, the survey found nearly 90 percent of respondents say anti-Semitism has increased in the past five years. Safety concerns are limiting respondents’ ability and desire to take part in Jewish events, with more than a third saying they avoid taking part in Jewish activities or visiting Jewish sites because they feel unsafe. Fear of being physically attacked for being Jewish was common among 40 percent of respondents. And for more than one in three respondents, abandoning their home country due to safety concerns is a very real consideration. Last year alone, we can find a horrifying supply of anti-Semitic abuses, and no cohesive American governmental voice to speak against them. In May, 85-year-old Holocaust survivor Mireille Knoll was brutally killed in her Paris apartment – stabbed 11 times – by two men who investigators say targeted her because she was Jewish. A July report from The Community Security Trust found 100 anti-Semitic incidents are now reported every month in Britain. Physical attacks are becoming a regular occurrence. For example, in an incident in Sussex in England, students assaulted an 11-year-old boy after a sustained verbal abuse campaign including shouts of: “death to all Jews” and “burn all Jews.” In Belgium last year, a 24-year-old man was caught on video destroying some 20 mezuzahs (small parchment scrolls inscribed with a Hebrew prayer and placed in a case affixed to doorposts of many Jewish homes). The same man also reportedly damaged the entry doors of some Jewish institutions and knocked the hat from the head of an Orthodox Jewish man. In Russia, anti-Semitic graffiti – “Jews out of Russia, our land” – was found in the hometown of the Chabad movement. In Hungary, anti-Semitic imagery was used on a magazine cover to link Jews – in this case in the form of the leader of the Jewish Federation of Hungary – to money. Incidents in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay – among other Latin American countries – include a teacher defending Adolf Hitler and endorsing anti-Semitism; vandalism against a synagogue that included arson and written threats; and an Israeli couple denied a stay at a hostel because of the owner’s anti-Israel views. Even though the United States is not part of the State Department special envoy’s mandate, our own country is no stranger to anti-Semitism. As a nation, we collectively mourned the shocking massacre of 11 worshippers at a synagogue in Pittsburgh in October. At colleges and universities, there are threats against students for defending Israel, along with calls by student government associations to have their schools undertake academic boycotts of Israel. There have even been professors who refused to offer recommendation letters to students who wanted to study in Israel. Holocaust distortion and minimization are also on the rise globally. At the same time, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement is working to undermine Israel’s legitimate rights as an international business, academic, technological and arts hub. The absence of a designated representative of the United States government calling out these incidents around the world is a glaring omission. The moral authority that the envoy’s stature has provided in the past has opened minds and created dialogue around the world. In September, we welcomed the U.S. House of Representatives passage of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism Act, which we noted would send “a clear message as anti-Semitism surges globally that the U.S. will not tolerate hatred and bigotry.” But still, the post is vacant. A U.S. anti-Semitism envoy would confer urgency on the global acceptance of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of anti-Semitism. A standard definition gives scholars, the media, authorities (in the case in dealing with hate crimes) and the general public the tools to understand anti-Semitism and more effectively combat it. In May 2016 IHRA adopted this definition: “Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.” The definition also includes as anti-Semitism: “Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.” But without a U.S. envoy to promote the definition, advocate for nations to adhere to it and encourage swift punishment for those who violate it, having such a definition loses some of its power. In 2004, the Global Anti-Semitism Review Act enabled the U.S. government to track global anti-Semitic acts and keep a record of a nation’s responses to acts within its borders. That same year, at an Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe meeting in Berlin, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell said anti-Semitism is “not just a fact of history but a current event.” Unfortunately, that is just as true 15 years later. The significance of an envoy dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism cannot be understated. It puts the United States on the record as a moral authority and unequivocally tells the world that we will not let it start down a slippery slope of tolerating the intolerable: the acceptance of anti-Semitism. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Governments still look to the United States for leadership on this issue. When they see the stature the U.S. confers on this topic through the envoy appointment, they will be more likely to follow suit. Filling this post is a matter of utmost urgency. Mark B.

Iran launched Christmas crackdown on persecuted Christian minority	"The Islamic Republic of Iran unleashed yet another crackdown on the country’s struggling Christian minority before and after Christmas, prompting international calls for help - and for much tougher action against the repressive regime. The Iranian group Alliance for Rights of All Minorities reported on December 30 that “nine Christians were arrested in Karaj, Iran on alleged charges of affiliation with Christian Zionists and recruitment of Muslims to home churches. The arrests are also based on fears that this group intends to harm Iran and insult Iran.” Just weeks earlier, Iran’s regime had carried out a crackdown on practicing Christians that resulted in the incarceration of more than 100 people, according to Open Doors UK, a Christian human rights group, and other Christian media outlets. The mass arrests were meant to intimidate Christians into not spreading their faith during the Christmas period. POMPEO, AT SITE OF OBAMA'S ADDRESS TO MUSLIM WORLD, REBUKES HIS LEGACY: 'AGE OF SELF-INFLICTED AMERICAN SHAME IS OVER “The Iranian regime has long persecuted Christians, Baha’is and other religious minorities. The recent uptick in repression, specifically targeting Christians and Christian converts, is alarming and unacceptable,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who has spoken up for persecuted Christians, told Fox News. ""The U.S. must continue to raise the cases of individual political prisoners and pressure the Iranian regime to end its gross human rights and religious freedom violations.” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tx., told FoxNews.com: “The Ayatollahs persecute Christians, and anyone else who refuses to accept their theocratic vision, because they fear freedom of conscience. Iran’s repeated and worsening persecution of Christians is unacceptable and must stop. It is imperative that we support religious liberty around the world, and work to end the persecution of Christians and people of all faiths.” The spike of persecution by Iran prompted calls for tougher international action against the regime. Alireza Nader, the CEO of New Iran, a research and advocacy organization based in Washington, D.C., told Fox News: “Europe should find new ways of improving human rights, including actively supporting the real democratic opposition forces, and not fake reformists.” He added: “Christianity may be the fastest growing religion in Iran, a fact which worries a regime fanatical about its ability to enforce a rigid conformity. The fact that so many Iranians are turning away from Islam and to Christianity means its efforts to create an ideal Islamic society has failed. ""U.S. and European leaders should publicize the plight of Christians as much as possible. The Europeans are lagging in this regard as they assume that the state of instability in Iran may somehow still be resolved by preserving JCPOA [the Iran nuclear deal] and counting on so-called Iranian reformists, who in reality are totally powerless.” VENEZUELA, IRAN AND HEZBOLLAH - ALL HOSTILE TO THE US - FORGE CLOSER TIES The 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action - better known to some as the Iran nuclear deal - aims to curtail Iran’s nuclear weapons ambitions for a limited period, in exchange for sanctions relief. The Trump administration withdrew from the JCPOA in May 2018 because the agreement failed to stop Iran’s drive to secure nuclear weapons or to halt its aggression and ballistic missie program in the Middle East, according to President Donald Trump. The persecution of Christians has continued during the presidency of the so-called moderate Hassan Rouhani. An Islamic cleric, Rouhani has claimed that “Christians have the same rights as other do,” despite international reports detailing the violent repression of Iranian Christians. In a late December sermon in Tehran that was translated by The Middle East Media Research Institute, Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami, a senior member of the Assembly of Experts, declared that “Christians should honor Jesus and chant ‘Death to America.’” There are believed to be roughly 350,000 Christians in Iran, a number that is rising as more Muslims convert to Christianity. Nasrin Amirsedghi, a leading Iranian dissident in Germany, has written and lectured on human rights violations in the Islamic Republic. She told Fox News: “This regime belongs in the dustbin in history like Nazism. Forty years! These are four lost generations, including a destroyed culture. A rich culture, author of the first human rights declaration, centuries before Christ.” IRAN ANNOUNCES PLAN TO LAUNCH 2 SATELLITES INTO ORBIT ON DOMESTICALLY MADE ROCKETS The Islamic Revolution that broke out in 1979 created a regime determined to export its brand of militant Shi’ite Islamism. Amirsedghi, who fled her country to escape persecution, said the way to “save Iran, its people, its minorities and how to pacify the Middle East is only through the formation of an ‘alliance of the willing’ who would be willing to do everything in their power not only to support the democratic calls, [but also] calls for justice, prosperity and peace of the Iranians, if necessary militarily.” “The mullahs have to go,” she said. Saba Farzan, the German-Iranian executive director of Foreign Policy Circle, a strategy think tank in Berlin, told Fox News, “The continued systematic persecution of Christians in Iran requires a tough response by the U.S. and its allies. Hard economic sanctions should be backed by a very visible campaign of naming and shaming the Iranian Islamic tyranny for denying its own citizens an absolute basic human right: freedom of religion. Especially the U.S. with its rich history of religious freedom and tolerance is seen by so many Iranians from all walks of life as a shining example. To back Iranian Christians is an important step to achieve freedom for all Iranians.

World's tallest Jesus statue coming to Mexico thanks to pro-life actor	" The world's biggest statue of Jesus is coming to one of the most dangerous parts of Mexico. Eduardo Verastegui, a prominent Mexican Catholic actor and pro-life advocate, plans to build the statue called ""Christ of Peace"" at a towering 252 feet, nearly twice the size of Rio de Janeiro's Christ the Redeemer, which stands at 125 feet in Brazil. The current record holder is Christ the King statue in Poland, which is 172 feet high. 'THANK YOU, JESUS': MAN'S TRUCK GOES UP IN FLAMES BUT BIBLE LEFT INSIDE WAS UNSCATHED The new statue of Jesus, designed by Mexican architect Fernando Romero, will depict Christ with outstretched arms as if offering a hug to His people, Mexico News Daily reported. Promoters say it will show ""a message of faith, love, hope, and peace"" to Ciudad Victoria, the capital of Tamaulipas, a state that borders Texas along the U.S.-Mexico border. The state has recently been rocked by violent confrontations between security forces and drug dealers, but Verastegui said the purpose of the project is to leave a legacy of peace in the region. Developers hope to turn the area into a thriving tourist destination and a place of pilgrimage that will be able to hold up to 10,000 people for special events. Along with the massive Jesus statue, the site will have a church, restaurants, a market, convention center, hotel, pilgrims lodging, amphitheater, commercial properties, and cable car stations along with parking. Verastegui -- who became famous in Mexico for singing, modeling and acting in telenovelas -- hopes Christ of Peace can transform the area much the same way He changed his life. STORY ABOUT LIFE OF JESUS EMERGES AS LARGEST CROWDFUNDED ENTERTAINMENT PROJECT IN HISTORY ""I understood that I was not born to be an actor or something else, but to know, love and serve Jesus Christ,"" Verastegui said in 2003 after vowing chastity and pushing an effort to make Catholic and pro-life films, one of the most successful being ""Bella.""

Six unidentified Holocaust victims to be interred at UK Jewish cemetery	"The remains of six unidentified Holocaust victims will soon have a resting place, more than 20 years after they were discovered by a survivor at the Auschwitz death camp. The remains – believed to be five adults and one child – will be given a Jewish funeral at Bushey New Cemetery in Hertfordshire, England later this month. “We have the opportunity to do what was denied to our brothers and sisters during the Holocaust: to provide a dignified and appropriate Jewish burial,” said Michael Goldstein, president of the United Synagogue, which is organizing the funeral. ENORMOUS 'PULSE OF DEATH' IN HOLOCAUST WAS WORSE THAN FEARED, RESEARCHERS FIND The remains were found in the mid-q990s and in 1997 were sent to the Imperial War Museum (IWM) in London as part of a collection of Holocaust-related items, despite the museum saying at the time they did not want the human remains, The Guardian reported. The museum, which is legally permitted to store human remains – commissioned tests on the remains, which found that they contained human bone fragments, non-human bone fragments, construction material from cremation ovens, and ash. A museum spokesperson told the Jewish Chronicle that “the donor did not provide detailed information about how they obtained the remains but stated that the remains came from Auschwitz-Birkenau, along with other items from their collection, which Auschwitz-Birkenau have confirmed originate from that site.” The English Heritage Centre for Archaeology, which conducted the tests, suggested the remains were of six people – likely five adults and a child. HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR REMEMBERS KRISTALLNACHT OR 'NIGHT OF BROKEN GLASS' 80 YEARS LATER: 'THE RUPTURE WAS COMPLETE' Last year, while taking stock of its Holocaust materials, the museum decided that the remains should be returned to the Jewish community. It contacted the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum and Chief Rabbi for advice. The United Synagogue offered to bury the victims in service – the first of its kind in the United Kingdom. “These Kedoshim [holy souls] will now be afforded the dignity of a Jewish funeral, within the loving embrace of our community – something which was denied to them and so many others during the course of the Shoah,” the Chief Rabbi’s office said in a statement. The Chief Rabbi’s office praised the museum, saying Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis is “grateful to IWM for the care and sensitivity they have shown in this matter.” The remains will be placed in shrouds in a specially prepared coffin, with earth from Israel placed on top of the shrouds. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “We must remember that although we have only the remains of a number of victims of the Shoah, each was a person in their own right, with a family and a life and a Jewish identity, with hopes and dreams just like each of us,” Goldstein said in a statement, according to The Jewish Chronicle. “One of them was a child. I will hug my own children especially tightly next Sunday.”"	nonTerrorism	Religion
"Vatican launches track team of Swiss guards, nuns to compete in international competitions"	"The Olympic Games could eventually have the Holy See flag flying among its delegations after the Vatican announced Thursday the creation of an official track team. The Vatican Athletics – the first accredited track team from the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church – will include about 60 Holy See runners of Swiss Guards, priests, nuns, pharmacists and even a 62-year-old professor who works in the Vatican’s Apostolic Library. The Vatican said it had signed an agreement with the Italian Olympic Committee with the aim of participating in international competitions including the Games of Small States of Europe – open to states with fewer than one million people – the Mediterranean games and even the Olympic Games. “The dream that we have often had is to see the Holy See flag among the delegations at the opening of the Olympic Games,” said Monsignor Melchor Jose Sanchez de Toco y Alameda, team president and the head of the Vatican’s sports department in the culture ministry. But he said that the Olympics was neither a short-term nor medium-term goal, and that for now the Vatican was looking to participate in competitions that had cultural or symbolic value. ""We might even podium,"" he noted. Michela Ciprietti, a Vatican pharmacist on the team, told a Vatican press conference that the team’s aim isn’t only competing, but to “promote culture and running and launch the message of solidarity and the fight against racism and violence of all types.” The Vatican said it also hopes to sign similar agreements with the Italian Paralympic Committee. BATTLE OF WILLS: TINY ORDER OF FRENCH NUNS TAKES ON VATICAN Giovanni Malago, president of CONI (the Italian National Olympic Committee) welcomes the birth of the Vatican team – though jokingly warned that they might cost Italy a medal in the future. “Just don’t get too big,” he said at the team’s launch,  recalling how an athlete from another tiny country — Majlinda Kelmendi — won Kosovo's first Olympic medal when she defeated Italian rival Odette Giuffrida in the final of the women's 52-kilogram judo event at the Rio Games in 2016. In recent years, the Vatican has fielded unofficial soccer teams and a cricket team in efforts to forge relations with the Anglican church through annual tours in Britain.

"Christian persecution set to rise ‘sharply’ in 2019, group warns"	"An international Christian organization is warning that the persecution of Christians worldwide is set to rise in 2019 -- and it's calling on the United States to do more to help. Release International, a U.K.-based charity that helps supports persecuted Christians around the world and a partner organization of Voice of the Martyrs, warns that this year, particularly in China, India, and Nigeria, persecution against Christians is rising. ""These are countries that have long been on the list but we’re seeing an upwards curve, an alarming rise in persecution,"" Andrew Boyd, Release International spokesman, told Fox News. ""Release has been doing this work for 50 years,"" Boyd added. ""I have no doubt that persecution is increasing and it is alarming and the contexts are different. You have militant Islam in Nigeria; China, which is communism; India, which is militant Hinduism; North Korea which is a weird blend of communism and Emporer worship. There is an increasing intolerance and it’s being played out in violence and we know it because of the reports that are coming from our partners on the ground."" CHRISTIAN PERSECUTION CONTINUES TO RISE, MORE INCIDENTS AGAINST WOMEN IN 2017, NEW REPORT SAYS Other countries of specific concern for 2019 include North Korea, Eritrea, and Pakistan, where Christian Asia Bibi is still not free to leave, despite being acquitted of blasphemy. In Nigeria, Fulani militants look set to continue devastating attacks against Christians in the north and central Nigeria. In the first six months of 2018 alone, they killed up to 6,000 and drove 50,000 from their homes. “So if you take Nigeria, everybody knows about Boko Haran, but hugely unreported are Fulani militants, Muslim herdsman, being armed and they are attacking Christian villages in the north of the country and the tactics that they are using appear to be well coordinated and planned,” Boyd said, adding they are a ""much, much more serious menace than Boko Haran."" In one particular example, ""the Fulani would fire shots at night and lie in wait with machetes for them – these are men, women, and children – we’re dealing with lots of orphans, some of them who are heavily scarred…and the government seems to be doing very little."" China has seen a sharp increase in government opposition to religion, including Christianity, as the Chinese government has destroyed crosses, burned Bibles, closed churches, and is forcing believers to sign papers renouncing their faith in Beijing and several other provinces, demanding loyalty to the atheist Communist party in power. ""Tough new laws were brought in 2018, and we’ve seen high profile unregistered churches, house churches, are now being closed down,"" Boyd said. ""Our partners are saying the Chinese government is now emboldened because of the lack of protests from the West."" One of their partners said the government is trying to ""reduce Christianity to just a minor activity by unimportant older people."" In India, attacks against Christians are coming from Hindu nationalists that are on the rise. They see no place for Muslims or Christians in India and has only been emboldened since the government of India Prime Minister Narendra Modi took power in 2014, the group said. There has been a rise in attacks on pastors and prayer meetings being broken up, as several states in the nation are passing anti-conversion laws. One pastor told Release he was thrown off a moving train for carrying Bibles in a rucksack. His attackers yelled, ""These people are spoiling our religion!"" and threw him on to the platform. They fractured his skull, shoulder bone, and ankle, and knocked out several teeth. The pastor continues to preach the gospel despite opposition from hard-liners, the group said.

Sunday's opening ceremony is a highly symbolic gesture at a time when Islamic militants are increasingly targeting the country's minority Christians. Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, a general-turned-president, has made sectarian harmony a cornerstone of his rule, fighting Islamic militancy while advocating equality between the overwhelming Muslim majority and Christians, who account for about 10 percent of Egypt's 100 million people. The cathedral and mosque were built in Egypt's New Administrative Capital, el-Sissi's brainchild, in the desert east of Cairo.

Ukraine Orthodox Church granted independence from Russian Church	" The recently formed Orthodox Church of Ukraine has officially grained independence, severing its relationship to the Russian Church that it had been tied to for more than 330 years. The Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, Bartholomew I, signed the “Tomos” in Istanbul Saturday in front of clerics and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, formalizing a split that has angered Moscow amid a broader poliitical conflict between Ukraine and Russia, NPR reported. “The pious Ukrainian people have awaited this blessed day for seven entire centuries,” Bartholomew I said in his address. The ceremony formalized an October announcement to undo a connection that began in 1686. Poroshenko thanked Bartholomew I “for the courage to make this historic decision” and said that “among the 15 stars of the Orthodox churches of the world a Ukrainian star has appeared,” referring to the updated number of churches that don’t answer to an external authority. Metropolitan Epiphanius I, who was elected last month by Ukrainian Orthodox leaders to head the new church, will take the decree to Kiev. Criticism continued Saturday when a spokesman for the Russia-affiliated church in Ukraine, Vasily Anisimov, said, “We consider these actions to be anti-canonical ... This action will not bring anything to Ukraine except trouble, separation and sin,” according to Russian state news agency RIA-Novosti. Rancor between Ukraine and Russia grew after Moscow’s seizure of Crimea in 2014. Reuters reported that Ukraine imposed martial law in November, citing the threat of a full-scale invasion after Russia captured three of its vessels in the Kerch Strait.

Vatican: Argentine bishop at Holy See under investigation	" The Vatican has confirmed that an Argentine bishop, who resigned suddenly in 2017 for stated health reasons and then landed a top administrative job at the Holy See, is under preliminary investigation after priests accused him of sexual abuse and other misconduct. In a statement to The Associated Press, Vatican spokesman Alessandro Gisotti stressed that the allegations against Bishop Gustavo Zanchetta only emerged in recent months, nearly a year after Pope Francis created the new position for him as ""assessor"" of the Holy See's office of financial administration. At the time of his July 2017 resignation, Zanchetta had only asked Francis to let him leave the northern Argentine diocese of Oran because he had difficult relations with its priests and was ""unable to govern the clergy,"" Gisotti said. Pending the preliminary investigation into allegations of sexual abuse underway in Argentina, the 54-year-old Zanchetta will abstain from work at the Vatican, he said. But the case could become yet another problem for Francis, who is already battling to gain trust from the Catholic flock over his handling of sex abuse and sexual misconduct, stemming in particular from the scandal of ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick. Francis' standing would take another hit if he personally intervened to help out a bishop from his native Argentina — finding a job for him during a Vatican hiring hold-down — and the man later turned out to have credible allegations of misconduct against him. Zanchetta's hasty departure from Oran on July 29, 2017 was mired in mystery. He didn't celebrate a farewell Mass, as might be expected, and he issued a cryptic statement saying he had been suffering a ""health problem"" for some time, had just returned from the Vatican where he presented his resignation to Francis, and needed to leave immediately for treatment. A statement issued the same day from his vicar general said Zanchetta had already left Oran, a deeply conservative and poor diocese near Argentina's northern border with Bolivia that Zanchetta had run since Francis made him a bishop in 2013 in one of his first Argentine episcopal appointments. Zanchetta, the vicar said at the time, would be staying in Corrientes — several hundred kilometers (miles) away — as a guest of the archbishop until Francis accepted his resignation. Often such procedures can take months, but the Vatican announced Francis had accepted it three days later, on Aug. 1. Zanchetta then disappeared from view until Dec. 19, 2017, when the Vatican announced that he had been named assessor of APSA, the office that manages the Vatican's vast real estate and other financial holdings. The appointment immediately raised eyebrows, but Zanchetta appeared nevertheless to have settled in well at APSA, and Gisotti said Francis appointed him because he had an established capacity for administrative management. It wasn't immediately clear what Zanchetta's health problems were at the time of his resignation, but by all indications there were grave problems with his leadership and divisions within the diocesan clergy. ""The reason for his resignation is linked to his difficulty in handling relations with the diocesan clergy, some of which were very tense,"" Gisotti said. ""At the time of his resignation there were accusations against him of authoritarianism, but there were no accusations of sexual abuse against him."" Zanchetta spent a period of time in Spain before joining APSA. The allegations were leveled internally in recent months, Gisotti said, and last week the provincial newspaper in Salta, El Tribuno, reported that three priests had brought accusations against him to the Vatican's ambassador, or nuncio, in Buenos Aires. The newspaper said the priests had lodged accusations of abuse of power, economic abuse and sexual abuse inside the seminary. It wasn't immediately clear how Zanchetta responded to the accusations. The current bishop of Oran, which is in Salta province, is still gathering evidence and testimony and will forward it to the Vatican, Gisotti said. If the allegations are deemed credible, the case will be forwarded to Francis' special commission for bishops — an ad hoc group of canon lawyers who have been examining allegations of misconduct against bishops. The issue of sexual abuse within seminaries has risen to the forefront in the scandal over McCarrick, the retired archbishop of Washington. Francis removed McCarrick as a cardinal in July after a U.S. church investigation determined that an allegation that he fondled an altar boy in the 1970s was credible. After the allegation became public, several former seminarians came forward to report they had been abused or harassed by McCarrick and pressured to sleep with him. Francis became implicated in the McCarrick scandal after a former Vatican ambassador accused him of knowing of McCarrick's penchant for seminarians, and rehabilitating him anyway from sanctions imposed by Pope Benedict XVI. Francis hasn't responded. Zanchetta had opened his own seminary in Oran in 2016 with six seminarians. According to El Tribuno, the St. John XXIII seminary is due to close soon. The diocese hasn't responded to questions about Zanchetta's departure or the status of the investigation against him. It has, however, issued a statement responding to media reports that the priests who lodged complaints against Zanchetta had suffered retaliation. The new bishop of Oran said the priests had been transferred to respond to the pastoral needs of the faithful. ""Knowing the gravity of all types of abuse, the bishop is available to anyone who would like to present a complaint to begin the corresponding procedure for canonical justice, while recalling the right of all victims of abuse to seek ordinary justice,"" via civil authorities, the statement said."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Hindu hardliners clash with police over women at shrine	" Hindu hardliners vandalized shops, shut businesses and clashed with police in a southern state Thursday to protest the entry of two women in one of India's largest Hindu pilgrimage sites, police said. Police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the protesters who also blocked roads by placing burning tires and concrete blocks in key towns, including Kozhikode, Kannur, Malappuram, Palakkad and Thiruvananthapuram. Pinarayi Vijayan, the state's top elected official, accused supporters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party of triggering violence that reportedly claimed one life. Most state-run buses kept off roads after several were damaged by protesters. Supporters of Modi's party held protest marches in the state as part of a strike call by Sabarimala Karma Samithi, an umbrella organization of Hindu groups. The two women entered the temple to pray early Wednesday, triggering protests. They were escorted by police because it is ""the government's constitutional responsibility to give protection to women,"" Vijayan said. Women of menstruating age were forbidden to pray at the temple until the Supreme Court lifted the ban in September. The ban was informal for many years but became law in 1972. Some devotees have filed a petition saying the court decision revoking the ban was an affront to the celibate deity Ayyappa. Vijayan said Thursday that 39 police officers were injured while trying to control the protesters, who damaged 79 state-run buses in the state. The Press Trust of India news agency reported that a 55-year-old passer-by died after being injured amid rock throwing by protesters in Pandalam."	nonTerrorism	Religion
"Sudan under al-Bashir: Long history of turmoil, conflicts"	"Street protests against Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir show no sign of abating. A growing number of his former allies are clamoring for his departure. None of his friends in the region are stepping up to help. One of the Mideast's longest autocrats may be on the way out. But if al-Bashir, who came to power in a 1989 military coup, seeks to cling to power, it could mean greater violence and economic paralysis for Sudan and a new stage in a dark history of strife, military dictatorships and political polarization. Once Africa's largest nation, Sudan under al-Bashir was prominent on the world stage in the 1990s and 2000s for all the wrong reasons. It was the scene of a long civil war between the mostly Christian and animist south and the Muslim and Arabized north. It hosted Osama bin Laden in the early years of his jihadi movement that led to the creation of al-Qaida, landing Sudan a spot on the U.S. list of countries backing terrorism. In the 2000s, it was most known for the brutal repression of an uprising in its western Darfur region, when the pro-government militias known as the Janjaweed became notorious for atrocities and al-Bashir himself was indicted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes and genocide. After the south gained independence in 2011 in a referendum that al-Bashir agreed to in a peace treaty, Sudan lost a third of its territory and fell out of the international spotlight. In the years since, it languished in increasing economic misery. That misery erupted several times into protests, each time put down by al-Bashir. He has tried to do the same in the latest unrest, sparked on Dec. 19, initially over steep price rises and shortages. Dozens have been reported killed, and al-Bashir has arrested opposition leaders, imposed emergency rule and curfews in multiple cities and suspended classes in schools and universities. Here is a look at Sudan's modern history and how recent events may shape its future: HOW DID SUDAN GET HERE? Since independence in 1956, Sudan has bounced between tumultuous party politics and military rule, while trying to hold together a north and south joined under British colonialism. Southern rebels took up arms the year before independence, starting the first civil war. In 1958, the military seized power, ruling for six years until a wave of riots and strikes in 1964. Elections were held, and a series of governments took office, all of which failed to end the war or agree on a permanent constitution. Army officer Jaafar al-Nimeiri led another military coup in 1969. He dissolved parliament and outlawed political parties, starting 16 years of authoritarian rule. He fended off several coup attempts, including one by Communists in 1971 and another by followers of Imam al-Mahdi, a messianic religious figure from the late 1800s. In 1972, he reached a peace deal ending the war in the south. The south relaunched its insurgency 11 years later and the guerillas' ranks swelled when al-Nimeiri introduced Islamic Shariah law. After a popular uprising, the military removed al-Nimeiri in 1985 and — in a rare move for the region — quickly handed power to an elected government. The dysfunctional administration lasted only a few years until al-Bashir — a career army officer — allied with Islamist hard-liners and toppled it in a coup. Bashir's 29 years in power will likely be remembered as the most oppressive in Sudan's modern history. He began by trying to militarily crush the southern rebellion. Predictably, it did not work. From Khartoum, his rule was based on his Islamist-military alliance, presenting himself as a leader of the 1990s wave of ""political Islam"" while building ties with violent jihadis. Using Islamist ideology as a rallying cry, al-Bashir created loyalist militias to protect his rule and built a political machine of businessmen and politicians that held a lock on power and amassed massive wealth in the impoverished nation. His renewed imposition of Islamic law alienated many and tore apart the social fabric of a country with a rich religious and ethnic composition. His use of Islamic militias in Darfur made him an international pariah. Partly trying to salvage his standing, he signed the peace deal with the south. But as it gained independence, the south took with it three quarters of Sudan's oil resources, leaving the north without an economic engine. Since then, al-Bashir's main priorities have been keeping his lock on power while floundering for ways to repair the economy. He has manipulated shifting international alliances, playing regional powers against each other in hopes of financial aid and investment. His relations with Egypt, Sudan's powerful neighbor to the north, are a case in point. Sudan has sided with Ethiopia in a dispute with Egypt over an Ethiopian dam being built, seen by Cairo as a threat to its share of Nile River water — and al-Bashir stoked an old border dispute with Egypt. But then he had to quickly try mend relations with Egypt after Sudan's economic crisis worsened with the devaluation of its currency in October. Al-Bashir has also cultivated oil-rich Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, receiving extensive aid after he sent troops to Yemen to fight alongside the two against Shiite Houthi rebels. But their trust — and Egypt's — has been undermined by his wooing of their rivals, Qatar, Turkey and Iran. Al-Bashir's domestic alliances have shown signs of crumbling in the face of the latest protests. The military and police are sitting on the fence. Political groups, including Islamists who were once allied with his National Congress Party have joined street calls for him to step down. Those defections undermine al-Bashir's faltering response to the crisis, which he has tried to depict as a struggle against secularists backed by Western plots aimed at wrecking Sudan's Islamist ""experiment."" He has used religious rhetoric, telling a public struggling to get by that God will provide and quoting Quran verses to security officials in an attempt to justify killing protesters. He has options for political survival, but likely at the price of reducing his powers. He formed an investigation committee that could try to give him cover by prosecuting some accused of using lethal force against protesters or indicting businessmen and politicians for manipulated the market for personal gain. He may also try bringing political rivals into a new, inclusive government, or announce he will not run in elections set for 2020. But he also may dig in, forcing the military and police to choose whether to back him or turn against him definitively, prompting new turmoil."	nonTerrorism	Religion

" 2 women enter Hindu temple, breaking years-long ban"	" Two women on Wednesday entered one of India's largest Hindu pilgrimage sites that had been forbidden to females between the ages of 10 and 50, sparking protests across a southern state, with police firing tear gas in at least one place, police said. The Supreme Court lifted a ban in September on women worshipping at Sabarimala temple in Kerala state. The ban was informal for many years, but became law in 1972. Despite the ruling, demonstrators including Hindu priests and conservatives continued to block women of menstruating age from entering the centuries-old temple. The two women in their forties entered the temple early Wednesday and worshipped there, said Pramod Kumar, the state police spokesman. Officers escorted the two women to the hilltop temple because of ""police responsibility to provide protection to any devotee irrespective of gender,"" Kumar said. Kerala's top elected official, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, told reporters that under the Supreme Court order, police were bound to safeguard worshippers. ""Earlier, women were not able to enter the temple due to certain hurdles. They were able to enter the shrine today,"" Vijayan said. Protests broke out in several places in the state after the women entered the temple, and police fired tear gas to disperse at least one of them. There were no immediate reports of injuries. On Tuesday, millions of women formed a human chain more than 600 kilometers (375 miles) long from Kasargod in the northern part of the state to Thiruvananthapuram, the southernmost city and the state capital, to support gender equality. The Communist Party of India (Marxist), the ruling party in Kerala, said about 5.5 million women participated in the protest, called by the state government. The Supreme Court has agreed to re-examine its decision to lift the ban later this month in response to 49 petitions filed against it. Opponents of the ruling say the celibacy of the temple's presiding deity, Lord Ayyappa, is protected by India's Constitution, and that women of all ages can worship at other Hindu temples. Some Hindus consider menstruating women to be impure."	nonTerrorism	Religion
AP Exclusive: India's hidden years of nuns abused by priests	" The stories spill out in the sitting rooms of Catholic convents, where portraits of Jesus keep watch and fans spin quietly overhead. They spill out in church meeting halls bathed in fluorescent lights, and over cups of cheap instant coffee in convent kitchens. Always, the stories come haltingly, quietly. Sometimes, the nuns speak at little more than a whisper. Across India, the nuns talk of priests who pushed into their bedrooms and of priests who pressured them to turn close friendships into sex. They talk about being groped and kissed, of hands pressed against them by men they were raised to believe were representatives of Jesus Christ. ""He was drunk,"" said one nun, beginning her story. ""You don't know how to say no,"" said another. At its most grim, the nuns speak of repeated rapes, and of a Catholic hierarchy that did little to protect them. The Vatican has long been aware of nuns sexually abused by priests and bishops in Asia, Europe, South America and Africa, but it has done very little to stop it, The Associated Press reported last year. Now, the AP has investigated the situation in a single country — India — and uncovered a decades-long history of nuns enduring sexual abuse from within the church. Nuns described in detail the sexual pressure they endured from priests, and nearly two dozen other people — nuns, former nuns and priests, and others — said they had direct knowledge of such incidents. Still, the scale of the problem in India remains unclear, cloaked by a powerful culture of silence. Many nuns believe abuse is commonplace, insisting most sisters can at least tell of fending off a priest's sexual advances. Some believe it is rare. Almost none, though, talk about it readily, and most speak only on the condition they not be identified. But this summer, one Indian nun forced the issue into the open. When repeated complaints to church officials brought no response, the 44-year-old nun filed a police complaint against the bishop who oversees her religious order, accusing him of raping her 13 times over two years. Soon after, a group of her fellow nuns launched a two-week public protest in India's Catholic heartland, demanding the bishop's arrest. It was an unprecedented action, dividing India's Catholic community. Inside the accuser's convent in rural Kerala state, she and the nuns who support her are now pariahs, isolated from the other sisters, many of whom insist the bishop is innocent. The protesting nuns get hate mail and avoid going out. ""Some people are accusing us of working against the church, of being against the church. They say, 'You are worshipping Satan,'"" said one supporter, Sister Josephine Villoonnickal. ""But we need to stand up for the truth."" Villoonnickal has been a nun for 23 years, joining when she was a teenager. She scoffs at the idea that she wants to harm the church. ""We want to die as sisters,"" she said. Some nuns' accounts date back decades — like that of the sister, barely out of her teens, who was teaching in a Catholic school in the early 1990s. It was exhausting work, and she was looking forward to the chance to reflect on what had led her — happily — to convent life. ""We have kind of a retreat before we renew our vows,"" she said, sitting in the painfully neat sitting room of her big-city convent, where doilies cover most every surface, chairs are lined up in rows and the blare of horns drifts in through open windows. ""We take one week off and we go for prayers and silence."" She had traveled to a New Delhi retreat center, a collection of concrete buildings where she gathered with other young nuns. A priest was there to lead the sisters in reflection. The nun, who like others interviewed for this story spoke on condition she not be identified, is a strong and forceful woman who has spent years working with India's poor and dispossessed, from battered wives to evicted families. But when she talks about the retreat her voice grows quiet, as if she's afraid to be overheard in the empty room: ""I felt this person, maybe he had some thoughts, some attraction."" He was in his 60s. She was four decades younger. One night, the priest went to a neighborhood party. He came back late, after 9:30 p.m., and knocked at her room. ""'I need to meet you,'"" he said when she cracked open the door, insisting he wanted to discuss her spiritual life. She could smell the alcohol. ""You're not stable. I'm not ready to meet you,"" she told him. But the priest forced open the door. He tried to kiss her. He grabbed at her body, groping wherever he could. Weeping, she pushed him back enough to slam the door and lock it. It wasn't rape. She knows it could have been so much worse. But decades later she still reels at the memory, and this tough woman, for a few moments, looks like a scared young girl: ""It was such a terrifying experience."" Afterward she quietly told her mother superior, who allowed her to avoid other meetings with the priest. She also wrote an anonymous letter to church officials, which she thinks may have led to the priest being re-assigned. But nothing was said aloud. There were no public reprimands, no warnings to the many nuns the priest would work with through his long career. She was too afraid to challenge him openly. ""I couldn't imagine taking that stand. It was too scary,"" she said. ""For me it was risking my own vocation."" Catholic history is filled with women who became martyrs to their own purity: Saint Agatha had her breasts torn off for refusing to marry; Saint Lucy was burned alive and stabbed in the throat for defending her virginity; Saint Maria Goretti was 11 years old when she was killed by a man who tried to rape her. ""It is a sin!"" Maria is said to have cried out. ""God does not want it!"" But for a nun, fighting off a priest's advances means pinballing through centuries-old sexual and clerical traditions. Celibacy is a cornerstone of Catholic religious life, as is sexual purity among nuns. Many nuns say a sister who admits to a sexual experience — even if it's forced — faces the risk of isolation within her order, and possibly even expulsion. ""You're not sure if you'll be kept in your congregation, because so much is about your vow of chastity,"" said Sister Shalini Mulackal, a New Delhi-based theologian. ""That fear is there for the young ones to disclose what has happened to them."" At the same time, priests are seen as living representatives of Christ, with obedience to them another Catholic cornerstone. Then there is the isolation of young women struggling to find their way in new communities after leaving their homes. Caught at this intersection of sexual taboo, Catholic hierarchy and loneliness, sisters can be left at the mercy of predatory priests. ""There's a lot of emotion bottled up and when a little tenderness is shown by somebody it can be so easy for you to cross boundaries,"" said Sister Dorothy Fernandes, who has spent years working with the urban poor in eastern India. ""It can be hard to tell what is love and what is exploitation."" It's particularly hard for sisters from Kerala, a deeply conservative region long the birthplace of most Indian nuns. Sex is rarely mentioned openly in small-town Kerala, boys and girls are largely kept apart, and a visible bra strap can be a minor crisis for a young woman. ""Once you grow up, once you get your first menstruation, you are not encouraged to speak normally to a boy. And the boys also vice-versa,"" said a nun from Kerala, a cheerful woman with sparkly glass earrings and an easy smile. She remembers the misery of Sunday mass as an adolescent, when boys would stand outside the church to watch girls filing in, eyes crawling over their young figures. ""We have a terrible taboo about sex."" That naivety, she said, can be costly. Like the time she was a novice nun, still in her teens, and an older priest came to the Catholic center where she worked. He was from Goa, a coastal region and former Portuguese colony. She shook her head: ""I was in charge of visitors, and we had this bad habit of being hospitable."" At one point, she brought the priest's laundry to his small room, where he was sitting. As she set down the clothes, he grabbed her and began to kiss her. At first, she had no idea what was happening. ""The kissing was all coming here,"" she said, gesturing at her chest. The confusion of that day is still clear on her face: ""I was young. He was from Goa. I am from Kerala. In my mind I was trying to figure out: 'Is this the way that Goans kiss?'"" She quickly understood what was happening but couldn't escape his fierce grip. She also could not call out for help: ""I cannot shout! He's a priest."" ""I didn't want to offend him. I didn't want to make him feel bad,"" she said. So she pushed herself away from him until she could slip out the door. She quietly told a senior nun to not send novices to the priest's room. But, like the nun who fought the drunken priest, she made no official complaint. A complaint against a priest means leveling an accusation against someone higher in the church hierarchy. It can mean getting pulled into a tangle of malicious rumors and church politics. It means risking your reputation, and the reputation of your order. In the church, even some of those who doubt there is widespread abuse of nuns say the silence can be enveloping. Archbishop Kuriakose Bharanikulangara, a New Delhi-based church leader, calls incidents of abuse ""kind of sporadic. Once here, once there."" But ""many people don't want to talk,"" he continued. ""They may talk in the community, but they don't want to bring it to the public, to the court."" Speaking up can also risk financial troubles, since many congregations of nuns are financially subservient to priests and bishops. The silence is magnified in India by demographics, religious politics and a deep-seated belief that women have little value. There are roughly 18 million Catholics in India, but that's a small minority in this largely Hindu nation of 1.3 billion. Speaking up could tarnish the image of their church, many nuns worry, and feed criticism by Hindu hardliners. ""Even we, as religious sisters, even we try to keep it quiet,"" said Mulackal, the theologian. ""A woman who goes through this experience, she just wants to hide it and pretend everything is OK."" The rapes, the nun says, happened in Room 20 of a small convent at the end of a one-lane road in rural Kerala. Set amid rows of banana and rubber trees near the little town of Kuravilangad, the sisters at the St. Francis Mission Home spend their days in prayer or caring for the aged. In the garden, a statue of the Virgin Mary overlooks a decorative fish pond the size of a child's wading pool. The pond is covered in green scum. The rapist, she says, was the most powerful man in this tiny small world: Bishop Franco Mulakkal. Smart and ambitious, Mulakkal had risen from small-town Kerala to become a bishop in north India, overseeing a sprawling Catholic community. He was also the official patron of her community of 81 sisters, the Missionaries of Jesus, wielding immense influence over its budgets and job assignments. The nun is a friendly woman with jet black hair known for her quiet confidence. Every few months, she says, Mulakkal would visit the St. Francis convent and summon her. Then, according to a letter she wrote to church officials, he raped her. The letter says the first rape happened on May 5, 2014. The last time was Sept. 23, 2016. The dates are recorded in the convent's visitor logs. Mulakkal angrily denies the accusations, telling reporters the charges were ""baseless and concocted"" and accusing the sister of trying to blackmail him into giving her a better job. ""I am going through painful agony,"" said Mulakkal, who was jailed for three weeks and released on bail in October. ""I tell everyone to pray to God: Let the truth prevail."" Catholicism envelopes this part of Kerala. Towns are marked by their cathedrals, convents and roadside shrines, where the Virgin watches passing traffic or St. George slays the dragon. Businesses proclaim their owners' faith: St. Mary's Furniture and Bed Center; Ave Maria Electronics; Jesus Oil Industries. Around here, many see Mulakkal as a martyr. A string of supporters visited him in jail, and crowds greeted him when he returned home, a ring of policemen holding back people who showered him with flower petals. ""Hearty Welcome!"" a banner proclaimed. But at the St. Francis convent, one group of nuns watched news reports about that welcome with dismay. While the sister leveling the accusations against Mulakkal does not speak publicly, a half-dozen nuns cluster around her, offering support and speaking on her behalf. ""Nobody came to see sister, but so many people came to wait in line to meet Bishop Franco in jail,"" said Villoonnickal, the nun, who moved back to Kerala to support the woman she calls ""our survivor sister."" That sister was the second of five children in a Kerala family. Her father was in the army. Her mother died when she was in high school. Wracked with grief, she was sent to stay with a cousin - a priest - living in north India. Inspired by her time with him, she became a nun in 1994, working in her early years as a teacher. She knew Mulakkal, of course. Everyone in the Missionaries of Jesus knows him. But the two were never close, the accuser's friends say, and had no consensual sexual relationship. It was about fear. ""The bishop is such a powerful person and standing against him, where will she go?"" asked Villoonnickal. ""If she went home what will happen to her?"" ""Many times she was telling him to stop. But each time he was forcing himself on her,"" she continued. Eventually, they say, she told some sisters what was happening. Then she says she repeatedly complained to church authorities. When nothing happened, she went to the police. She also went to confession. There, according to the other nuns, she was told she had to resist the bishop. ""'Even if you have to die, don't submit yourself.'"" the priest told her in confession, according to Villoonnickal. ""'Be courageous.'"" Catholic authorities have said little about the case, with India's Catholic Bishops' Conference saying in an October statement that it has no jurisdiction over individual bishops, and that the investigation and court case, which could take many years, must run their course. ""Silence should in no way be construed as siding with either of the two parties,"" the group said. ""We request prayers for the Church at this difficult time."" In Malayalam, the language of Kerala, sisters who leave the convent are sometimes marked as ""Madhilu Chadi"" — Wall Jumpers. It's a mocking term for the sexually frustrated and is often used for nuns and priests who have fled religious life. Those who stay get respect. They have communities that embrace them. Their lives have direction, purpose. Those who leave often find themselves adrift in India, searching for new identities and spurned by families and friends. The events that knit families together — weddings, funerals, reunions — are suddenly off-limits. The emotional toll can be immense. Speaking up about the church's troubles, many nuns say, could end with them forced from their convents, cut off in many ways from what they've always known. ""It's a fear of being isolated if I speak the truth,"" said the nun who fought off the drunken priest. ""If you do that, you have to go against your own community, your own religious superiors."" The result is an engulfing silence. Silence is the armor that sisters use to protect themselves and the lives they have created, even if it also means struggling with their memories, and protecting the men who abused them. In the end, most say nothing. ""I didn't tell anybody,"" said the nun who escaped the priest kissing her chest, and who waited many years to talk about what had happened to her. ""So you understand how these things are covered up."""	nonTerrorism	Religion

That naivety, she said, can be costly. Like the time she was a novice nun, still in her teens, and an older priest came to the Catholic center where she worked. He was from Goa, another coastal state. When she brought the priest his laundry, he grabbed her and began to kiss her. ""The kissing was all coming here,"" she said, gesturing at her chest. ""He was from Goa. I am from Kerala. In my mind I was trying to figure out: 'Is this the way that Goans kiss?'"" She soon understood what was happening but couldn't escape his grip. Eventually, she slipped out the door. She quietly told a senior nun to not send other novices to the priest's room. But she made no official complaint. In the church, even some of those who doubt there is widespread abuse of nuns say the silence can be enveloping. Archbishop Kuriakose Bharanikulangara calls abuse ""kind of sporadic. Once here, once there."" But ""many people don't want to talk,"" he continued. The rapes, the nun says, happened in a small convent in rural Kerala, where the sisters at the St. Francis Mission Home spend their days in prayer or caring for the aged. The rapist, she says, was the most powerful man in this world: Bishop Franco Mulakkal. Mulakkal was the official patron of her community, the Missionaries of Jesus, wielding immense influence over its budgets and job assignments. Every few months, the nun says, Mulakkal would visit the convent. Then, according to a letter she wrote church officials, he raped her. Mulakkal angrily denies the accusations, accusing the sister of trying to blackmail him to get a better job. ""I am going through painful agony,"" said Mulakkal, who was jailed for three weeks and released on bail in October. Many in Kerala see Mulakkal as a martyr, and a string of supporters visited him in jail. The sisters who now cluster around the nun who leveled the accusations see things very differently. ""Many times she was telling him to stop. But each time he was forcing himself on her,"" said Villoonnickal, the nun, who moved back to Kerala to support ""our survivor sister."" Catholic authorities have said little about the case, with India's Catholic Bishops' Conference saying in a statement that it has no jurisdiction over individual bishops, and the investigation and court case must run their course. ""Silence,"" the conference said, ""should in no way be construed as siding with either of the two parties."""	nonTerrorism	Religion
Attorney says Egyptian activist to return to jail any time	"An Egyptian activist expects to return to prison ""at any time"" after an appeals court upheld a two-year sentence against her for posting a video online in which she criticized the government and decried sexual harassment, her attorney said Tuesday. Lawyer Doaa Moustafa said the Misdemeanor Court of Appeals in Cairo's Maadi suburb, on Sunday upheld Amal Fathy's sentence for insulting employees in a bank and using abusive language to criticize state institutions and decry sexual harassment against women. Fathy had been sentenced in September, but her sentence was suspended on appeal after she paid 10,000 Egyptian pounds ($560). However, she was not released on house arrest until Dec. 27 pending an investigation into separate charges. Now, she expects to be taken into custody ""at any time,"" following the court's Sunday ruling, Moustafa said. Moustafa said Fathy can still appeal her original two-year sentence before the Court of Cassation, Egypt's final recourse for appeals in criminal cases. Rights group Amnesty International decried Sunday's court ruling, saying it was an ""outrageous case of injustice."" ""The fact that a survivor of sexual harassment is being punished with a two-year prison sentence simply for speaking out about her experience is utterly disgraceful. This verdict makes a mockery of justice and should be a stain on the conscience of the Egyptian authorities,"" said Najia Bounaim, Amnesty International's North Africa director, in a statement Sunday. Bounaim added: ""The timing of the verdict is particularly cruel, coming only days after Amal was reunited with her loved ones."" Fathy was released last week pending an investigation into charges including disseminating false news, misuse of social media networks to spread material that could hurt security and the public interest and joining an outlawed group. ""Membership in an outlawed group"" is Egyptian government parlance for having ties to a range of groups that it has outlawed, including the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist organization authorities have banned, labeling it a terrorist group. Under terms of her house arrest, Fathy must report to a nearby police station weekly and is allowed to leave only to pick up medication or visit a police station or court. Police arrested Fathy in May after she posted a 12-minute video online criticizing the state for deteriorating public services and not taking measures against sexual harassment. She said she was harassed at a local branch of a state-owned bank. The video also shows her using profanities to describe her experience at the bank and repeatedly insulting the state. Fathy is a former activist in the pro-democracy April 6 Movement, which was at the forefront of the 2011 the 2011 uprising that toppled longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak. Egyptian authorities have waged a campaign against activists who speak out against the government. Since leading the military's 2013 overthrow of an elected but divisive president — the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohammed Morsi — President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has overseen a crackdown on dissent. Authorities have jailed thousands of Islamists along with secular, pro-democracy advocates, imposing tight controls over the media and rolling back freedoms won in a popular 2011 uprising. El-Sissi says his government's top priorities are security and overhauling the battered economy."	nonTerrorism	Religion
 Vatican spokesman and his deputy resign suddenly	"The Vatican spokesman, Greg Burke, and his deputy resigned suddenly Monday amid an overhaul of the Vatican's communications operations that coincides with a troubled period in Pope Francis' papacy. In a tweet, Burke said he and his deputy, Paloma Garcia Ovejero, had resigned effective Jan. 1. Francis accepted the resignation Monday, the Vatican said in a statement. ""At this time of transition in Vatican communications, we think it's best the Holy Father is completely free to assemble a new team,"" Burke wrote. He and Garcia both thanked the pope. ""A stage is ending. Thank you for these two and a half years,"" Garcia tweeted. Francis named a longtime member of the Vatican's communications operations, Alessandro Gisotti, as an interim replacement. The pope has recently overhauled the Vatican's media operations for the second time by ousting the longtime editor of the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano and naming a new director of editorial content for all Vatican media, the Italian journalist Andrea Tornielli. The resignations clearly took the new team by surprise. The head of Vatican communications, Paolo Ruffini, said he had learned of the decision by Burke and Garcia and respected it. He praised their professionalism and said he had full confidence in Gisotti, who had been a longtime journalist with Vatican Radio and more recently had been head of social media for the Vatican. ""The year ahead is full of important appointments that will require maximum communications efforts,"" Ruffini said in a statement. It was perhaps a reference to Francis' high-stakes summit on preventing clergy sex abuse in February, as well as his multiple foreign trips planned for 2019: Panama, United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Bulgaria and Macedonia in the first half of the year, and rumored trips to Madagascar and Japan in the second half. Francis also has to deal with continued fallout from the clergy abuse scandal, in Chile, the U.S. and beyond. The next year will likely see the outcome of a canonical investigation into ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, accused of sexually abusing minors and adult seminarians, as well as the results of a Vatican investigation into McCarrick's rise through church ranks. Burke, then a Fox TV correspondent in Rome, was hired as a communications adviser for the Vatican's secretariat of state in 2012. At the time, the papacy of Pope Benedict XVI had suffered a series of communications blunders, and it was thought that Burke could provide guidance. In 2015, Burke was named deputy spokesman under the Rev. Federico Lombardi, an Italian Jesuit. When Lombardi retired in 2016, Burke became main spokesman and was joined by Garcia, the first woman to ever hold the position of deputy. Garcia had been the Vatican correspondent for the Cadena Cope, the Spanish broadcaster."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Ex-Argentina FM who had role in probe of AMIA bombing dies	"Hector Timerman, a foreign minister in former President Cristina Fernandez's government who played a key role in the disputed investigation into the deadly 1994 bombing of the AMIA Jewish center, has died, his family said Sunday. He was 65. Timerman's brother, Javier, confirmed his death in a tweet, writing ""I am going to miss you more than you can imagine."" He had been suffering from cancer. Hector Timerman was Argentina's top diplomat from 2010 to 2015. He was detained late last year and placed under house arrest, accused of taking part in a cover-up of Iran's role in the bombing of Jewish Center in Buenos Aires, which left 85 people dead in Argentina's worst terrorist attack. Prosecutor Alberto Nisman, whose 2015 death remains unsolved, had contended that a 2013 agreement with Iran, which was portrayed as a joint attempt to solve the case, in reality ensured that the Iranians involved would never be prosecuted. A joint ""truth commission"" called for by the deal was approved by Argentina's Congress but it was never formed because it was later ruled by local courts to be unconstitutional. Timerman, who as a signatory to the agreement, and Fernandez both denied there was a cover-up. Investigators have linked former Iranian officials to the attack, but Iran has denied any connection with the attack and declined to turn over suspects. In one of his final public appearances in July, Timerman took part in a videoconference and spoke about his health problems, saying ""the only thing that advances is my cancer."" ""Goodbye, dear friend,"" tweeted Anibal Fernandez, the former Cabinet chief under Cristina Fernandez, ""they hurt you without reason. They will pay for this."" Timerman earlier served as Argentina's ambassador to the United States."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Egypt says its security forces killed 40 militants	"Egypt said Saturday its security forces have killed 40 militants in raids on their hideouts in the Sinai Peninsula and the Greater Cairo area, just hours after a roadside bomb targeted a tourist bus in the capital, killing three Vietnamese tourists and their Egyptian guide. In a Saturday statement, the Interior Ministry, which oversees the police, said 10 of the militants were killed when the security forces stormed their hideout in el-Arish, a coastal city in the turbulent north of Sinai, epicenter of a long-running insurgency by Islamists. Another 14 were killed in the Cairo suburb of October 6 and 16 more in a housing project on a highway heading west from Cairo. The statement said the militants were preparing for attacks on government and tourism facilities, army and police personnel, as well as Christian churches. The ministry also released a series of images purportedly depicting some of the militants killed in the raids, with assault rifles seen next to their bloodied bodies. The statement did not say when the raids took place, suggesting that the timing of its release was designed at least in part to show that security forces were scoring successes against militants across the country and staunch potential criticism of their perceived failure to protect tourists. The area where the attack took place — Marioutiyah, near the famed Giza Pyramids — has seen a series of attacks over the past two years, mostly targeting the police. It is also widely suspected of being home to jihadist cells loyal to the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group removed from power by the military in 2013 after its divisive rule lasted one year. Friday night's attack took place as Egypt's vital tourism industry was showing encouraging signs of recovery after years in the doldrums because of the political turmoil and violence that followed a 2011 uprising that toppled an autocratic president. The revival of the labor-intensive sector has been warmly welcomed in a country whose economy is struggling to find its footing, with a series of ambitious reforms unleashing wave after wave of steep price rises. The attack is also likely to prompt authorities to further tighten security around tourists and the facilities they frequent — hotels, museums, antiquity sites and bazaars — during the busy holiday season. Security measures already cause long delays at the country's airports and antiquity sites. Tourist buses routinely get a police escort and Egyptians are generally subjected to even more stringent security checks at tourist facilities. There will likely be stepped up security measures for churches and associated facilities ahead of the New Year's Eve celebrations and next month's Christmas of the Coptic Orthodox Church, the dominant denomination among Egypt's estimated 10 million Christians. Egypt has battled Islamic militants for years in the Sinai Peninsula in an insurgency that has occasionally spilled over to the mainland, striking minority Christians or tourists. However, Friday's attack was the first to target foreign tourists in almost two years. Over the past two years, militant attacks against Christians in Egypt — usually targeting churches or buses carrying pilgrims to remote desert monasteries — have killed over a hundred people, prompting authorities to introduce metal detectors and body searches outside churches. In some churches, guards demand to see proof that visitors are Christians, often in the form of the cross tattooed on the right wrist that many Egyptian Christians get in their infancy. Friday's blast wounded 11 other Vietnamese tourists as well as the Egyptian driver of the bus, which was carrying a total of 15 Vietnamese tourists, according to Vietnam's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It said that 10 were seriously injured. Vietnamese Ambassador to Egypt Tran Thanh Cong visited the scene of the attack and Al Haram Hospital, where the victims were being treated, the ministry said."	nonTerrorism	Religion

"Vatican official urges Iraq's Christians to forgive, rebuild"	"The Vatican secretary of state urged Iraqi Christians who have endured years of Islamic extremist persecution to forgive, reconcile and rebuild their broken communities as he celebrated Mass Friday in Iraq's largest Christian town. Cardinal Pietro Parolin has spent the Christmas holidays in Iraq in a show of Pope Francis' solidarity with the region's Christian minorities, many of whom were forced to flee their homes during the years of extremist violence. Parolin celebrated Mass in the Altahera Syro-Catholic Cathedral in Qaraqosh, which was overtaken by the Islamic State group in 2014. In his homily, Parolin praised those who had refused to renounce their faith and instead resisted and went into exile. ""In God's saving plan, your sacrifices will not be without fruit, as fruitful as the witness of so many martyrs who, from the first centuries of Christianity, bathed this land with their blood and lived their faith heroically to the end,"" he said. He urged those families who are now returning not to dwell on revenge but to instead forgive those who wronged them, reconcile and rebuild. Many of the Christian communities of northern Iraq are some of the oldest of the faith, where dialects of Aramaic — the language of Jesus — are still spoken. ""May the pain and violence you have endured never turn into bitterness, and may the heavy yoke of hatred never fall on your shoulders,"" Parolin told the Iraqi religious leaders and faithful in the cathedral. ""Forgiveness is the basis of reconciliation."" In the two years that the Islamic State group held Qaraqosh, militants burned down its churches, destroyed its religious altars and statues, and forced residents to convert or flee. By the time Iraqi forces retook it in 2016, Qaraqosh was practically deserted. Hundreds of families have since returned, and the global Christian community has donated generously to rebuild the churches. There aren't reliable census figures to go by, but by all accounts Qaraqosh was once Iraq's largest Christian town with a population of around 50,000 inhabitants. But Iraq's Christian numbers have been dwindling since the 2003 U.S. invasion, after which Christians of northern Iraq endured attacks by fundamentalist Islamic groups — foremost among them Al-Qaida."	nonTerrorism	Religion

Bomb at Greek church injures 2 after no warning given	"A crudely-made bomb exploded outside one of Athens' most important churches early Thursday, injuring its caretaker and a police officer — troubling authorities as the attack took place without warning in one of the capital's busiest areas. Police officials said the timed device exploded outside the Orthodox church of Saint Dionysius the Areopagite in the upscale Kolonaki area of the capital before a Christmas holiday service to mark St. Stephen's day. The two victims were hospitalized. Neither of the men has injuries that are life-threatening, according to police and church officials. The blast caused minimal damage. Father Symeon Voliotis, an aide at the archbishop's office, said the caretaker found the explosive device at the front entrance of the church, moved it to a nearby parking space, and alerted police. ""Any action that threatens life or disturbs the peace must be condemned,"" he told state-run ERT television. ""My first thought was that someone homeless may have been hurt, because they often seek shelter there. But fortunately that was not the case."" Authorities were already on alert following a Dec. 17 attack on the private Skai television station when a powerful bomb damaged the front of the building. Militant far-left and anarchist groups have carried out attacks over the Christmas holidays in recent years. Counterterrorism officers were leading the investigation into the explosion, and officers cordoned off the busy central Athens area while colleagues gathered evidence. The church is dedicated to Saint Dionysius the Areopagite, the 1st century Athens judge who converted to Christianity and became the city's patron saint. ""What made an impression on us was that the (bomb) was just left there, without warning,"" said Father Giorgios, who holds services at the church. ""The service was due to start as 7:30 but quite often, people go earlier to light a candle."" ""This church has three priests and we are all wondering why someone would attack the patron saint of Athens ... We don't really understand why someone would attack us, to attack love.""

"Small bombs hit popular southern Thai beach, damaging statue"	" Two small bombs exploded at a popular beach in southern Thailand, one of them damaging an iconic statue beloved by tourists, police said. Police in Songkhla province said they're looking into whether the bombs late Wednesday were related to a Muslim separatist insurgency that has wracked nearby provinces since 2004, taking almost 7,000 lives. One of the explosions damaged the Golden Mermaid statue, which is an unofficial symbol of the province, said police Lt. Gen. Ronnasilp Phusara. The other took place about 300 meters (yards) away, near the beach's Cat and Mouse sculpture. Police said a bomb disposal squad discovered and destroyed three other explosive devices found near a trash area and under rocks near the Golden Mermaid statue. The insurgency has mostly affected the three southernmost provinces of Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat, which have Muslim majorities in predominantly Buddhist Thailand. Songkhla, with a substantial Muslim population, has generally been spared the violence, though its biggest city, Hat Yai, has suffered several bombings. Although terrorism is not considered a major problem in Thailand, tourist spots have been sporadically targeted since 2006, when a series of bombs were set off in Bangkok at New Year's Eve gatherings, killing three people and wounding more than three dozen. In 2016, bomb explosions in five beach towns popular with tourists killed four people and wounded dozens. In both cases, southern separatists were suspected but responsibility was never definitively established. Thailand's most spectacular attack in recent years occurred at the Erawan Shrine in the center of Bangkok's tourist district in August 2015. Twenty people, mostly foreign tourists, were killed and more than 100 hurt. Thai authorities blamed human traffickers angry at a crackdown, but another theory holds that it was carried out by militants from China's Muslim Uighur minority in retaliation for Thailand sending back to China a group of Uighurs who had fled repression there. Two Uighur men are currently on trial for the bombing."	nonTerrorism	Religion
 Pope's initial blind spot on sex abuse threatens legacy	" It has been a wretched year for Pope Francis, whose blind spot on clergy sex abuse conspired with events beyond his control to threaten his legacy and throw the Catholic hierarchy into a credibility crisis not seen in modern times. The latest development — a high-profile verdict in a far-away country — cements the impression that Francis simply didn't ""get it"" when he first became pope in 2013 and began leading the church. Early missteps included associating with compromised cardinals and bishops and downplaying or dismissing rumors of abuse and cover-up. Francis finally came around in 2018, when he publicly admitted he was wrong about a case in Chile, made amends, and laid the groundwork for the future by calling an abuse prevention summit next year. But damage to his moral authority on the issue has been done. Before his eyes were opened, Francis showed that he was a product of the very clerical culture he so often denounces, ever ready to take the word of the clerical class over victims. The year started off well enough: Francis dedicated his annual Jan. 1 peace message to the plight of migrants and refugees. Soon thereafter, he baptized 34 cooing babies in the Sistine Chapel and urged their mothers to nurse, a typical Franciscan show of informal practicality amid the splendor of Michelangelo's ""Last Judgment."" Francis' January visit was dominated by the clergy abuse scandal there, and featured unprecedented protests against a papal visit: churches were firebombed and riot police used water cannons to quell demonstrations. Chilean opposition to Francis had actually begun three years prior, when the Argentine-born pope appointed Juan Barros as bishop of the southern diocese of Osorno. Francis had dismissed allegations that Barros ignored and covered up abuse by Chile's most prominent predator priest, imposing him on a diocese that wanted nothing to do with him. ""The day they bring me proof against Bishop Barros, I'll speak,"" Francis said on his final day in Chile. ""There is not one shed of proof against him. It's all slander. Is that clear?"" Francis defended Barros because one of his friends and advisers, Chilean Cardinal Javier Errazuriz, defended Barros. Francis in 2013 had named Errazuriz to his inner circle, a formal parallel cabinet of nine cardinals who meet every three months at the Vatican. Chilean victims, though, had long charged that Errazuriz had been deaf to their claims while he was archbishop of Santiago, giving cover to abusers and their enablers. Francis disregarded the victims' concerns and appointed Errazuriz to the high-profile cabinet post. In the wake of his disastrous trip to Chile, Francis slowly came around to the victims' view, in part in response to reporting by The Associated Press. He ordered an in-depth investigation into the Chilean church, admitted to ""grave errors in judgment"" and personally apologized to the victims he had discredited. He accused the Chilean leadership of creating a ""culture of cover-up"" and secured the resignations of every active bishop there, Barros included. He vowed that the Catholic Church would ""never again"" hide abuse, and earlier this month the Vatican announced Francis had fired Errazuriz from the cabinet. Also removed was Cardinal George Pell, who left his post as the Vatican's economy minister in June 2017 to stand trial for historical sex abuse offenses in his native Australia. Like Errazuriz, Pell had been the target of abuse victims' ire for years, well before Francis brought him to the Vatican, given his prominent role in Australia and the church's horrific record with abuse there. Both men deny wrongdoing. But their continued presence on the Council of Nine, as the cabinet is called, became a source of scandal for the pope, who bid them farewell in October with a letter thanking them for their service. For Pell, the C9 removal suggests he won't resume work at the Vatican since his five-year term expires early next year. They are not the only cardinals on the hot seat: The current archbishop of Santiago is under investigation in a broad criminal inquiry into sex abuse cover-up. Prosecutors in a dozen U.S. states are investigating church files. A cover-up trial in France has two cardinals as defendants, including the Spaniard who heads the Vatican office that processes sex abuse cases. The Holy See invoked sovereign immunity to spare Spain's Cardinal Luis Ladaria Ferrer. But it has no such power to protect Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, the archbishop of Lyon, France, who is accused of failing to report a self-confessed abusive priest to authorities. Francis has said French justice should take its course but has praised Barbarin as ""brave."" Despite such problems, with the Chile scandal largely atoned for and decisions made to purge his inner circle of compromised members, Francis appeared by summer to be well on his way to steering himself out of the 2018 sex abuse crisis. In July, Francis removed U.S. Archbishop Theodore McCarrick as a cardinal after church investigators said an allegation that he groped a teenage altar boy in the 1970s was credible. Subsequently, several former seminarians and priests reported that they too had been abused or harassed by McCarrick as adults. A month later, a grand jury report in Pennsylvania revealed seven decades of abuse and cover-up in six dioceses, with allegations that more than 1,000 children had been molested by about 300 priests. Most of the priests were dead, and the crimes far pre-dated Francis' papacy. But the combined scandal created a crisis in confidence in the U.S. and Vatican hierarchy. It was apparently common knowledge in the U.S. and Vatican leadership that ""Uncle Ted,"" as McCarrick was known, slept with seminarians, and yet he still he rose undisturbed up the church ranks. Having removed McCarrick and approved a canonical trial against him, Francis should have emerged as the hero in the saga since he righted the wrong of St. John Paul II, the pope from 1978-2005 who had promoted McCarrick to begin with and whose record on abuse issues is far worse than Francis' given his inaction. But Francis' get-tough victory lap was cut short when a former Vatican ambassador to the U.S. accused the pope himself of participating in the McCarrick cover-up. In an 11-page denunciation in August, Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano claimed that Vatican officials from the top on down over the course of three pontificates had known about McCarrick's penchant for seminarians, and turned a blind eye. Vigano wrote that he had told Francis in 2013, at the start of his pontificate, that McCarrick had ""corrupted a generation"" of seminarians and priests and that Pope Benedict XVI had eventually sanctioned him for his sexual misconduct. Vigano claimed Francis disregarded his 2013 warning and rehabilited McCarrick from those sanctions, making him a key adviser and entrusting him with delicate missions to China and elsewhere. Francis never responded to Vigano's laundry list of claims. Instead, Francis took to blaming the devil — ""the Great Accuser"" — for sowing division and discord in the church, an indirect jab at Vigano that only fueled conservative outrage at Francis and demands that he come clean about what he knew about McCarrick and when. The Vatican didn't help Francis' standing any when, without providing any plausible reason, it blocked U.S. bishops from adopting accountability measures to try to restore trust with their flocks. It now seems clear that Francis, at least at the start of his pontificate, was willing to overlook past sexual misbehavior or cover-up claims if those responsible had atoned. Francis launched his pontificate with his famous ""Who am I to judge"" comment, about a gay priest whom he had appointed to a top advisory position despite allegations he had had a string of lovers. That comment, which won him plaudits from liberal Catholics and landed him on the cover of Advocate magazine, may now be his undoing. If he had judged his advisers more scrupulously at the start of his pontificate on their abuse and cover-up records, he might have retained more credibility in 2018."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Egypt 's 2 ex-presidents appear in the same courtroom	"Two former Egyptian presidents appeared Wednesday in the same Cairo courtroom, with Hosni Mubarak testifying in a retrial of Mohammed Morsi over charges related to prison breaks at the height of the 2011 uprising that toppled Mubarak. The 90-year-old Mubarak, whose nearly three-decade rule was ended by a popular uprising in 2011, could be seen walking into the courtroom with a cane along with his two sons Alaa and Gamal. He was wearing a dark blue suit with a dark tie. The hearing took place amid heavy security in a police facility in a southern Cairo suburb. Morsi, 67, and the Muslim Brotherhood swiftly rose to power in elections after Mubarak's ouster, only to find themselves imprisoned a year later when millions protested against them for abuse of power, leading the military to overthrow the government. The jailed former leader is implicated in four lengthy trials pertaining to different cases against him, that vary from undermining national security by conspiring with foreign groups and orchestrating a prison break. Wednesday's case is rooted in the 2011 escape of more than 20,000 inmates from Egyptian prisons -- including Morsi and other Muslim Brotherhood members -- during the early days of the 18-day uprising against Mubarak. Morsi and the other Brotherhood leaders escaped two days after they were detained as Mubarak's security forces tried to undercut the planned protests. At the time, authorities also cut off internet access and mobile phone networks, crippling communication among the protesters and with the outside world. In June 2015, the Cairo Criminal Court issued sentences of death and life imprisonment against Morsi and other key figures of the Brotherhood. However, in November 2016, the Court of Cassation, Egypt's final recourse for appeals in criminal cases, annulled the sentence and ordered a retrial of the defendants. In a two-hour testimony, Mubarak said Wednesday that former spy chief and vice president Omar Suleiman told him on Jan. 29, 2011, that at least 800 armed people crossed into the norther part of Sinai Peninsula, through tunnels from the Gaza strip with help from the Muslim Brotherhood group. ""They entered Egypt through Gaza and had weapons. ... They headed toward the prisons to release prisoners belonging to Hezbollah, Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood,"" Mubarak said, referring to Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group and Hamas militants who have ruled Gaza since 2007. Mubarak refused to answer most questions, saying he needs permission from the military and President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who led the military's 2013 ouster of Morsi, Egypt's first freely elected president. El-Sissi has since overseen a massive crackdown on Morsi's supporters, jailing thousands of them along with secular activists behind the 2011 uprising. Mubarak was freed last year, ending nearly six year of legal proceedings against him. He was acquitted by the country's top appeals court of charges that he ordered the killing of protesters during the 2011 uprising. Mubarak has already served a three-year sentence for embezzling state funds while in detention in connection with the protesters' case. Morsi, who was in white jumpsuits, refused to question Mubarak.

Persecution against Christians to be subject of British government review	"With violence against the world’s Christians reportedly on the rise, Britain’s government announced Wednesday that it has commissioned an independent review into the persecution. The goal of the British plan is to develop practical steps for supporting Christians around the globe, particularly women and children, who are often subjected to sexual violence, Reuters reported. Some 215 million Christians worldwide faced persecution last year, a British statement said, with about 250 Christians killed every month. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “So often the persecution of Christians is a telling early warning sign of the persecution of every minority,” British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said in the statement. “Today I have asked the Bishop of Truro to look at how the British government can better respond to the plight of persecuted Christians around the world. We can and must do more.” THIS CHRISTMAS, DON'T FORGET TO PRAY AND TAKE ACTION FOR THE PERSECUTED CHRISTIANS AROUND THE WORLD Britain’s review will examine Christian persecution in the Middle East, Africa and Asia, analyze British support and recommend a comprehensive policy response, the government said."	nonTerrorism	Religion
 Iraq officially declares Christmas Day a national holiday	" Iraq's Cabinet formally declared Christmas to be a national holiday as the country's Christians celebrated the birth of Jesus amid tight security more than a year after Baghdad declared victory over ISIS who sought to eradicate all who did not follow the group's strict interpretation of Sunni Islam. ""We extend our warmest wishes to Christians in Iraq and around the world for a very happy and peaceful Christmas,"" the government said in a Tuesday morning tweet. According to Reuters, Iraq's Christian population dropped from 1.5 million to approximately 400,000 after the American invasion in 2003 and that number has likely fallen further after ISIS swept across the north of the country in 2014. Iraq declared victory over ISIS last year, but the effects of the fighting are still visible. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In Baghdad, more than one hundred congregants attended Christmas mass at St. George Chaldean Church, led by Father Basilius. ""Of course we can say the security situation is better than in previous years,"" he told Reuters. ""We enjoy security and stability mainly in Baghdad. In addition, Daesh [the Arabic acronym for ISIS] was beaten."" In an acknowledgment of the improved security situation, Pope Francis has dispatched his trusted secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, to Iraq to celebrate the Christmas season. Parolin met Monday in Baghdad with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi and celebrated a Christmas Vigil Mass at the Chaldean Cathedral of Saint Joseph in Baghdad's Karrada district, which has a significant Christian community. He is scheduled in the coming days to travel to northern Iraq to meet with Kurdish leaders in Irbil and to celebrate Mass in Qaraqosh in the Nineveh plains, near Mosul, according to the Vatican. Christian communities have existed in Iraq since the first century and the Vatican has urged Christians who have fled persecution in Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere in the Middle East to return to their homes when security conditions permit.

Queen Elizabeth II celebrates Christmas before annual speech	"Queen Elizabeth II was cheered by onlookers when she and other senior royals arrived at a Christmas church service on the grounds of one of her country estates. The 92-year-old queen arrived by car Tuesday morning while younger royals walked from her grand country house in Sandringham to nearby St. Mary Magdalene Church. Prince Charles led the way, followed by his sons: Prince William and his wife Catherine and Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, who is expecting their first child in the spring. Harry and Meghan walked arm in arm next to William and Catherine. Many in the crowd wished the young royals a ""Merry Christmas"" as they strolled to the church on a cold wintry day in the English countryside. Later they received flowers from the crowd after the 45-minute service as they headed back to Sandringham House ahead of a traditional Christmas lunch. The queen's husband, Prince Philip, who is 97 and largely retired from public life, did not attend the church service. Charles' wife Camilla, who is recovering from flu, also skipped the service. Many other members of the royal family were also in attendance. Prince Andrew, the queen's son, arrived by car with his mother. Princess Eugenie, one of the queen's grandchildren, arrived with her new husband Jack Brooksbank. Britain's royals usually exchange small gifts on Christmas Eve, a practice popularized by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. The queen typically frowns on extravagant gifts and many of the presents are novelty items. When the queen was younger, there would typically be a brisk family walk through the woods on Christmas or an excursion on horseback. The queen's pre-recorded annual message to Britain and the 52 other Commonwealth nations will be televised in the afternoon. Elizabeth made her first Christmas Day broadcast on the radio in 1952, the year she ascended to the throne."	nonTerrorism	Religion
Defense Secretary James Mattis' resignation letter	"President Trump on Thursday announced that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be retiring in February. Read Mattis' full resignation letter here: I have been privileged to serve as our country's 26th Secretary of Defense which has allowed me to serve alongside our men and women of the Department in defense of our citizens and our ideals. I am proud of the progress that has been made over the past two years on some of the key goals articulated in our National Defense Strategy: putting the Department on a more sound budgetary footing, improving readiness and lethality in our forces, and reforming the Department's business practices for greater performance. Our troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in conflict and sustain strong U.S. global influence. One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies. Like you, I have said from the beginning that the armed forces of the United States should not be the policeman of the world. Instead, we must use all tools of American power to provide for the common defense, including providing effective leadership to our alliances. NATO's 29 democracies demonstrated that strength in their commitment to fighting alongside us following the 9-11 attack on America. The Defeat-ISIS coalition of 74 nations is further proof. Similarly, I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours. It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model - gaining veto authority over other nations' economic, diplomatic, and security decisions - to promote their own interests at the expense of their neighbors, America and our allies. That is why we must use all the tools of American power to provide for the common defense. My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances. Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position. The end date for my tenure is February 28, 2019, a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed as well as to make sure the Department's interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February. Further, that a full transition to a new Secretary of Defense occurs well in advance of the transition of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September in order to ensure stability within the Department. I pledge my full effort to a smooth transition that ensures the needs and interests of the 2.15 million Service Members and 732,079 DoD civilians receive undistracted attention of the Department at all times so that they can fulfill their critical, round-the-clock mission to protect the American people. I very much appreciate this opportunity to serve the nation and our men and women in uniform."	nonTerrorism	Politics
"Defense Secretary James Mattis signs Syria withdrawal orders, official says"	"Outgoing Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has signed orders to pull all American troops out of Syria in the coming weeks, a senior defense official told Fox News on Sunday. Pentagon officials refused to discuss specifics including the timeline citing operational security for the roughly 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria. Plans were set in motion hours after President Trump declared the Islamic State terror network “defeated” in Syria in a tweet Wednesday and ordered all American diplomats and soldiers out of the country. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP. Trump pledged in campaign rallies last spring U.S. troops would be leaving Syria “very soon.” While the U.S. military is planning to leave Syria, it has no plans to withdraw the more than 5,000 American troops in neighboring Iraq. Some of those special operations forces could be used for raids against “high value targets” in Syria from bases in Iraq if necessary, officials said. The last ISIS stronghold in eastern Syria is the city of Hajin located not far from the Iraqi border. U.S. and allied artillery continue to fire on ISIS positions from Iraq. U.S.-led coalition air strikes also continue against the terrorist army in Syria. But questions remain about what will happen once all American forces are out of Syria. “Challenges are ahead,” one U.S. official said. Currently, no Kurdish or Arab fighters in the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have the ability to call in American airstrikes. It’s not clear whether the SDF will continue to receive arms and funding from the United States to sustain the fight against ISIS. Trump said in a tweet Sunday the U.S. withdrawal from Syria would be “slow & highly coordinated,” after speaking to his Turkish counterpart, his second call with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan since Dec. 14. Fox News first reported it was Erdogan who convinced Trump to pull out of Syria. Turkey’s president has called the Kurdish-dominated SDF a terrorist organization over its links to a Kurdish separatist group in Turkey which has killed thousands in recent decades. In a separate tweet Sunday, President Trump said Mattis would be leaving by Jan. 1, forcing him out two months earlier than expected. American military leaders have said the SDF is the best allied force on the ground in Syria to crush ISIS. Today, ISIS only controls one percent of the area it once held across Syria and Iraq — an area at its peak the size of Ohio — due in part to the U.S. military's alliance with the SDF in Syria. Critics of the president’s decision to pull out of Syria said ISIS has not been defeated yet -- and lawmakers have urged Trump not to repeat the mistakes attributed to former President Obama when all U.S. troops were pulled out of Iraq in 2011, helping give rise to ISIS. TRUMP LAMENTS MEDIA FOCUS ON PULLOUTS FROM 'NEVER ENDING WARS' IN SYRIA, AFGHANISTAN Some officials have said the hundreds of American special operations forces in Syria had run out of targets and could be put back in if necessary. Others have said it would be a betrayal to the Kurdish and Arab fighters loyal to the U.S. military to leave Syria now. Hundreds of Kurdish fighters of the SDF have been killed fighting ISIS in Syria. U.S. airstrikes began in Syria against ISIS in 2014 a year before any U.S. troops were on the ground. Trump's envoy to the ISIS coalition, Brett McGurk, resigned Friday just one day after Mattis announced his retirement. French and British special operations forces will remain in Syria, according to both countries defense ministries.  Air strikes from those nations are set to continue."	nonTerrorism	Politics
 Trump bashes Corker's poll numbers after GOP critic calls gov't shutdown 'made-up fight'	"Sen. Bob Corker took a shot at President Trump on Sunday amid the ongoing partial government shutdown, accusing the president of being involved in a “made-up fight” and telling Americans to focus on a “significant thing like pulling out of Syria” -- sparking a war of words between the two Republicans. Corker, R-Tenn., the retiring junior lawmaker from Tennessee, has stepped up his criticism of Trump since announcing he would not run for a third term and -- in the final weeks of his term -- Corker has blasted the president for both the government shutdown and for his announcement that he was pulling U.S. troops out of war-torn Syria. “This is a made up fight so the president can look like he's fighting and winning,” Corker said of the shutdown on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “This is made up fight. I would tell Americans to turn this off and focus on a significant thing like pulling out of Syria.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Corker’s comments came after a whirlwind week for Trump that seemed to foreshadow what probably will be a rocky two years ahead as the president gears up for re-election. ""This is tyranny of talk radio hosts,"" Corker said earlier in the week as he skipped a White House meeting Friday on the spending impasse. ""You have two talk radio hosts who completely flipped a president."" In an attempt to shift blame for the shutdown, Trump has embraced the tactic employed by so many of his predecessors: positioning himself in contrast to the far-less-favorably viewed Congress. He vented publicly and privately at lawmakers for failing to get him the border wall money even as they noted he barely registered an opinion on the legislation until the eleventh hour. Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his contemplated drawdown in Afghanistan should hardly come as a surprise to Republicans who saw him promise those moves during the campaign. Still, that doesn't lessen the sting. Trump's isolationist foreign policy broke with decades of mainstream GOP thinking, and the departure of Defense Secretary James Mattis and a U.S. envoy to the global coalition fighting the Islamic State proved that Trump's instincts are now the guiding ideology of his administration. “I think the president has felt ‘I got this now. I got this under control,” Corker said Sunday. “I think we’re in a whole different period now.” He added: “I don’t know what to say. I’ve done as much as I can as senator. I've pointed out problems…somehow or another I hope the president will make decisions that are not ultimately devastating.” There has been speculation that Corker might mount a presidential campaign to unseat Trump in a Republican primary in 2020, but the outgoing senator has so far played his cards close to the chest. TRUMP LAMENTS MEDIA FOCUS ON PULLOUTS FROM 'NEVER ENDING WARS' ""The Republican Party has been a party of fiscal conservatism and a party of free trade and a party of leadership around the world. We're in a little different place right now,"" Corker said. ""But as to whether having a primary for the sake of touting those principles makes any sense, I don't know. I think that probably if somebody were to run, then they probably ought to run because they think they can win and want to be president. But don't put me in that category yet."" During his 12 years on Capitol Hill, Corker played notable roles during the financial and auto industry bailouts, and in 2015 became chairman of the powerful foreign relations committee. But his final act was shaped by run-ins with Trump. Their feud broiled after the president said both sides were to blame for deadly violence surrounding a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017. Corker said Trump's comments showed he had not yet been ""able to demonstrate the stability, nor some of the competence, that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful."" GOFUNDME ACCOUNT LOOKS TO BUY 'LADDERS' FOR SCALING TRUMP'S BORDER WALL After Corker announced he wouldn't run again, in October 2017 he charged that Trump turned the White House into an ""adult day care center"" and was setting the U.S. ""on the path to World War III."" He's since been a foil to Trump on a range of topics: his tariffs, his response to the death of writer and activist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, his recent decision to withdraw troops from Syria, and more. Trump was quick to respond to Corker's comments on Sunday - calling the senator out on social media for poor polling numbers after the president failed to endorse him. Corker has denied this and has claimed Trump actually had called him to ask the Tennessee lawmaker to run again. ""Bob Corker was responsible for giving us the horrible Iran Nuclear Deal, which I ended, yet he badmouths me for wanting to bring our young people safely back home,"" Trump tweeted. ""Bob wanted to run and asked for my endorsement. I said NO and the game was over. #MAGA I LOVE TENNESSEE!"" Corker quickly responded by mocking Trump's claim that Mexico will pay for the border wall. A Middle Tennessee State University poll of state voters found Corker's approval rating sank last year amid a feud with Trump over the president's fitness to handle international affairs.

 Treasury chief Mnuchin talks to bank CEOs amid Wall Street jitters	"U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called the CEOs of six major banks Sunday in an apparent attempt to reassure jittery financial markets coming off a turbulent week in the stock market that is now bracing for potential repercussions from a partial shutdown of the U.S. government. In an unusual move, Mnuchin disclosed the calls with the heads of Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo in a tweet about the private conversations. Mnuchin said the CEOs all assured him they have ample money to finance all their normal operations, even though there haven't been any serious liquidity concerns rattling the market. Worries about slowing economic growth and rising interest rates saddled the U.S. market with its worst week in more than seven years. Barring a turnaround, stocks are now headed for their single worst month since October 2008, when the market was being battered by the global financial crisis. That crisis was triggered by a reckless lending spree that prompted a taxpayer-backed bailout of several U.S. banks. But the circumstances are dramatically different now that the U.S. economy has been growing steadily since 2009. Most experts believe the growth will continue in the U.S., but there are signs things are slowing down in Europe and China. Dysfunction in Washington isn't helping the situation, with a budget impasse between President Donald Trump and Congress triggering a partial U.S. government shutdown that could last into the new year."	nonTerrorism	Politics

Who is Patrick Shanahan? A look at Trump’s new acting secretary of defense	"President Trump on Sunday said deputy defense secretary Patrick Shanahan will take over as acting secretary of the department on Jan. 1 to cover the accelerated departure of Jim Mattis — after a string of disagreements between Trump and Mattis. “I am pleased to announce that our very talented Deputy Secretary of Defense, Patrick Shanahan, will assume the title of Acting Secretary of Defense starting January 1, 2019,” Trump wrote on Twitter Sunday morning. ”Patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as Deputy, & previously Boeing. He will be great!” Read on for a look at five things you should know about Shanahan. Lt. Col. Joseph Buccino, a spokesman for Shanahan, said the former Boeing Co. executive will accept the appointment as acting secretary. “Deputy Secretary will continue to serve as directed by the president, and the Department of Defense will remain focused on the defense of the nation,” Buccino said on Sunday. It is unusual for the Pentagon to have an acting secretary of defense. Historically when a secretary has resigned, he has stayed on until a successor is confirmed. For example, when Obama-era Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced his resignation in November 2014, he stayed in office until Ash Carter was confirmed the following February. Shanahan, a former Boeing Co. executive, was nominated for the job of deputy defense secretary in early 2017. He'd moved up through the management ranks at Boeing over a career that began in 1986. The Puget Sound Business Journal called him a Boeing “fix-it” man in a March 2016 report. He oversaw the company’s global supply-chain strategies and use of advanced manufacturing technologies. Shanahan was central to getting the 787 Dreamliner on track after production problems in the program’s early years, the report said. The pedigreed engineer, according to his bio, has two advanced degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology: a Master of Science degree in mechanical engineering, and an MBA from MIT’s Sloan School of Management. Shanahan is the son of Vietnam veteran Mike Shanahan, who served in the U.S. Army. “He returned home and continued his selfless service to his fellow Americans with another 25 years in law enforcement,” Shanahan said, according to an October 2017 article on the Department of Defense’s website. “Growing up, my understanding of the war came from my Dad, his friends and the few stories they would share.” The Washington state native also said during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee that his veteran father raised him and his younger brothers with the American ideology of “service before self.” Before Shanahan was confirmed by the Senate in a 92-7 vote, the late Arizona Sen. John McCain said he wasn’t overjoyed that a defense industry executive with no prior military experience would come to lead the Pentagon. The Hill reported that Shanahan wasn’t close with Mattis; however he is liked by the White House. “He’s not a policy or geopolitics guy. He’s a business guy,” a source told Defense News. “But he’s spent the last year learning from the best. And Shanahan is known for having a good relationship” with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. The Hill reported that Shanahan frequently visited Trump and Pence as project leader within the Pentagon of the proposed Space Force military service. “Too often we focus on process, or budget, or level of effort,” Shanahan told Defense News. “The Pentagon should focus on outcomes and outputs — our performance. This focus on performance should drive us to field unmatched lethality, execute on our modernization plans and achieve this affordably.” “It’s all about the system and then the reinforcing mechanisms to make that change enduring. Without a system, things fall apart when the leader moves on,” Shanahan continued. “The system or the environment shouldn’t be dependent on the leader’s presence.” “It’s very easy in a complex environment like this to get distracted. The tactical can consume an enormous amount of time,” he added. “But my job is really to drive change at scale and there’s a formula for doing that. And the formula really has to do with change [which] must be systemic.” Fox News’ Lucas Tomlinson and The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Politics
Defense Secretary James Mattis to leave as of January 1; Trump taps Patrick Shanahan as acting secretary of defense	"President Trump announced Sunday that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be leaving the administration on January 1, weeks earlier than planned and just days after Mattis' bombshell resignation letter made clear his policy disagreements with the White House. ""I am pleased to announce that our very talented Deputy Secretary of Defense, Patrick Shanahan, will assume the title of Acting Secretary of Defense starting January 1, 2019,"" Trump wrote on Twitter Sunday morning. ""Patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as Deputy, & previously Boeing. He will be great!"" Shanahan is a former Boeing executive who joined the Pentagon in July 2017. In his resignation letter Thursday, Mattis, 68, had said he would remain in his role for more than three months. Also on Thursday, Trump had said Mattis -- the first Cabinet official in 40 years to resign over a stated policy difference with the president -- was leaving in February. BEHIND THE SCENES OF THE MATTIS RESIGNATION ""The end date for my tenure is February 28, 2019, a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed as well as to make sure the Department's interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February,"" Mattis wrote Thursday. It was not immediately clear why Mattis' departure date was apparently moved up, but tension in the Defense Department and Washington generally has skyrocketed in the days since he suddenly announced his resignation. Sources told Fox News this week that Mattis had quit ""in protest"" over the president's national security policies and that more resignations could be coming. (In 2013, then-President Obama removed Mattis from his post running U.S. military's Central Command, reportedly without calling to notify him of the decision.) U.S. officials said this week that the Trump administration is making plans to pull all 2,000 troops out of Syria, and Trump later tweeted that “we have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.” Trump has stood by his Syria decision despite fierce blowback, telling detractors that the pullout should come as “no surprise” given his 2016 campaign promises and arguing that America’s role as “Policeman of the Middle East” is not worth the sacrifice. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Ground troops moved into Syria in 2015 to combat ISIS in the region, amid an escalating Syrian civil war. Trump had talked about pulling out of Syria before, but military leaders had warned about ISIS re-emerging should the U.S. do so. There is also concern about abandoning the U.S.' Kurdish allies. The news that Mattis will be leaving sooner than expected comes just days after Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the global coalition to defeat Islamic State (ISIS), on Saturday accelerated his planned departure and announced his resignation. The Associated Press reported that McGurk said in a resignation letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that ISIS was on the run, but wasn’t yet defeated and that U.S. work in Syria wasn’t yet done. Fox News has confirmed that McGurk submitted his resignation letter on Friday, a day after Mattis resigned. His resignation is effective December 31. The president downplayed the news via Twitter Saturday evening, saying he had neither met McGurk nor appointed him. ""Brett McGurk, who I do not know, was appointed by President Obama in 2015. Was supposed to leave in February but he just resigned prior to leaving,"" Trump tweeted. ""Grandstander? The Fake News is making such a big deal about this nothing event!"" ""If anybody but your favorite President, Donald J. Trump, announced that, after decimating ISIS in Syria, we were going to bring our troops back home (happy & healthy), that person would be the most popular hero in America,"" he continued in a follow-up tweet. ""With me, hit hard instead by the Fake News Media. Crazy!"" Meanwhile, the White House's plan to withdraw half its troops in Afghanistan by the summer -- some 7,000 soldiers -- has drawn similar criticism. While President Obama repeatedly promised to pull all troops out of Afghanistan by 2014, U.S. and NATO forces remain there in a predominately training and advising role. Afghanistan's security forces rely heavily on U.S. airpower against both Taliban and an upstart Islamic State affiliate. More than 2,400 American soldiers have died in Afghanistan since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion, and Trump announced in a video last week that troop deaths were on his mind in announcing the pullouts.

GoFundMe account looks to buy 'ladders' to scale Trump's border wall	"The battle over border wall funding just went viral as one GoFundMe account is trying to raise money for President Trump’s controversial barrier, while another is looking for funds for ladders to scale the wall. Last week, conservative activist Brian Kolfage set up a GoFundMe campaign to raise private funds to pay for Trump’s border wall. To date the campaign has raised a little over $16 million toward its goal of $1 billion – a far cry from the $21.7 billion that the Department of Homeland Security says is needed to build a wall along the entire southern border. Still, that $16 million was enough to spur liberal activist Charlotte Clymer to start a GoFundMe campaign to buy ladders to climb the wall. The newly created campaign is a bit tongue-in-cheek and even the fund’s founders admit they probably won't reach their $100 million goal (the fund currently has only raised around $135,000), but whatever amount is eventually raised will be donated to the Texas-based Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “We wanna make sure ladders are ready to send over to our undocumented friends and help them,” the GoFundMe page stated. “You see, they’ll never reach their goal, but no matter how much we raise, we’re going to reach ours.” Speaking to Business Insider, Clymer said the campaign is meant to draw attention to the benefits of immigration to the U.S. ""I've really been happy with how this has generated conversation on just the absurdity of the wall in general,"" she told Business Insider. ""Undocumented folks are not bringing crime or drug smuggling or any of this job-stealing nonsense to our country."" TRUMP BASHES CORKER'S POLL NUMBERS AFTER GOP CRITIC CALLS OUT PRESIDENT FOR SHUTDOWN STANCE The fight over the border wall has led to the current government shutdown as lawmakers bicker over funding for Trump's signature campaign promise. Mick Mulvaney, who is taking over as acting White House chief of staff, told ""Fox News Sunday"" he's awaiting word from Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York after the White House presented a counteroffer in a dispute over funding for the wall. Mulvaney declined to outline the offer but said it was between Trump's $5.7 billion request and the $1.3 billion Democrats offered. GAETZ: TRUMP 'IN THIS FOR THE LONG HAUL' IN BORDER WALL FIGHT A stalemate over the wall led parts of the government to shut down early Saturday after funding for numerous departments and agencies expired. The shutdown was expected to last through this coming Thursday at the earliest. Both the House and Senate have adjourned until later in the week.

He vented publicly and privately at lawmakers for failing to get him the border wall money even as they noted he barely registered an opinion on the legislation until the eleventh hour. Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and his contemplated drawdown in Afghanistan should hardly come as a surprise to Republicans who saw him promise those moves during the campaign. Still, that doesn't lessen the sting. Trump's isolationist foreign policy broke with decades of mainstream GOP thinking, and the departure of Defense Secretary James Mattis and a U.S. envoy to the global coalition fighting the Islamic State proved that Trump's instincts are now the guiding ideology of his administration. “I think the president has felt ‘I got this now. I got this under control,” Corker said Sunday. “I think we’re in a whole different period now.” He added: “I don’t know what to say. I’ve done as much as I can as senator. I've pointed out problems…somehow or another I hope the president will make decisions that are not ultimately devastating.” There has been speculation that Corker might mount a presidential campaign to unseat Trump in a Republican primary in 2020, but the outgoing senator has so far played his cards close to the chest. TRUMP LAMENTS MEDIA FOCUS ON PULLOUTS FROM 'NEVER ENDING WARS' ""The Republican Party has been a party of fiscal conservatism and a party of free trade and a party of leadership around the world. We're in a little different place right now,"" Corker said. ""But as to whether having a primary for the sake of touting those principles makes any sense, I don't know. I think that probably if somebody were to run, then they probably ought to run because they think they can win and want to be president. But don't put me in that category yet."" During his 12 years on Capitol Hill, Corker played notable roles during the financial and auto industry bailouts, and in 2015 became chairman of the powerful foreign relations committee. But his final act was shaped by run-ins with Trump. Their feud broiled after the president said both sides were to blame for deadly violence surrounding a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in August 2017. Corker said Trump's comments showed he had not yet been ""able to demonstrate the stability, nor some of the competence, that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful."" GOFUNDME ACCOUNT LOOKS TO BUY 'LADDERS' FOR SCALING TRUMP'S BORDER WALL After Corker announced he wouldn't run again, in October 2017 he charged that Trump turned the White House into an ""adult day care center"" and was setting the U.S. ""on the path to World War III."" He's since been a foil to Trump on a range of topics: his tariffs, his response to the death of writer and activist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, his recent decision to withdraw troops from Syria, and more. Trump was quick to respond to Corker's comments on Sunday - calling the senator out on social media for poor polling numbers after the president failed to endorse him. Corker has denied this and has claimed Trump actually had called him to ask the Tennessee lawmaker to run again. ""Bob Corker was responsible for giving us the horrible Iran Nuclear Deal, which I ended, yet he badmouths me for wanting to bring our young people safely back home,"" Trump tweeted. ""Bob wanted to run and asked for my endorsement. I said NO and the game was over. #MAGA I LOVE TENNESSEE!"" Corker quickly responded by mocking Trump's claim that Mexico will pay for the border wall. A Middle Tennessee State University poll of state voters found Corker's approval rating sank last year amid a feud with Trump over the president's fitness to handle international affairs.

"Trump laments media focus on pullouts from 'Never Ending Wars' in Syria, Afghanistan"	"Just days after signing a sweeping criminal justice reform package and an $867 billion farm bill into law, President Trump on Sunday lamented the intense media focus on his decision to remove troops from what he called the ""Never Ending Wars"" in Syria and Afghanistan. The bipartisan criminal justice reforms and the farm bill, which secured more funding for farmers hurt by the trade war with China and called for immediate ""welfare reform,"" were largely overshadowed by the president's abrupt troop drawdown -- and Defense Secretary James Mattis' sudden resignation. The White House announced last week it aimed to pull all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria and approximately 7,000 troops from Afghanistan -- roughly half of the U.S. soldiers stationed there. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""We signed two pieces of major legislation this week, Criminal Justice Reform and the Farm Bill,"" Trump wrote. ""These are two Big Deals, but all the Fake News Media wants to talk about is “the mistake” of bringing our young people back home from the Never Ending Wars. It all began 19 years ago!"" While President Obama repeatedly promised to pull all troops out of Afghanistan by 2014, U.S. and NATO forces remain there in a predominately training and advising role. Afghanistan's security forces rely heavily on U.S. airpower against both Taliban and an upstart Islamic State affiliate. More than 2,400 American soldiers have died in Afghanistan since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion, and Trump announced in a video last week that troop deaths were on his mind in announcing the pullouts. Speaking hours earlier on ""Fox News Sunday,"" incoming Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney defended Trump's planned troop withdrawals, saying that while ""we recognize the fact that this unpopular within the beltway"" and ""we recognize this fact is unpopular within the Defense Department,"" the move ultimately has been ""very popular with ordinary American people."" Mulvaney additionally commented that Mattis was not the right man for the job. ""Let’s be honest with each other,"" Mulvaney said. ""I think the relationship between these two men [Trump and Mattis] had been fraying. I think the president no longer relied on Mattis to be able to deliver the president’s vision."" WHITE HOUSE SIGNALS GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN WILL LAST WELL INTO THE NEW YEAR But Leon Panetta, who previously served as CIA Director, Secretary of Defense, White House Chief of Staff and OMB Director, later told Wallace on ""Fox News Sunday"" that the administration's move to withdraw from Syria -- apparently over Mattis' repeated and strenuous objections -- was irresponsible. ""I think the step to suddenly withdraw those troops from Syria has sent a terrible message to the world about where the United States stands,"" Panetta said. He added: ""If we’re sending a message to ISIS that somehow they can come back, they can be resilient, they can, at some point come back and attack us and have us vulnerable to another 9/11 attack -- that’s unacceptable."" Trump on Sunday also slammed outgoing Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., who has condemned Trump's pullouts as a hasty mistake that would allow ISIS to return from the brink. Corker argued that Trump's move was a worse decision than President Obama's pullout from Iraq, which analysts have said contributed to the rise of ISIS there. Speaking on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday, Corker additionally derided the ongoing partial government shutdown amid White House demands for more border wall funding as a ""purposefully contrived"" dispute and a ""made-up fight so the president can look like he is fighting."" Trump tweeted in part: ""Bob Corker was responsible for giving us the horrible Iran Nuclear Deal, which I ended, yet he badmouths me for wanting to bring our young people safely back home. Bob wanted to run and asked for my endorsement. I said NO and the game was over. #MAGA I LOVE TENNESSEE!"""	nonTerrorism	Politics
Cliven Bundy's lawyer asks federal prosecutors to forgo appeal in Nevada standoff case	"The lawyer for rancher Cliven Bundy sent a letter to the solicitor general urging him to forgo an appeal of U.S. District Court Judge Gloria Navarro’s Jan. 8 decision to dismiss all charges relating to a 2014 standoff with federal agents. “It’s ridiculous. It’s persecution,” Larry Klayman, Bundy’s lawyer and the founder of Freedom Watch and Judicial Watch, said in his letter, according to the Washington Times. He added: “After all they have gone through, including unlawful imprisonment for two years, it’s time to allow my clients to go on with their lives and not continue to be persecuted by a Department of ‘Injustice,’ which rather than meting out justice, ‘circles the wagons’ to try to unethically and unlawfully protect its own.” While a spokesperson with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Nevada confirmed that a protective notice to preserve the government’s right to appeal was filed earlier this year, it is currently unknown whether or not the appeal would be filed. A federal judge last December declared a mistrial in Bundy’s case, blaming prosecutors for withholding key evidence from defense lawyers, including records about the conduct of FBI and Bureau of Land Management agents. The Nevada rancher was accused of leading an armed standoff against the government in 2014. Jurors had previously acquitted the two Bundy sons of taking over a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon for more than a month in early 2016 and amid calls for the U.S. government to turn over public land to local control. In the Nevada case, Navarro faulted federal prosecutors for failing to turn over all evidence to defense attorneys. ""The government is obligated to disclose all evidence that might be favorable"" to the defense, the judge said. The case stemmed from an armed confrontation in Bunkerville, Nevada, that capped a decades long dispute over Cliven Bundy's refusal to pay grazing fees. The 71-year-old rancher says his family has grazed cattle for more than a century in the area and insists public land belongs to states, not the U.S. government. Government agents began rounding up his cattle. The four on trial were accused of enlisting armed gunmen to force government agents to abandon the effort."	nonTerrorism	Politics
Kasich 'actively thinking about' challenging Trump in 2020 primary	"Calling the current political climate ""disturbing,"" outgoing Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich told ""Fox News Sunday"" that he is ""actively considering"" mounting a primary challenge to President Trump in the 2020 election. Kasich -- who suspended his 2016 presidential bid in May of that year, and only claimed a win in his home state of Ohio after consistently lagging far behind Trump in all major polls -- said he has a slew of advisers analyzing his prospective candidacy every day. ""All options are on the table,"" Kasich said, including running as an Independent if he cannot secure the Republican Party nomination. ""We look every day --  I have a team of people who look every day at the factors that go into a consideration like that. We assess it, and at some point I will make a decision."" Kasich said Republicans performed well in Ohio during the 2018 midterm elections and got ""smashed"" elsewhere because the GOP in Ohio used a different ""road map"" -- one focused on ""hopefulness."" Republicans last month secured a veto-proof majority in the Ohio State Legislature, and won not only the gubernatorial contest but all four down-ticket races. Trump won Ohio by nearly 10 points in the 2016 presidential race, and several political analysts now say the state -- owing in part to changing demographics -- is no longer the swing state it historically has been. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""You can't ignore your allies. You can't just do things on your own -- 'America First,'"" Kasich said, referring to the president's campaign slogan and stated principle of governance. Primary challenges can severely damage sitting presidents, even though primary challengers themselves have not won the presidency in the modern era. Pat Buchanan's 1992 race against President George H.W. Bush for the Republican nomination demonstrated the influence of the party's hard-right wing, and Ted Kennedy's 1980 bid against President Jimmy Carter deeply divided Democrats just as Republicans united behind then-nominee Ronald Reagan. Kasich specifically suggested Trump had erred by not pushing a prospective deal this summer to provide border wall funding in exchange for a pathway to citizenship for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients. ""A president can't just get everything they want,"" Kasich said. ""I dont understand why he didn't make the deal. Give me a couple billion for the wall and in exchange for that we let the DACA people stay."" 'VERY POSSIBLE' PARTIAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN LASTS INTO NEW YEAR, INCOMING WH CHIEF OF STAFF TELLS FOX NEWS But House Republicans had overwhelmingly rejected that arrangement. The sprawling, compromise GOP immigration bill that would have provided a path to citizenship for young illegal immigrants while directing $25 billion for the construction of a border wall failed in the House despite encouragement from the president for Republicans to support it, by a 301-121 vote. Kasich concluded by criticizing Trump's announced withdrawal of troops from Syria, saying that while the decision may have fulfilled a campaign promise, it was ""precipitous"" and came too quickly without proper warning to allies in the region. ""The implications of what all this means long-term for our foreign policy, for our domestic agenda, is really up in the air,"" Kasich said. ""It concerns me a great deal."""	nonTerrorism	Politics
"GOP leaders slam Dems, say shutdown meant to keep Trump from fulfilling campaign promise"	" Top Republican lawmakers in both the Senate and the House blamed their Democratic colleagues on Sunday for the ongoing government shutdown, saying that Democrats just want to keep President Trump from fulfilling his campaign promise to build a wall along the United States southern border. “The sticking point is Nancy Pelosi is driving most of the conversation,” Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” about the incoming House Speaker. “This is all about trying to make sure that Donald Trump does not secure the border.” Meadows, the chair of the influential House Freedom Caucus, said that he is hopeful that the government shutdown will be over when the Senate resumes session on Thursday and that funding for the wall will end up being somewhere between $1 billion and $5 billion. Meadows’ comments about the Democrats were echoed by Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., who said that Trump is willing to make a deal, but that the Democrats are trying to undermine the president’s agenda. “This is not about the number, this is about the Democrats not wanting President Trump to fulfill his campaign promise to secure the southern border,” Perdue said. “They’re trying to play politics with the security of our country.” The federal government is expected to remain partially closed past Christmas Day. On the second day of the federal closure, Trump tweeted Sunday that what the country needs is ""a good old fashioned WALL that works,"" as opposed to aerial drones and other measures that ""are wonderful and lots of fun"" not the right answer to address the problem of ""drugs, gangs, human trafficking, criminal elements and much else from coming into"" the United States. With Trump's insistence on $5 billion for the wall and negotiations with Democrats in Congress far from a breakthrough, even a temporary measure to keep the government running while talks continued seems out of reach until the Senate returns for a full session Thursday. Unlike other shutdowns, this one seemed to lack urgency, coming during the long holiday weekend after Trump had already declared Monday, Christmas Eve, a federal holiday. Rather than work around the clock to try to end the shutdown, as they had done in the past, the leaders of the House and the Senate effectively closed up shop. But they didn't rule out action if a deal were struck. Trump's re-election campaign sent out a fundraising email late Saturday launching what he called ""the most important membership program ever - the OFFICIAL BUILD THE WALL MEMBERSHIP."" The president urged donors to sign up. With Democrats set to take control of the House on Jan. 3, and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on his way out, the shutdown was providing a last gasp of the conservative majority before the new Congress. Last week Trump said he would be ""proud"" to close down the government. He had campaigned on the promise of building the wall, and he also promised Mexico would pay for it. Mexico has refused to do so. In recent days, though, Trump tried to shift blame to Democrats for not agreeing to his demand. He has given mixed messages on whether he would sign any bill into law. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York met with Vice President Pence on Saturday at the request of the White House, according to Schumer's office. But the senator's spokesman said they remained ""very far apart"" on a spending agreement. Schumer said the ""Trump shutdown"" could end immediately if the president simply dropped his demand for money. ""If you want to open the government, you must abandon the wall,"" Schumer said. Democrats said they were open to other proposals that didn't include the wall, which Schumer said was too costly and ineffective. They have offered to keep spending at existing levels of $1.3 billion for border fencing and other security. But Trump, digging in, tweeted about ""the crisis of illegal activity"" at American's southern border is ""real and will not stop until we build a great Steel Barrier or Wall.""

"Trump's troop withdrawal is 'a terrible mistake,' former Defense Secretary Panetta says"	"Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta strongly criticized President Trump’s announcement of troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and Syria – saying the move sends “a terrible message” to the United States allies around the globe and threatens the country’s national security. Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” Panetta – who among other roles served as Secretary of Defense under then-President Barack Obama – said that despite good progress the military has made against the Islamic State, the U.S. is far from declaring victory against the terrorist network and withdrawing troops from the Middle East leaves the country vulnerable to terror attacks. “I’ve never seen a situation like this,” Panetta said. “The step to suddenly withdrawal the troops from Syria has sent a terrible message to the world about where we stand.” Panetta’s criticism is just the latest fallout from Trump’s decision to pull all of the roughly 2,000 U.S. forces from Syria in the coming weeks. Earlier in the week, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis announced his departure from the president’s Cabinet and on Friday Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the global coalition fighting ISIS, resigned in protest. ""The recent decision by the president came as a shock and was a complete reversal of policy,"" he said in an email to his staff viewed by The Associated Press. ""It left our coalition partners confused and our fighting partners bewildered with no plan in place or even considered thought as to consequences."" Trump played down the development, tweeting Saturday night that ""I do not know"" the envoy and it's a ""nothing event."" He noted McGurk planned to leave soon anyway and added: ""Grandstander?"" ""We were originally going to be there for three months, and that was seven years ago -- we never left,"" Trump tweeted. ""When I became President, ISIS was going wild. Now ISIS is largely defeated and other local countries, including Turkey, should be able to easily take care of whatever remains. We're coming home!"" Although the civil war in Syria has gone on since 2011, the U.S. did not begin launching airstrikes against IS until September 2014, and American troops did not go into Syria until 2015. Trump's declaration of a victory over IS has been roundly contradicted by his own experts' assessments, and his decision to pull troops out was widely denounced by members of Congress, who called his action rash. Mattis, perhaps the most respected foreign policy official in the administration, announced on Thursday that he will leave by the end of February. He told Trump in a letter that he was departing because ""you have a right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours."" The withdrawal decision will fulfill Trump's goal of bringing troops home from Syria, but military leaders have pushed back for months, arguing that ISIS remains a threat and could regroup in Syria's long-running civil war. U.S. policy has been to keep troops in place until the extremists are eradicated. ISIS militants still hold a string of villages and towns along the Euphrates River in eastern Syria, where they have resisted weeks of attacks by the U.S.-supported Syrian Democratic Forces to drive them out. The pocket is home to about 15,000 people, among them 2,000 IS fighters, according to U.S. military estimates. But that figure could be as high as 8,000 militants, if fighters hiding out in the deserts south of the Euphrates River are also counted, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict through networks of local informants.

Resilient Ruth Bader Ginsburg fights back from latest in line of health woes	" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is resting in a New York hospital following surgery to remove two malignant growths in her left lung, the third time the Supreme Court's oldest justice has been treated for cancer and her second stay in a hospital in two months. Worries over Ginsburg's health have been a constant of sorts for nearly 10 years, and for liberals, particularly in the last two. Ginsburg, the leader of the court's liberal wing and known to her fans as the Notorious RBG, has achieved an iconic status rare for Supreme Court justices. If she did step down, President Donald Trump would have another opportunity to move a conservative court even more to the right. ""Wishing Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg a full and speedy recovery!"" Trump tweeted after the court's announcement Friday. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But Ginsburg has always bounced back before, flaunting her physical and mental fitness. After past health scares, she has resumed the exercise routine popularized in a book written by her personal trainer and captured in a Stephen Colbert video. Weeks after cracking three ribs in a fall at the Supreme Court in November, the 85-year-old Ginsburg was asking questions at high court arguments, speaking at a naturalization ceremony for new citizens and being interviewed at screenings of the new movie about her, ""On the Basis of Sex."" Ginsburg will remain in the hospital for a few days, the court said. She has never missed arguments in more than 25 years as a justice. The court next meets on Jan. 7. While it's hard to refer to good luck and cancer diagnoses in the same breath, this is the second time for Ginsburg that cancerous growths have been detected at an apparently early stage through unrelated medical tests. RUTH BADER GINSBURG HAS PULMONARY LOBECTOMY: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE PROCEDURE The nodules on her lung were found during X-rays and other tests Ginsburg had after she fractured ribs in a fall in her Supreme Court office on Nov. 7, the court said. In 2009, routine follow-up screening after Ginsburg's colorectal cancer 10 years earlier detected a lesion on her pancreas. Doctors operated and removed the growth they'd previously spotted, plus a smaller one they hadn't seen before. The larger growth was benign, while the smaller one was malignant. Doctors who are not involved in Ginsburg's care said she may have gotten lucky again, although they caution it is too soon to know. ""This is just luck"" that the growths were found through those rib X-rays because accidentally discovered lung tumors tend to be early-stage when surgery works best, said Dr. Giuseppe Giaccone, an oncologist at Georgetown University's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center. Dr. John Lazar, director of thoracic robotic surgery at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, said it's not uncommon to see slow-growing lung cancers in women in their 80s, and they tend to respond well to surgery and go on to die of something unrelated, he said. Ginsburg's previous bouts with cancer were so long ago they're unlikely to be related, Giaccone said. ""If she doesn't need anything but the surgery, it is a very good sign,"" Lazar said. Both doctors said patients typically spend three days or four days in the hospital after this type of operation. On Friday, doctors at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York performed a procedure called a pulmonary lobectomy on Ginsburg. The growths they removed were determined to be malignant in an initial pathology evaluation, the court said, citing Ginsburg's thoracic surgeon, Dr. Valerie W. Rusch. But there was ""no evidence of any remaining disease"" and scans taken before the surgery showed no cancerous growths elsewhere in her body, the court said. No additional treatment is currently planned, it said. Among other health problems, she also broke two ribs in a fall in 2012 and had a stent implanted to open a blocked artery in 2014. She was hospitalized after a bad reaction to medicine in 2009. Appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993, Ginsburg rebuffed suggestions from some liberals that she should step down in the first two years of President Barack Obama's second term, when Democrats controlled the Senate and would have been likely to confirm her successor. She already has hired clerks for the term that extends into 2020, indicating she has no plans to retire. The Associated Press contributed to this report"	nonTerrorism	Politics
Schumer demands Trump 'abandon the wall' as DC faces shutdown stalemate	" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called on President Trump to ""abandon the wall"" Saturday if he wants to reopen the government, saying Trump does not have the votes in the Senate to get it funded -- hours after the government shut down over an impasse over funding for Trump's signature 2016 campaign promise. ""It will never pass the Senate, not today, not next week, not next year. So President Trump, if you want to open the government, you must abandon the wall, plain and simple,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor. The partial shutdown began at midnight Saturday, a few hours after the House and Senate adjourned without getting a funding agreement to the president's desk. The shutdown was expected to last at least a few days, with sources on both sides of the aisle telling Fox News that Washington could be in for a prolonged shutdown. The Senate adjourned Saturday afternoon and was not due to meet for a scheduled session until Thursday. Early Saturday evening, the House also concluded for the day. Vice President Mike Pence and Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney arrived at the Capitol Saturday afternoon to meet with Schumer to continue negotiations for an end to the stalemate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said that ""productive discussions are continuing."" ""When those negotiations produce a solution that is acceptable to all parties -- which means 60 votes in the Senate, a majority in the House, and a presidential signature -- at that point, we will take it up here on the Senate floor,"" he said. Late Saturday afternoon, a Schumer spokesman said that ""the vice president came in for a discussion and made an offer. Unfortunately, we're still very far apart."" In a letter addressed to fellow Democratic colleagues on Saturday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., wrote that ""Last night, Republicans shut down the government."" She added that barring any developments, making ""progress to end the Trump Shutdown in the next several days"" was not anticipated. ""Until President Trump can publicly commit to a bipartisan resolution, there will be no agreement before January when the new House Democratic Majority will swiftly pass legislation to re-open government,"" Pelosi wrote, before expressing her wishes for a happy holiday. With the standoff grinding on, the White House revealed on Saturday that the president planned to stay in the nation's capital over the holiday. “Due to the shutdown, President Trump will remain in Washington, D.C. and the First Lady will return from Florida so they can spend Christmas together,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The main sticking point for negotiations was funding for Trump's signature 2016 campaign promise of a wall on the southern border. Trump had demanded $5.7 billion for wall funding, and a bill with that funding attached passed the House on Friday. But efforts have derailed in the Senate, where 60 votes were required for passage, and therefore Democrat votes are needed in conjunction with support by the GOP. Democrats have poured cold water on the idea that they would support anything close to that. Schumer, in his remarks Saturday, said that the wall was a ""bone to the hard right"" and that they had proposed $1.3 billion for ""border security."" ""I’ve heard the president and his allies in the media say that Democrats don’t support border security. Nothing could be further from the truth. Democrats have always been for smart and effective ways to secure our border,"" he said. ""We are pushing for technology, like drones and sensors, and inspection equipment."" McConnell accused Democrats of backing away from past support for border security, and said they were rejecting a ""reasonable request"" for the $5 billion in funding. ""They’ve refused to meet President Trump halfway and provide even one-fifth of the resources for the border they were willing to provide just a few months ago,"" he said on the Senate floor. Trump has been keen to blame Democrats for the impasse and on Friday urged McConnell to invoke the so-called “nuclear option” which would change Senate procedure to require only a simple majority to approve the bill -- therefore allowing Republicans to override Democratic objections. “Mitch, use the Nuclear Option and get it done! Our Country is counting on you!” he tweeted on Friday. IF TRUMP DOESN'T GET WALL FUNDING, IT COULD SPELL TROUBLE FOR HIS 'ELECTORAL FUTURE': MOLLIE HEMINGWAY Late Friday he emphasized the need for a wall in a video he posted to Twitter, and he blamed the shutdown on the Democrats. “We’re going to have a shutdown, there’s nothing we can do about that because we need the Democrats to give us their votes,” he said. “Call it a Democrat shutdown, call it whatever you want, but we need their help to get this approved.” That contrasted with remarks he made last week during an explosive Oval Office face-off with Schumer and Pelosi, in which he said he was ""proud"" to shut down the government for border security. ""I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I’m not going to blame you for it,” he said. On Saturday, Trump held a lunch at the White House to discuss border security with staff and top conservatives including Reps. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. The inclusion of some of the more hardline voices on immigration could likely serve to harden Trump's resolve against backing down on the wall. WHAT HAPPENS DURING A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN? 7 THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW The Senate appropriations bill passed on Wednesday is the base bill for funding, and that allocated $1.6 billion for border security. But it did not spend all money available under sequestration caps. There is an extra $900 million available, that could theoretically go toward funding the wall. If that was allocated, it could offer Trump a total wall/border package of about $2.5 billion. While there appeared to be little movement on Saturday, Sunday was expected to be a key day for negotiations to end the shutdown. Lawmakers were aiming for a tentative agreement on all seven outstanding appropriation bills, to be funded until the end of September 2019. A senior source close to the negotiations told Fox News that they will aim to “see by Sunday morning if there is a center of gravity” for nailing down a deal. Fox News is told Trump would accept the increase in wall funding, and that the administration believes it can find additional wall money across various federal programs that could be “reprogrammed” for the wall. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said on ""America's Newsroom"" this week that there were ""other ways that we can get to that $5 billion."" Congress has a little bit of wiggle room for movement as it has a weekend, followed by Christmas Eve -- for which Trump has given federal workers a day off -- and then Christmas Day. So that means that the partial shutdown will not fully bite until Wednesday. About one-quarter of the government will be affected in a shutdown. Nine of the 15 Cabinet-level departments are to shutter, along with dozens of agencies. Those departments are: Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, State, Transportation and Treasury. Essential personnel would still be required to work but without pay. Nearly 90 percent of the Homeland Security staff is deemed essential. Roughly 420,000 workers will be deemed essential and will work unpaid, while more than 380,000 people will be furloughed in the shutdown – meaning they will experience a temporary leave from their work GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN 2018: WHAT WILL CLOSE AND WHO STILL NEEDS TO WORK This will include most of NASA, Housing and Urban Development, Commerce and National Park Service workers. Additionally, about 52,000 IRS workers would be furloughed. The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) will remain open as usual during a partial government shutdown because it is “an independent entity that is funded through the sale of our products and services, and not by tax dollars,” a spokesman told Fox News. TSA agents, air traffic controllers and border security agents also will be required to work through a shutdown – albeit they might not get a paycheck right away. Amtrak, a government-owned corporation, also will continue with normal operations during a short-term shutdown, a spokeswoman confirmed to Fox News. Members of Congress will continue to be paid, as legislative branch appropriations had already been approved back in September, and the 27th Amendment bars ““varying the compensation” for lawmakers until after each election.

"Trump tweets reaction to McGurk, Mattis resignations"	"President Trump on Saturday night reacted to the resignation of Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the global coalition to defeat the Islamic State group (ISIS), while also offering a new response to the departure of his defense secretary, James Mattis. Trump took to social media to say he'd neither met nor appointed McGurk, while also suggesting that the official was a “grandstander.” “Brett McGurk, who I do not know, was appointed by President Obama in 2015. Was supposed to leave in February but he just resigned prior to leaving. Grandstander?” Trump tweeted. “The Fake News is making such a big deal about this nothing event!” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP McGurk tendered his resignation following Trump’s decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria, Fox News confirmed earlier Saturday. U.S. officials said this week that the Trump administration was making plans to pull all 2,000 troops out of Syria. In his resignation letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, McGurk said that ISIS was on the run but wasn’t yet defeated and that U.S. military’s work in Syria had not yet been completed, the Associated Press reported. “If anybody but your favorite President, Donald J. Trump, announced that, after decimating ISIS in Syria, we were going to bring our troops back home (happy & healthy), that person would be the most popular hero in America,” Trump continued on Twitter Saturday. “With me, hit hard instead by the Fake News Media. Crazy!” BRETT MCGURK, US ENVOY TO ANTI-ISIS COALITION, RESIGNS IN WAKE OF TRUMP DECISION TO PULL TROOPS FROM SYRIA Fox News confirmed that McGurk submitted his resignation letter on Friday, just one day after Mattis. Trump revealed Thursday that Mattis would “be retiring, with distinction, at the end of February” as head of the Defense Department. The president went on to praise the “tremendous progress” made during Mattis’ time in the role, adding that he’d been “a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations.” However, on Saturday, Trump took a somewhat different tack, saying he'd given Mattis “a second chance” when offering him the position of defense secretary. “When President Obama ingloriously fired Jim Mattis, I gave him a second chance,” Trump tweeted. “Some thought I shouldn’t, I thought I should. Interesting relationship-but I also gave all of the resources that he never really had. Allies are very important-but not when they take advantage of U.S.” Trump may have been referring to a 2013 report by Foreign Policy that said Mattis wasn't informed of his ouster by the Obama administration as head of U.S. Central Command until an aide passed him a note saying the Pentagon had named his replacement. Mattis had succeeded David Petreaus in the role. DEFENSE SECRETARY JAMES MATTIS TO RETIRE AT THE END OF FEBRUARY, TRUMP SAYS In Mattis’ resignation letter to Trump, the former Marine Corps general acknowledged that a strong nation relies on a ""comprehensive"" network of alliances, and must be ""resolute and unambiguous"" in approaching countries with strategic differences, citing China and Russia. ""Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position,"" Mattis wrote. Sources told Fox News this week that Mattis' resignation was ""in protest"" against the president's national security policies.

"Brett McGurk, US envoy to anti-ISIS coalition, resigns in wake of Trump decision to pull troops from Syria"	"Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy for the global coalition to defeat Islamic State (ISIS), has resigned in the wake of President Trump’s decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria, Fox News confirmed Saturday -- coming on the heels of the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis earlier this week. U.S. officials said this week that the Trump administration is making plans to pull all 2,000 troops out of Syria, and Trump later tweeted that “we have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.” Ground troops moved into Syria in 2015 to combat ISIS in the region, amid an escalating Syrian civil war. Trump had talked about pulling out of Syria before, but military leaders had warned about ISIS re-emerging should the U.S. do so. There is also concern about abandoning the U.S.' Kurdish allies. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP On Thursday, Trump announced that Mattis was retiring in February. Mattis’ resignation letter said that Trump had a right to a Defense Secretary “whose views are better aligned with yours” on policy. Sources told Fox News this week that Mattis' resignation was ""in protest"" over the president's national security policies and that more resignations could be coming. The Associated Press reported that McGurk said in a resignation letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that ISIS was on the run, but wasn’t yet defeated and that U.S. work in Syria wasn’t yet done. Fox News has confirmed that McGurk submitted his resignation letter on Friday, a day after Secretary Mattis resigned. His resignation is effective December 31. His resignation was first reported by CBS News. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERING PLAN TO PULL ALL US FORCES OUT OF SYRIA, OFFICIALS SAY The president reacted to the news via Twitter Saturday evening, saying he had neither met McGurk nor appointed him. ""Brett McGurk, who I do not know, was appointed by President Obama in 2015. Was supposed to leave in February but he just resigned prior to leaving,"" Trump tweeted. ""Grandstander? The Fake News is making such a big deal about this nothing event!"" ""If anybody but your favorite President, Donald J. Trump, announced that, after decimating ISIS in Syria, we were going to bring our troops back home (happy & healthy), that person would be the most popular hero in America,"" he continued in a follow-up tweet. ""With me, hit hard instead by the Fake News Media. Crazy!"" McGurk, who was an Obama appointee in 2015, had said in a Dec. 11 press conference that it would be ""reckless"" to consider ISIS defeated and that the “enduring defeat of a group like this means you can’t just defeat their physical space and then leave.” “Nobody is saying that they are going to disappear. Nobody is that naive,” he told reporters. “So we want to stay on the ground and make sure that stability can be maintained in these areas.” An official told the Associated Press that McGurk was planning to leave the job in mid-February, but felt he could no longer continue after Trump’s decision and Mattis’ resignation. BEHIND THE SCENES OF THE MATTIS BOMBSHELL: MORE RESIGNATIONS EXPECTED AFTER 'PROTEST' EXIT McGurk previously served as a deputy assistant secretary of state for Iraq and Iran, and led secret side talks with Iran about the release of American prisoners during the negotiations for the Iran nuclear deal. McGurk had previously worked as a Supreme Court law clerk to the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist. He had also served on former President George W. Bush’s National Security Council staff, where in 2007 and 2008, he was the lead U.S. negotiator on security agreements with Iraq. McGurk’s departure is the latest sign of criticism from Trump’s allies in his administration, and in Congress, for the decision. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. recently blasted Trump for his decision to pull troops out of Syria, calling it an ""Obama-like decision"" -- an allusion to Obama's decision to pull troops from Iraq in 2011. In return, Trump fired back, saying it was difficult to understand why Graham would be against saving countless lives. ""So hard to believe that Lindsey Graham would be against saving soldier lives & billions of $$$. Why are we fighting for our enemy, Syria, by staying & killing ISIS for them, Russia, Iran & other locals? Time to focus on our Country & bring our youth back home where they belong!"" Trump tweeted. On Saturday, Trump said that ISIS is “largely defeated” and that other countries, such as Turkey could take care of whatever is left.

 What happens during a government shutdown? 7 things you should know	"Concerns about the potential of another government shutdown were once again circulating after President Trump said he'd be willing to halt operations if Congress doesn't approve funding for his U.S.-Mexico border wall. But the potential became a reality Friday when Democrats and Trump were seemingly at an impasse over a spending bill – particularly in regards to funding for border security. The government partially shuttered at midnight as a result, just in time for the Christmas break. Trump has warned that a closure could drag on “for a very long time.” Prior to the partial shutdown, Trump had urged Senate Republicans to use the so-called “nuclear option” to pass a spending bill that includes enough funding for a border wall. The House scrambled to put together a package late Thursday that included the $5.7 billion the president wants but was unable to agree on a deal to fund the government by Friday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has often rebuffed calls to use the nuclear option, which would change Senate procedure to require only a simple majority to approve the spending bill. The Senate plans to reconvene at noon on Dec. 22  to continue talks. TRUMP CLASHES WITH PELOSI, SCHUMER ON BORDER SECURITY IN EXPLOSIVE OVAL OFFICE MEETING Fox News previously asked Marc Goldwein, senior policy director of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget – a bipartisan, nonprofit organization that educates the public on fiscal policy issues – to explain a government shutdown, and he answered seven basic questions about the process that Americans should know. A shutdown occurs when Congress and the president fail to sign into law 12 appropriations bills (which determine spending for specific government agencies) in order to continue providing funding for government operations. To avoid a shutdown, members of Congress can give themselves an extension, known as a continuing resolution (CR). The temporary funding measure keeps the federal government open and allows lawmakers more time to negotiate the remaining appropriations bills. “The bar for a CR is pretty low. You’re not agreeing to anything new politically; it’s a no-brainer,” Goldwein told Fox News. As long as it takes. Congressional leaders from both parties have to reach an agreement to fund the government. It usually takes a weekend for this to happen. A LOOK BACK AT EVERY GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN IN US HISTORY “We’re talking days or weeks – not months,” Goldwein said. ""Essential staff at top level agencies would continue working, but most federal employees whose jobs aren’t vital would likely be sent home,"" Goldwein said. For example, those who work at national parks, monuments and museums would be told to go home. ""It doesn’t feel awesome to be told you’re not an essential employee. It's a little demoralizing to go home because you’re not important,"" Goldwein added. In the 2013 shutdown, roughly 850,000 employees were furloughed per day, according to the Office of Management and Budget. But not everyone is required to take unpaid leave. The president, presidential appointees and members of Congress are exempt. The Postal Service, the TSA and Air Traffic Control will also continue business as usual. Americans will still be able to get their Social Security and Medicare benefits and food stamps. However, people expecting VA benefits, unemployment benefits, farm subsidies and tax refunds may experience delays. Most likely. The problem: They're not sure when they'll get their money. ""Everyone loses from the government shutdown. An employee loses their paycheck at the time he or she needs it,"" Goldwein said. ""Ultimately, we’re going to fund it anyway. It’s kind of silly."" Federal employees typically receive back pay shortly upon their return, though, Goldwein says, nothing is certain. Every agency has their own contingency plan in the event of a shutdown. The government has shut down 20 times since 1976, the year Congress introduced the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s research. Half of the shutdowns occurred over a weekend. “Before 1980, the government didn’t really shut down,” Goldwein explained. “A lot of others were over the course of weekends. I call them ‘fake shutdowns.’” Goldwein says there have really only been three significant government shutdowns in the history of the U.S. Two occurred during the Clinton administration in the winter of 1995 to 1996. Former President Bill Clinton and the Republican Congress were at odds and shut the government down for a total of 26 days, Goldwein said. The third occurred during the Obama administration in 2013 when a stalemate between the House and Senate led to a 16-day hiatus. The 16-day government shutdown in 2013 cost the country $24 billion of lost economic activity, according to an analysis from ratings agency Standard & Poor's. ""The payroll cost of furloughed employee salaries alone – that is, the lost productivity of furloughed workers – was $2.0 billion,"" the Office of Management and Budget reported in 2013. Goldwein says shutdowns ""waste money"" more than they ""cost money."" ""We’re not going to spend more money. We’re just going to spend it on worse stuff,"" he explained. ""Instead of paying employees to work, we’re paying them not to work.""

A look back at every government shutdown in US history	"Lawmakers were hoping to prevent another government shutdown in 2018 -- but failed to reach a deal by midnight Saturday. As a result, the federal government partially shut down just ahead of Christmas. The government has now shut down a total of 21 times since Congress introduced the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act, which established the federal budget process in 1976. Half of those shutdowns occurred over a weekend. ""I call them 'fake shutdowns,'"" Marc Goldwein, senior policy director of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget – a bipartisan, nonprofit organization that educates the public on fiscal policy issues –previously told Fox News. “Most shutdowns occur over the course of a weekend. We’re talking days or weeks – not months.” WHAT HAPPENS DURING A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN? 7 THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW But there have been a handful of lengthy U.S. government shutdowns. According to data from the Congressional Research Service (CRS), six shutdowns in the past four decades lasted more than 10 days. However, Goldwein said only three of those shutdowns are significant. Two occurred during the Clinton administration in the winter of 1995 to 1996 when former President Bill Clinton and the Republican Congress were at odds and shut the government down for a total of 26 days, Goldwein said. The third occurred during the Obama administration in 2013. A stalemate between the House and Senate led to a 16-day hiatus. Here is a look back at every government shutdown in the history of the U.S. The first partial shutdown occurred under Gerald Ford’s presidency when Ford vetoed a $56 billion spending bill for the Departments of Labor and Health, Education and Welfare, according to a 1976 report from The New York Times. This was the year the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act became law, allowing Congress to take an extension, known as a continuing resolution (CR). There were three shutdowns, referred to as the ""abortion shutdowns,"" in the late 1970s under the presidency of Jimmy Carter. The Democratic party may have dominated both the House and the Senate, but they couldn't get Republicans on board when it came to using Medicaid to pay for abortions. In 1978, Carter vetoed a $37 billion defense authorization bill, which included a $2 billion nuclear-powered Nimitz-class aircraft carrier -- equipment he didn't consider essential to national security, The Washington Post reported. This led to the second largest shutdown in the history of the nation. Another funding gap took place a year later when the House and Senate disagreed over raising pay by 5.5 percent for members of Congress and senior civil servants, The Washington Post reported. And there was yet again another debate over abortion funding. President Ronald Reagan vetoed a spending bill because it didn't make enough cuts. The government shut down for one day when Congress failed to pass the spending bill on time. Both the House and Senate wanted to increase public works spending in order to create more jobs -- a move Reagan opposed. The House also opposed MX missile funding, which, The Washington Post noted, was a ""major defense priority"" of Reagan's. Reagan argued over the Democratic-controlled House's proposed foreign aid and spending cuts and their plea for an increase in funding for education. At the same time, Reagan was pushing for more funding for the MX missile. In short, Reagan agreed to the House's proposed crime-fighting package, but he opposed their water projects package. ""Reagan offered to forgo his crime bill in exchange for junking the water package...but a deal wasn't reached in time to avoid a brief shutdown,"" The Washington Post reported. Lawmakers reportedly needed another day to discuss the spending bill. The Democratic-controlled House was once again in disagreement with Reagan and the Republican-controlled Senate. This time, over a welfare package deal. Reagan and Democrats couldn't agree on funding for Nicaraguan ""Contra"" militants. Democrats also pushed to reinstate the ""Fairness Doctrine,"" which required licensed broadcasters to give equal air time for people with competing political points of view. Only one shutdown took place during George H.W. Bush’s presidency. It occurred in October 1990 after Bush vetoed a stopgap spending bill, The New York Times reported at the time. But the timing was right. The shutdown happened over Columbus Day weekend and most federal workers were already off for the holiday. ""The government is partially shutting down because Congress has failed to pass the straightforward legislation necessary to keep the government running without imposing sharp hikes in Medicare premiums and deep cuts in education and the environment,"" Clinton said during an address on Nov. 14, 1995. It's the longest shutdown in U.S. history: 21 days. The government shut down after Clinton vetoed the spending bill proposed by the Republican-controlled Congress. After a long three weeks, the president and Congress agreed to a seven-year budget plan, which included ""modest spending cuts and tax increases,"" according to research by the Regional Oral History Office at the University of California, Berkeley. Seventeen years later, the government shut down once again. Lawmakers couldn't come to an agreement on the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, in 2013. The House passed several versions of the bill to fund the government. But each time, the Senate sent it back. “This is an unnecessary blow to America,” Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic leader at the time, said of the shutdown. John Boehner, the House speaker during the shutdown, said Republicans were fighting to keep the government open, but the Senate ""continued to reject our offers.” When it comes to immigration and spending, President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers and Democrats were divided. Republicans controlled the Senate but they still needed 60 votes to break a filibuster. ""When you only have 51 votes in the Senate, then you have to have Democrat support in order to keep the government — to fund the government,"" OMB Director Mick Mulvaney told reporters during a White House press briefing Friday. Democrats said from the beginning that they'd reject any deal that didn't include a legislative fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, an Obama-era program, which offers protection for immigrants — also known as ""Dreamers"" — who came into the U.S. illegally as minors. “I am proud of House and Senate Democrats’ unity in insisting on a budget that supports our military and the domestic investments that keep our nation strong, and that honors our values by protecting the DREAMers,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement as the government shut down. Trump, on the other hand, said Democrats only had themselves to blame when it came to both shutting down the government and failing to make a deal on DACA. ""Deals can’t get made when there is no trust! Durbin blew DACA and is hurting our Military,"" Trump tweeted. ""DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don’t really want it, they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military."" In the end, Democrats reached a compromise to reopen the government through Feb. 8 — with one condition. “After several discussions, offers, counter-offers, the Republican leader and I have come to an arrangement,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, said on the Senate floor. ""We will vote today to reopen the government to continue negotiating a global agreement, with the commitment that, if an agreement isn’t reached by February 8, the Senate will immediately proceed to consideration of legislation dealing with DACA.” Republican and Democratic senators announced a two-year budget agreement on Feb. 7 that included an increase in military spending, an extension for the Children’s Health Insurance Program and additional funds for disaster relief, among other issues. ""I am pleased to announce that our bipartisan, bicameral negotiations on defense spending and other priorities have yielded a significant agreement,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a speech on the House floor. It's a deal ""neither side loves, but both sides can be proud of,"" Senate Minority Leader Schumer, D-N.Y., added. But not everyone was a fan of the deal. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., slammed the plan for not addressing immigration. ""[The] package does nothing to advance bipartisan legislation to protect Dreamers in the House,"" said Pelosi, as she shared the stories of ""Dreamers"" on the House floor for more than eight hours. ""Without a commitment from Speaker Ryan comparable to the commitment from Leader McConnell, this package does not have my support."" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., also voiced his frustration with the deal, which he said irresponsibly busted through budget caps and increased the country's deficit even more. ""I ran for office because I was very critical of President Obama's trillion-dollar deficits,"" Paul said. ""Now we have Republicans hand in hand with Democrats offering us trillion-dollar deficits. I can't in all honesty look the other way."" A last-minute maneuver by Paul led to an hours-long shutdown. In the end, Congress agreed to pass the $400 billion deal and it was on Trump's desks within hours. He announced that he had signed the bill at 8:40 a.m. ET. Democrats and President Trump were seemingly at an impasse over a spending bill – particularly in regards to funding for border security. As a result, and just ahead of Christmas, the government partially shuttered at midnight.

"Would a government shutdown impact holiday travel, mail?"	"Just in time for Christmas, the government partially shut down at midnight Saturday. The federal government and Democrats were at an impasse, with funding for a border wall at the center of the fight. President Trump had urged Senate Republicans to use the so-called “nuclear option” to pass a spending bill that includes enough funding for a border wall. The House scrambled to put together a package late Thursday that included the $5.7 billion the president wants but was unable to agree on a deal to fund the government by Friday. Trump has warned that a closure could drag on “for a very long time.” The dispute could affect nine of 15 Cabinet-level departments and dozens of agencies, including the departments of Homeland Security, Transportation, Interior, Agriculture, State and Justice, as well as national parks and forests. Every agency has a contingency plan, as managed by the Office of Management and Budget. A shutdown would impact more than 800,000 people, including more than 420,000 who would still be required to work but without pay, Senate Democrats have estimated. More than 380,000 government employees would be furloughed, lawmakers said. Here’s a look at how your holiday services will fare now that the government has shuttered ahead of Christmas. You can still mail your Christmas list to Santa even if the government is shuttered as the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) confirmed neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night nor a shutdown would deter the mail. “Postal Service operations will not be interrupted in the event of a government shutdown, and all Post Offices will remain open for business as usual. Because we are an independent entity that is funded through the sale of our products and services, and not by tax dollars, our services will not be impacted by a government shutdown,” a spokesman confirmed to Fox News. GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN 2018: WHAT WOULD CLOSE AND WHO WOULD STILL NEED TO WORK While it would still be open, the USPS has warned it officially entered Monday what it predicts to be its busiest week. The Postal Service expects to deliver about 3 billion pieces of mail just this week. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents would still screen holiday travelers during one of the busiest times of the years – although they might not get a paycheck right away in the event of a shutdown, according to NPR. In addition to TSA agents, air traffic controllers and border security agents are deemed essential personnel and would be required to work through a government shutdown. DEMS, WHITE HOUSE REFUSE TO BUDGE OVER BORDER WALL AS FRIDAY SHUTDOWN LOOMS Amtrak, a government-owned corporation, will continue with normal operations during a short-term shutdown, spokeswoman Kimberly Woods confirmed to Fox News. “Customers planning to travel on Amtrak trains in the Northeast Corridor and across the country in the coming days and weeks can be assured that Amtrak will remain open for business,” she said. When the government shut down earlier this year, travelers were still able to get their passports, albeit with some delays, according to CNBC. North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) will continue to track Santa, even if the government shuts down, it confirmed. ""Military personnel who conduct NORAD Tracks Santa are supported by approximately 1,500 volunteers who make the program possible each and every year,"" NORAD said in confirming the 63-year tradition will continue.

Government shutdown 2018: What will close and who still needs to work	"With Democrats and President Trump seemingly at an impasse over a spending bill – particularly in regards to funding for border security – the government partially shuttered at midnight, just in time for the Christmas break.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has often rebuffed calls to use the nuclear option, which would change Senate procedure to require only a simple majority to approve the spending bill. The Senate plans to reconvene at noon Saturday to continue talks. About one-quarter of the government will be affected in a shutdown. According to a precedent set during the Reagan administration, federal workers can be exempt from furloughs if their jobs are related to national security or if they perform essential activities that “protect life and property.” Read on for a look at which agencies are closed during a partial shutdown and who still is expected at work. Nine of the 15 Cabinet-level departments will shutter, along with dozens of agencies. Those departments are: Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, State, Transportation and Treasury. Essential personnel would still be required to work but without pay. Nearly 90 percent of the Homeland Security staff is deemed essential. WHAT IS THE ‘NUCLEAR OPTION,’ THE STEP TRUMP WANTS THE SENATE TO TAKE? With the Interior Department impacted, many national parks and forests will close. More than 420,000 people – including law enforcement and Homeland Security workers – will have to work with their pay withheld, according to Senate Democrats. About 53,000 TSA employees, 54,000 Customs and Border Protection agents and 42,000 Coast Guard workers would be required to work without pay. TRUMP BACKS CALL TO NUKE FILIBUSTER IN DRIVE TO PASS BORDER WALL FUNDING AS SHUTDOWN LOOMS Additionally, about 5,000 Forest Service firefighters would need to work, according to Senate Democrats. More than 380,000 people will be furloughed in the shutdown – meaning they will experience a temporary leave from their work. This will include most of NASA, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Commerce Department and National Park Service workers. Additionally, about 52,000 IRS workers would be furloughed. The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) will remain open as usual during a partial government shutdown because it is “an independent entity that is funded through the sale of our products and services, and not by tax dollars,” a spokesman told Fox News.

"If Trump doesn’t get wall funding, it could spell trouble for his ‘electoral future’: Mollie Hemingway"	"President Trump may be facing some political trouble in the future if he doesn’t succeed in getting funding for his border wall, Mollie Hemingway, a senior editor for the Federalist, suggested on the ""Special Report"" All-Star panel Friday night. After Trump reversed course from what critics perceived as him “caving” on funding the wall -- something he famously campaigned on during the 2016 presidential election -- Trump doubled down on his threat of a partial government shutdown, which was triggered at midnight Friday after Congress failed to meet a deadline for passing a spending plan. All-Stars Hemingway, along with Washington Examiner commentary writer Tom Rogan and U.S. News & World Report senior writer David Catanese, all weighed in on the potential political fallout of the shutdown. Hemingway began by arguing that the lack of an “incentive structure” has prevented meaningful immigration reform and that both Democrats and Republicans have benefited by “using the issue without actually solving it.” “What makes this very interesting is Donald Trump has no incentive to do anything other than wait for a bill that provides money for the border fence,” Hemingway told the panel. ""I mean, he could wait as long as he wants, partly because we’ve got a government that’s 75 percent funded, but also because if he does not provide this, it is a very serious problem for him and his electoral future. And he has no incentive to accept anything other than meaningful border wall funding.” She added that Democrats might be “playing into his hands” since they have already supported border security in the past. However, Catanese pushed back, insisting that Trump's demand for a wall was “symbolic,” and that’s where the “opposition is.” “The president even changed the language on this,” Catanese said. “He’s talking about slats and not a wall!” Catanese suggested that Democrats “hold the cards” in this budget battle, pointing out that Vice President Mike Pence, senior White House official Jared Kushner, and Office of Management and Budget director and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney went to Capitol Hill to meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. Meanwhile, Rogan asserted that Trump “wants” the shutdown in the wake of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis' resignation because the president wants to show heading toward 2020 that he’s still the “hard-charging” candidate his voters elected in 2016. Rogan added that it was to the president’s benefit that Democrats were being seen as opposing border security by a lot of America, so the perception would likely be negative for their candidates. “So this may flip in his favor later on,"" Rogan said."	nonTerrorism	Politics
Ohio's Kasich vetoes lawmakers' $13G pay hike tacked onto aid for first-responders' families	"Ohio Gov. John Kasich vetoed a bill Friday that would have increased benefits for deceased first responders' families because lawmakers tacked onto the bill a $13,000 pay increase for themselves, according to reports. But some of the bill's supporters said they hoped to see Kasich's veto overridden next week. The proposed pay increase for state lawmakers was added to the bill late in the session in before the final vote last week, reports said. In Senate Bill 296, Ohio lawmakers would be increasing their salaries from $60,584 to $73,167 annually by 2028, the Washington Free Beacon reported. It would be their first pay raise in 10 years, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported. The bill also called for increasing the base pay over a 10-year period, while also increasing benefits for widows and children of deceased police officers and firefighters, the reports said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""I would have signed such a bill into law,"" Kasich wrote, referring to the assistance for first responders' families, according to the Enquirer. ""Unfortunately, I cannot support or condone the last-minute rush to include a controversial pay raise for elected officials into what was an otherwise commendable bill."" The bill was sponsored by Republican state Sen. Jay Hottinger of Newark, who tweeted his displeasure on Friday. First responders and their families also disagreed with the governor's action. “It’s unfortunate that he couldn’t allow this bill to become law and we’re going to work hard to get it overridden,” Jay McDonald, a past president of the Ohio Fraternal Order of Police, told the Dayton Daily News. “The fallen officers and their families deserve better than this and we need to remember them, especially this time of year.” But another Republican, Frank LaRose of Hudson, who was initially a sponsor of SB296, took his name off the bill, referring to the pay increases in a tweet as an ""11th hour maneuver."" On Friday, Kasich also vetoed a controversial bill that would have outlawed abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, effectively banning abortion after the first few weeks of a pregnancy, the Hill reported. The bill is also known as the ""heartbeat bill."" But the Ohio governor signed legislation that would ban the dilation and evacuation (or ""D&E"") procedures, which have been used for 95 percent of second-trimester abortions nationally, the report said. The law effectively bans most abortions as early as 12 weeks into a pregnancy, according to the report. About 17 percent of abortions performed in Ohio last year used this method. Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst for the Guttmacher Institute, a policy group that supports abortion rights, said the heartbeat bill may have won veto-proof majorities for the first time in the Ohio House and Senate as the latest class of conservative lawmakers looks to make their mark on one of the last remaining wedge issues. ""Ohio has added so many abortion restrictions that this was just about the only thing left to pass. Ohio has the 20-week ban, waiting period, counseling, ultrasound, clinic regulations,"" she said. ""So Ohio has every single abortion restriction on the books. This is what's left."" Kasich this week also vetoed a bill calling for a ""stand your ground"" policy on shootings, but added he would support a better gun bill. “If you think I’m going to sign a bill that gives more power to the gun folks, are you kidding me?” Kasich told reporters, according to the Enquirer.

Partial government shutdown triggered as funding lapses amid border wall dispute	"Funding for a slew of federal agencies lapsed at midnight after Congress and the White House failed to pass a spending package amid a bruising fight over border wall funding. The missed deadline means nine of 15 Cabinet-level departments and dozens of agencies will close just as the Christmas break begins. But it does not mean the whole federal government is affected: Only about a quarter of the government is actually shutting down. The Senate planned to reconvene at noon Saturday to continue talks. Congress had been facing a Friday deadline to fund a portion of the government or risk the partial shutdown. But even though negotiations continue, lawmakers left the Capitol on Friday without a deal to fund the government by midnight’s deadline. Over the last few weeks, Republicans and Democrats had been at a standstill over the president’s demands for $5 billion to fund the border wall. ""This is our only chance that we'll ever have, in our opinion, because of the world and the way it breaks out, to get great border security,"" President Trump said earlier Friday. Democrats will take control of the House on Jan. 3, and they oppose major funding for wall construction. But not long after midnight, Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi issued a joint statement, pinning the blame for the partial shutdown squarely on the president. ""Regrettably, America has now entered a Trump Shutdown,"" the Democrats wrote. ""Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House. But instead of honoring his responsibility to the American people, President Trump threw a temper tantrum and convinced House Republicans to push our nation into a destructive Trump Shutdown in the middle of the holiday season. President Trump has said more than 25 times that he wanted a shutdown and now he has gotten what he wanted. ""Democrats have offered Republicans multiple proposals to keep the government open,"" they continued, ""including one that already passed the Senate unanimously, and all of which include funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security – not the president's ineffective and expensive wall. If President Trump and Republicans choose to continue this Trump Shutdown, the new House Democratic majority will swiftly pass legislation to re-open government in January."" Much of the drama Friday took place in the Senate: After keeping the vote open for five hours to secure enough support, the Senate finally advanced a House-approved spending bill with $5.7 billion for a border wall, after Vice President Mike Pence went to the Capitol to break a tie. That procedural hurdle paves the way for a future final vote in the Senate. But with a 60-vote threshold, the House-passed package stands little chance of being endorsed on the Senate side. Republicans, who will soon lose control of the House, see the spending fight as their last chance to secure funding for Trump’s long-promised border wall. Democrats have blasted the wall as unnecessary, expensive and offensive. Earlier in the week, the Senate passed a bill funding other agencies at current levels through Feb. 8. But the president said he would not sign that bill because it didn't include new wall funding. After the White House initially indicated a willingness to consider such a short-term compromise measure, Trump faced mounting pressure from immigration-focused conservatives to dig in on his demand for $5 billion to fund a border wall. The wall was, indeed, a signature campaign promise. The House then approved $5.7 billion for a border wall as part of a measure to fund the government through early February. Both sides have been busy assigning blame. While Schumer and House Speaker-designate Pelosi have already branded this outcome a ""Trump shutdown,"" the president tweeted Friday that ""it will be a Democrat Shutdown!"" if they don’t support border wall funding. Congress may have time to work out a deal before really affecting some workers: Because the partial government shutdown comes during the Christmas break, some government workers weren’t planning to work over the next four days anyway. According to a precedent set during the Reagan administration, federal workers can be exempt from furloughs if their jobs are related to national security or if they perform essential activities that “protect life and property.” The Cabinet-level departments closing are Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, State, Transportation and Treasury. But essential personnel are still required to work without pay. Nearly 90 percent of the Homeland Security staff is deemed essential. The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) will remain open as usual during a partial government shutdown because it is “an independent entity that is funded through the sale of our products and services, and not by tax dollars,” a spokesman told Fox News. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents, air traffic controllers and border security agents would also be required to work through a shutdown – though they might not get a paycheck right away. Amtrak, a government-owned corporation, will also continue with normal operations during a short-term shutdown, a spokeswoman confirmed to Fox News.

Dem's plan to put Obama's name on Chicago's Dan Ryan Expressway irks Ryan's descendants	"Former President Barack Obama may get a famous stretch of highway named for him, if a Chicago mayoral candidate -- who once worked for Obama -- gets his way. But the descendants of the late Dan Ryan, for whom the city expressway is named, are not happy about the idea. Democratic candidate Bill Daley, who was Obama's White House chief of staff in 2011, proposed Friday that the Dan Ryan Expressway on Chicago's South Side be renamed for America's 44th president, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. “Barack Obama is from Chicago. He owns a home here. This is where the Obama library is based,” Daley said in a statement. “I’d like to see the legislature act on this early next year.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A section of Interstate 55, leading in the direction of Springfield, the Illinois state capital, was already named for Obama last year, the report said. But Daley wants an additional roadway honor for the former president. “Renaming the highway for President Obama will be a daily reminder for all of us that America’s first African-American president was shaped by Chicago,” Daley said. “We were part of history.” History may also play a part Daley's decision to run for mayor. Daley's father was former Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley, who served as the 38th mayor of the city for 21 years from 1955 to 1976. Later, the current candidate's brother, Richard M. Daley, served as mayor for 22 years, from 1989 to 2011. Democratic state Rep. La Shawn Ford of Chicago, who is also running for mayor and led part of the already passed legislation for I-55 to be named after Obama, said Daley's proposal was a ""political stunt"" and a ""ploy to try to cater to black voters,"" according to the Sun-Times. The Dan Ryan Expressway opened in 1961, not long after the death of its namesake, a longtime Cook County commissioner who worked to advance road projects in the city. Ryan's descendants, including grandson Dan Ryan III, were upset by Daley's idea, according to the Chicago Tribune. “It was a very great honor for our family to have that name,” Ryan III told the paper. “And I can’t imagine why anyone would want to change part of his own father’s legacy to begin with, but also take away an honor from one person to honor another person.” LOS ANGELES STREET TO BE RENAMED AFTER OBAMA Meanwhile, the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) expressed concern about potentially having a second stretch of road named for Obama. “As a general policy, IDOT discourages naming two roads near one another for the same person because it causes confusion for motorists,” IDOT spokeswoman Jessie Decker told the Sun-Times. “We are not aware of any existing resolutions or dedications being rescinded in order to rename a road.” The Dan Ryan Expressway was chosen for the proposed Obama honor because of its association with racial segregation in the 1960s. It was also the location for a large anti-violence protest over the summer. Thousands of protesters shut down lanes on the highway as part of a movement to increase pressure on public officials to address the gun violence that has claimed hundreds of lives in the city."	nonTerrorism	Politics
"Government headed for partial shutdown at midnight, as lawmakers leave Capitol without deal"	"A partial shutdown of the federal government appeared inevitable late Friday, as lawmakers left the Capitol without a deal to fund the government by a midnight deadline. The House adjourned Friday without a deal on spending. The Senate adjourned shortly thereafter and was not scheduled to return until noon Saturday. One early reaction came from Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., who said in a statement ahead of the midnight deadline: “A government shutdown is unacceptable. It’s a lack of leadership from President Trump and Republican Congressional Leaders. The American people expect their government to work for them and listen. It’s the holiday season, we should be showing America our better selves not driving the nation into a pointless shutdown.” The Senate had been scrambling to take up a spending package with billions in funding for a border wall, amid ongoing negotiations to fund the government by midnight; President Trump acknowledged there was a “good chance” a partial government shutdown would be triggered. After keeping the vote open for five hours to secure enough support, the Senate on Friday evening finally advanced a House-approved spending bill with $5.7 billion for a border wall, after Vice President Mike Pence went to the Capitol to break a tie. That procedural hurdle paved the way for a final vote in the Senate. But the vote didn't occur before adjournment. Behind the scenes, negotiations were ongoing into the evening, with Pence meeting with Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer on Capitol Hill, along with White House aides Mick Mulvaney and Jared Kushner. Sources tell Fox News that negotiations are taking place to secure some new money for border security. The House on Thursday approved $5.7 billion for a border wall as part of a measure to fund the government through early February. But Democrats said they wouldn't support a bill with border wall money. “President Trump: you will not get your wall,” Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the Senate floor. “Abandon your shutdown strategy. You're not getting the wall today, next week or on Jan. 3, when Democrats take control of the House.” The president – who says a spending package must include new funding for border security -- told reporters Friday he hoped there wouldn't be a shutdown but he was prepared to ride one out if it came to pass. He also tweeted a photo of a proposed ""steel slat barrier"" that could be used on the border. ""Now it's up to the Democrats as to whether or not we have a shutdown tonight,"" Trump said. Trump tweeted that he canceled plans to travel to Florida on Friday while he waited ""to see if the Democrats will help us to protect America’s Southern Border!"" Earlier, the president hailed the House vote as a big victory – one that GOP leaders scrambled to achieve when the president abruptly backed off tacit support for an earlier Senate-approved stopgap that did not include the wall money. Earlier in the day, the president publicly urged McConnell to deploy the so-called “nuclear option” to jam through the spending package, which refers to changing Senate precedent so legislation could be approved with a 51-vote majority, instead of the usual 60. But McConnell’s office made clear the majority leader would not do that, and several Republican senators said they also opposed it. Trump backed the “nuclear option” after Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., and others called for it. Absent a sudden compromise or an even more unlikely filibuster change, funding for nine of 15 Cabinet-level departments and dozens of agencies were due to lapse at midnight, resulting in a partial shutdown just as the Christmas break begins. Both sides were busy assigning blame Friday morning, in anticipation of that scenario. While Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi have already branded this outcome a Trump shutdown, the president tweeted Friday that ""it will be a Democrat Shutdown!"" if they don't support the measure before them in the Senate.

Supreme Court rejects Trump bid to enforce asylum crackdown	"The Supreme Court on Friday blocked the Trump administration from immediately enforcing a strict new asylum policy, in a 5-4 decision that marks the second legal setback this week for efforts to tighten immigration rules. The court, in a brief written order, denied a bid to begin enforcing an asylum ban for any immigrants who illegally cross the U.S.-Mexico border. The decision leaves in place lower-court rulings that blocked the administration from automatically denying asylum to people who do not go through official border crossings. An open-ended nationwide injunction on enforcement issued by a San Francisco-based federal judge this week prompted the Justice Department to seek immediate relief from the Supreme Court. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Chief Justice John Roberts provided the critical vote against the administration Friday, siding with the four liberal justices. Newly confirmed Justice Brett Kavanaugh and three other conservatives on the bench sided with the administration, the order said. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, despite having surgery in New York on Friday to remove cancerous nodules in her lung, apparently voted with the majority, avoiding a 4-4 tie. The current legal challenge originated in California, where the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also recently ruled against the administration and said the policy was likely “inconsistent” with existing law. Trump has said he was acting in response to caravans of migrants making their way to the border. The Supreme Court order comes after a federal judge in a separate case took the extraordinary step this week of ordering that asylum seekers who sued after their deportation be returned to the U.S. to have their claims heard anew. U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, in doing so, blocked policies that could prevent immigrants who claim to have suffered gang violence or domestic abuse in their home countries from seeking asylum. The White House said in response that Wednesday’s ruling “will further overwhelm our immigration courts with meritless cases, making the existing massive backlog even worse.” Despite setbacks in the courts, the administration is moving forward with other changes. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced Thursday that the U.S. has secured an agreement with Mexico so that immigrants claiming asylum will be returned to Mexico as their cases are processed -- a bid to end the practice known as “catch-and-release.” Nielsen made the announcement at a House Judiciary Committee hearing, telling the committee that the goal is to crack down on migrants falsely claiming asylum, only to be released into the U.S. and escape the radar of immigration officials. “But by the time the courts have issued their orders, most of these illegal aliens have vanished within our country for good,” she said. “They have escaped the law, undermined the system, and made it harder for us to actually help real asylum-seekers by flooding the system with false claims.” Fox News’ Adam Shaw and The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Politics
Trump tweets image of proposed border wall: ‘totally effective while at the same time beautiful!’	"In the midst of a contentious fight with Democrats over a possible partial government shutdown and funding for border security, President Trump on Friday tweeted an image of the proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. “A design of our Steel Slat Barrier which is totally effective while at the same time beautiful!” the president wrote in a caption for an image of what appeared to be a tall steel picket-designed fence. The tweet from Trump came amid a debate over government funding. The Senate has been scrambling to take up a spending package with billions in funding for a border wall, as Trump made clear there is a “good chance” of a partial government shutdown at midnight. It wasn't immediately clear how much money would be allocated for border security. “The Democrats, are saying loud and clear that they do not want to build a Concrete Wall - but we are not building a Concrete Wall, we are building artistically designed steel slats, so that you can easily see through it,” Trump tweeted earlier this week. “It will be beautiful and, at the same time, give our Country the security that our citizens deserve,” he continued. “It will go up fast and save us BILLIONS of dollars a month once completed!” Trump had demanded $5 billion in funding for the wall. Democrats returned with a $1.3 billion counteroffer – with the condition it was for fencing and not a wall.

"California Dems flex new supermajority, with plans to pursue gun tax and more"	"The blue wave that swept through California in the midterm elections gave Democrats a supermajority in both chambers of the state legislature -- which means virtually free rein to pursue boundary-pushing liberal policies in the new year. The state that popularized plastic straw bans and played a critical role in the push for ""sanctuary"" policies protecting undocumented immigrants may just be getting started. Having tightened their grip on power in Sacramento, Democrats are on pace to hold 29 of the 40 seats in the state Senate and 60 of 80 in the state Assembly. With a Democratic governor-elect, Gavin Newsom, the veto-proof majorities in the legislature might not be critical on most issues. But they could help ensure passage of any items Newsom might otherwise resist. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Lawmakers already are pushing a number of proposals ahead of the new session in January.  From tighter gun controls to affordable public housing measures, Democrats are readying a raft of bills that would face no meaningful opposition from a depleted Republican minority, provided the party stays united. “Republicans are politically less relevant in California than they have been in years and it is really up to the Democrats to decide what role they play,” Zev Yaroslavsky, the director of the Los Angeles Initiative at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs, told Fox News. “But as long as Democrats stay unified, they won’t even need bipartisan support.” One of the pieces of legislation Democrats are looking to quickly pass is Assembly Bill 18, which among other things looks to tax the sale of handguns and semiautomatic weapons in order to generate funding for gun control programs. The bill, which was sponsored by Democratic Assemblyman Marc Levine, would implement “an excise tax on the sales of handguns and semiautomatic rifles” and then hand over the resulting revenue to the California Violence Intervention and Prevention Grant Program (CalVIP). “California needs to bolster violence prevention initiatives so that they are commensurate with our state’s tough gun laws and as effective as violence prevention programs of other states,” Levine said in a statement earlier this month. California already has some of the toughest gun control laws in the country and, beginning in 2019, state ammunition dealers will be required to maintain logs of all sales – including those of bullets. The state has already restricted online sales of bullets so they can only be delivered to licensed dealers and not someone’s home. The gun-tax legislation has drawn heavy criticism from gun-rights and hunting groups. “While the legislation lacks details of how the actual proposal will look, it expresses the intent to place an additional tax on handguns and semi-automatic firearms for distribution to various community-based intervention and prevention programs,” the National Rifle Association’s Institute for Legislative Action stated on its website. “Once again, lawmakers are saddling lawful gun owners with additional taxes and fees for the misdeeds of criminals.” Along with guns, California Democrats are also looking to crack down on the rise of vaping, or e-cigarette use, among teens. In November, six state senators led by Democrat Jerry Hill introduced a law to ban store sales of flavored electronic cigarettes and other flavored tobacco products. ""We must stop the appalling epidemic of e-cigarette use by youths,"" Hill said in a statement. ""Enticed by fruit, candy and other appealing flavors, high school and middle school students throughout the U.S. are vaping in record numbers."" California’s Democratic supermajority also could take up the immigration debate anew. In early December, Assemblyman Joaquin Arambula introduced legislation that would allow undocumented immigrants over the age of 19 to enroll in Medi-Cal, the state’s low-income health care program. Around 60 percent of the remaining 3 million uninsured Californians are undocumented, and projections put the price tag for the program at around $3 billion per year. While incoming Gov. Newsom campaigned on creating a universal health care system in the state, it is unclear if he would support Arambula’s measure, which would take a big chunk of the state’s budget. Besides immigration measures, California Democrats are looking to deal with the state's mounting homelessness crisis and its problem of affordable housing. Two measures attempting to tackle the problems were recently introduced. One introduced by state Sen. Scott Wiener would create “right to shelter” for homeless individuals. “California’s housing crisis, along with our mental health and addiction challenges, are driving people into homelessness, and we must act,” Wiener said. “We must do more to ensure homeless people have access to shelter, as a way to stabilize people’s lives and help them transition to permanent housing.” Wiener also introduced legislation to give the state more power over land-use decisions and allow developers to bypass local low-density zoning restrictions and build apartment buildings within a half- or quarter-mile of public transit and close to job centers. While both pieces of legislation are meant to curb homelessness and ease the state’s housing crisis, Republicans and some analysts caution that they could also drain the state’s coffers ahead of a possible economic recession and put Newsom in a tough spot during his first term. “Hopefully there are enough adults in the legislature to enforce some fiscal discipline,” Yaroslavsky said. “If the state goes broke, it cancels out any of the good that a program can do and the legislature won’t get blamed, it’ll be Newsom.” Outgoing Gov. Jerry Brown, though, cautioned against presuming the supermajority will have a huge impact. He argued that many Democrats who won were more conservative-leaning, making a two-thirds vote difficult to cobble together on most issues. “I think the chances of getting the Legislature to vote by two-thirds on new taxes are very, very limited and unlikely,” Brown said, according to The Sacramento Bee."	nonTerrorism	Politics
 Trump signs criminal justice reform bill	"President Trump on Friday signed a sweeping criminal justice reform bill, marking a major legislative victory on an issue that garnered bipartisan support despite deep partisan gridlock on everything from immigration to health care. “We have everybody wanting this,” Trump said before signing the bill, touting the “cross-section” of different interests that lined up behind the legislation. The bipartisan moment was all the more noteworthy considering Trump's ongoing clash with Congress over border-wall funding, which he insists should be included in a broader government spending package. Without an elusive deal, a funding lapse will trigger a partial government shutdown at midnight. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But on the sidelines of that fight, the House overwhelmingly approved the criminal justice bill Thursday on a 358-36 vote, after the Senate passed it 87-12. The decisive passage marks a win for Trump as well as his senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who advocated for the bill in the face of some conservative resistance. The First Step Act would give federal judges more leeway when sentencing some drug offenders and boost prisoner rehabilitation efforts. It also would reduce life sentences for some drug offenders with three convictions, or ""three strikes,"" to 25 years. Another provision would allow about 2,600 federal prisoners sentenced for crack cocaine offenses before August 2010 the opportunity to petition for a reduced penalty. It also incentivizes prisoners to participate in programs designed to reduce the risk of recidivism, with the reward being an earlier release to either home confinement or a halfway house to complete their sentence. This will not be made available to offenders who were also convicted of violent firearms offenses, sexual exploitation of children or high-level heroin and fentanyl dealing. The changes were aimed at addressing concerns that the nation's war on drugs has exploded the prison population without helping people prepare for their return to society. Prisoners also could get seven days of credit for good behavior each year of his or her sentence with this bill – with the credits being deducted from the sentence to allow for early release. The bill also expands eligibility for elderly or terminally ill prisoners to secure compassionate release. After the bill passed, Trump tweeted his congratulations and described it as a ""great bi-partisan achievement for everybody."" Passing the Senate, it had picked up the support of hardened anti-Trump Democrats, including Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. -- who heralded the bill as a start to righting the country’s “broken” criminal justice system. “But for the first time in a long time, with the passage of this bill into law, our country will make a meaningful break from the decades of failed policies that led to mass incarceration, which has cost taxpayers billions of dollars, drained our economy, compromised public safety, hurt our children and disproportionately harmed communities of color while devaluing the very idea of justice in America,” Booker said. While the bill passed both chambers comfortably, it had seen some passionate resistance from conservatives, led by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who introduced amendments including one that would require victims be notified before a prisoner was released early. He had previously dubbed the bill a ""jailbreak"" over fears that it would release violent offenders onto the streets early. But an array of liberal and conservative advocacy groups also rallied in support of the bill. The Koch-backed group, Americans for Prosperity, applauded senators for putting ""policy ahead of politics."" The American Civil Liberties Union said the bill was ""by no means perfect. But we are in the midst of a mass incarceration crisis, and the time to act is now.""

Here’s what $5 billion in border wall funding would buy	"As Congress battles over President Trump’s demand for $5 billion in border-wall funding, Homeland Security officials explained Friday what that money could actually buy. According to DHS officials, the funding would cover the construction of 215 miles of “wall system” on the southern border. What that system would include is a matter of debate. But DHS officials say it could cover the replacement of “dilapidated” fencing, new wall sections and secondary wall structures, as well as roads and lights for Border Patrol agents. The “wall system” also includes sensor technology that would enable agents to detect movement coming toward the wall, “starting the clock” for officials to respond before anyone starts to try to scale it. DHS officials said that of the 215 “linear miles,” well over a hundred miles would be brand new wall in places where there is no barrier now. The majority of this construction would be in the Rio Grande area, specifically the Laredo sector, along the Texas border with Mexico. DHS officials said those 215 miles would be the most “critical” locations that need to be addressed. The total cost of a wall could be upwards of $25 billion – additional funding in the future could go toward other locations. Despite these plans, Republicans are still struggling to approve Trump’s wall-funding request. House Republicans passed a government-spending package late Thursday that includes the $5 billion, but it is running into Democratic opposition in the Senate. “You will not get your wall. Abandon your shutdown strategy,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Friday, in remarks directed at Trump. Without a deal, a funding lapse would trigger a partial government shutdown at midnight."	nonTerrorism	Politics
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has cancerous growths removed from lung	" Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg underwent lung surgery in New York City on Friday to remove cancerous growths, the court said in a news release. The release said Ginsburg underwent a pulmonary lobectomy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center after two nodules in the lower lobe of her left lung were discovered. The discovery came incidentally during tests after she fractured several ribs during a fall in November. The news release said both nodules removed during surgery were found to be malignant, but scans performed before surgery indicated no evidence of disease elsewhere in the body. No further treatment is planned. “Justice Ginsburg is resting comfortably and is expected to remain in the hospital for a few days,” the court said. Ginsburg, 85, has survived a series of health scares. She also broke two ribs in a fall in 2012, has had two prior bouts with cancer and had a stent implanted to open a blocked artery in 2014. Despite the issues, Ginsburg has yet to miss a single day of oral arguments during her tenure, The Washington Post reported. The liberal justice, who studied at Harvard Law School, was nominated to the highest court in the land by former President Bill Clinton in 1993 to replace retiring Justice Byron R. White. Ginsburg was Clinton's first Supreme Court pick. Prior to ascending to the Supreme Court, Ginsburg became the first woman to receive tenure at Columbia University Law School. She is also notably the co-founder of the American Civil Liberties Union's Women's Rights Project. Ginsburg is the court's oldest member and there's been a great deal of speculation on when she may retire. However, she reportedly hired clerks for the term that extends into 2020, indicating she has no plans to leave soon.

 Behind the scenes of the Mattis bombshell: More resignations expected after ‘protest’ exit	"Defense Secretary Jim Mattis’ resignation, which shocked Washington’s national security establishment and rattled America’s allies, was sealed in a fateful 18-hour period that saw President Trump resolve to withdraw troops from Syria – alarming Pentagon officials who see America’s role in the region as crucial. For Mattis, the president’s order was the final straw, Fox News is told. “Make no mistake – Jim Mattis is resigning in protest over the president's national security policies,” a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News. Fox News is told more resignations at the Pentagon could be coming in Mattis’ wake. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump has stood by his Syria decision, telling detractors that the pullout should come as “no surprise” given his 2016 campaign promises and arguing that America’s role as “Policeman of the Middle East” is not worth the sacrifice. But Mattis could not abide the call. Fox News has learned new details of the final moments that led the hardened Pentagon leader to march his resignation letter to the White House, setting off speculation – and bipartisan concern – about the direction Trump’s foreign policy will take in the new year, especially with John Kelly leaving as White House chief of staff. In one telling detail, it appears Mattis’ resignation letter had already been written when he went to the White House at around 3 p.m. on Thursday with the notice in hand. Fifty copies of his resignation letter already had been printed and were in a folder in his office to be distributed upon his return. Before leaving for the White House, Mattis watched the president's video explaining his decision to pull out of Syria. In the video, Trump declared, “We have won against ISIS … and now it’s time for our troops to come back home.” Trump then pointed to the sky and suggested he was doing this for the troops who had died. Mattis spent 45 minutes with the president, Fox News is told, and did not try to change the president’s mind on Syria, despite some reports to the contrary. According to those familiar with the secretary's decision, it was a resignation based on principle. It would mark the first time in 40 years that a Cabinet official has resigned over a policy difference. The last person to do so was then-President Jimmy Carter's Secretary of State Cyrus Vance during the failed Iran hostage rescue. The Pentagon leader’s resignation letter, in diplomatic but unmistakable terms, also made clear that he was leaving the administration over policy disagreements and not job fatigue. ""Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position,"" Mattis wrote. Mattis wrote that he has ""been privileged to serve"" in his role as defense secretary. Fox News is told that Mattis believes pulling out of Syria is a betrayal to the Kurds and the Syrian Democratic Forces – U.S. allies whom military leaders believe will be slaughtered once the U.S. leaves Syria. In Washington, what comes next may be another seminal debate that will define the principles of the Republican Party for years to come. Trump already has altered the party core on issues like trade and entitlements. In his military drawdown effort, Trump has found allies in lawmakers like Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who adamantly oppose U.S. intervention overseas. But for now, they are overwhelmed by hawkish Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham who consider such pullouts a grave and strategic mistake. The Syria pullout was coupled with news that the Pentagon is being told to consider withdrawing up to 7,000 troops from Afghanistan – or half the U.S. presence – against the advice of senior military leaders. “If we continue on our present course we are setting in motion the loss of all our gains and paving the way toward a second 9/11,” Graham said, regarding Afghanistan. Earlier this month, Mattis was asked by Fox News’ Bret Baier at the Reagan National Defense Forum whether he was being pressured to pull out of Afghanistan. Mattis warned of the consequences of doing so: “If we leave, 20-odd of the most dangerous terrorist groups in the world centered in that region, and we walk out of there, then we know what will happen. Our intelligence services are very specific that we will be under attack in a number of years.” As for what precipitated Trump’s decision, Fox News first reported that Trump agreed to a pullout during a call last week with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders stressed that Trump and the outgoing defense secretary have a “good relationship” even though they sometimes disagree. “The president always listens to the members of his national security team but at the end of the day it's the president's decision to make,” she said. Another factor was also at play in Mattis’ decision, Fox News is told. One source said Mattis had campaigned for Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein to replace outgoing Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Joe Dunford. Trump, however, went with Army Chief of Staff Mark Milley, which came as a blow to Mattis."	nonTerrorism	Politics
Republican handling of budget battle ‘political malpractice’: A.B. Stoddard	"Allowing a partial government shutdown over border-wall funding would be a grave mistake, RealClearPolitics associate editor A.B. Stoddard argued on the Fox News “Special Report” All-Star Panel Thursday. Congress faces a Friday-at-midnight deadline to pass a spending package, but the parties remain at odds after the House passed a measure containing $5.7 billion for a border wall – something Senate Democrats say they won’t support. Stoddard, along with Washington Examiner chief political correspondent Byron York and Washington Free Beacon editor in chief Matthew Continetti, weighed in on the budget battle on Fox News Thursday evening. CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE FULL EPISODE When asked about the logistics of how the Congress might pass a budget through both chambers that includes border funding, Stoddard offered a grim forecast -- since Vice President Pence already told senators that they could “go home” after the chamber on Wednesday approved an earlier stopgap measure that did not include the wall funding. “A congressman, who is close to leadership and knows what’s going on, told me … that they don’t know what’s going on, they weren’t certain that they’d have the votes, and they were hoping that even if it failed, the president would come to his senses. There wasn’t a Senate plan, there was a ‘President Trump comes to his senses’ plan,” Stoddard said. “I think the nation’s fourth-graders know this is no way to run a lemonade stand. This is completely irresponsible. The markets are rattling on the prospect of a shutdown that’s turning on Ann Coulter’s tweets.” Coulter was among the conservatives who urged Trump to fight for border-wall funding. Stoddard alleged that prominent House Republicans like Rep. Mark Meadows R-N.C., and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio – who also urged Trump to fight – are guilty of “political malpractice.” York noted that there were many stories that Trump was “caving” amid the outcry from prominent conservatives like Rush Limbaugh and Coulter. He also told the panel that House Republicans were “affected” by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer’s predictions that Trump didn’t have the votes in the House for a budget that included funding for the border wall. House Republicans proved Thursday night they did have the votes. Meanwhile, Continetti told the panel that congressional Democrats seemed “more emboldened” in this budget battle since the heated exchange last week at the White House between Trump, Pelosi, and Schumer. “This has put President Trump in a very precarious political position because on the one hand, both the shutdown and the wall are unpopular with the public at large -- but when it comes to his conservative base, if Trump fails to secure money for the wall and during this, which may be his last opportunity, that means the base might rebel,” Continetti said."	nonTerrorism	Politics
"What is the 'nuclear option,' the step Trump wants the Senate to take?"	"President Trump wants to go nuclear. With a partial government shutdown imminent, Trump urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to implement the so-called ""nuclear option"" to pass a spending bill that includes the $5 billion he’s demanded for the border wall. He also praised Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., for supporting a precedent change in the Senate to get the spending bill – with his demand for border wall funding – passed. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Read on for a look at how the nuclear option could change the Senate. The nuclear option would change Senate precedent, to require only a simple majority to pass a bill as opposed to the 60-vote majority required now. With a 60-vote threshold, the House-approved spending bill that includes $5.7 billion for a border wall has a slim chance of actually making it out of the Senate. With a simple majority, just 51 senators – or 50, with Vice President Pence serving as a tiebreaker – would be needed to pass a spending bill that includes Trump’s border funding demands. TRUMP BACKS CALL TO NUKE FILIBUSTER IN DRIVE TO PASS BORDER WALL $$ AS SHUTDOWN LOOMS Trump has often implored the Senate to use the nuclear option to get immigration legislation passed since he’s been in the White House. “Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release. Getting more dangerous. ‘Caravans’ coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW,” he tweeted in April. McConnell has repeatedly said he would not go this route on legislation. Such a drastic change would likely struggle to pick up enough support – even among Senate Republicans. Senate Republicans used the nuclear option in 2017 to overcome a Democratic filibuster and confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. It was former Senate majority leader Harry Reid who first used the nuclear option in 2013 when he lowered the threshold of votes needed for nominees for federal court and other top positions."	nonTerrorism	Politics
"Arizona lawmaker arrested for DUI, reportedly tells officer, 'You'll get yours'"	"When an Arizona lawmaker was arrested for allegedly driving while under the influence earlier this week, he reportedly told an officer, “You’ll get yours.” State Rep. David Cook, a Republican, was arrested Wednesday night in Mesa with a blood-alcohol content registering 0.158 percent, almost twice the legal limit, according to The Arizona Republic. He was arrested on suspicion of extreme DUI. After he was pulled over, Cook told an officer, “Do you know what you’re doing, son? You’re making a mistake,” according to a Department of Public Safety (DPS) report. He also said it was “fine” when he was told his license would be suspended because his wife works for the state’s Motor Vehicle Department, the report stated. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “I’m fine, don’t worry, you’ll get yours,” Cook told an officer, according to the DPS report. Cook apologized for the incident in a Facebook post – although he did not mention the comments he allegedly made to law enforcement. “No lunch, no dinner, and some drinks with friends sounds harmless enough, but get behind the wheel and try to drive home and you’re taking a chance you just shouldn’t take,” Cook said. “I’m lucky, because I got pulled over and got a DUI, but there was no accident, no one got hurt, etc. I’ll be paying a real price for it, and it’s a humiliating experience for sure, but compared to what can happen when someone drinks and drives, the good Lord was looking out for me.” NEW MEXICO LAWMAKER PLEADS WITH POLICE, SAYS ‘I LITERALLY FIGHT FOR YOU GUYS’ DURING DWI ARREST He said the law enforcement officers “behaved professionally and did their job well.” “I apologize to all of you because I hold myself to a higher standard and I’ve let everyone down, friends and family alike,” Cook said. Cook has been a member of the state legislature since 2017 and chairs the county infrastructure committee. His district encompasses parts of Pinal and Gila Counties. Arizona state House-Speaker-elect Rusty Bowers said he will reveal what disciplinary actions Cook will face in the legislature once he’s had more time to review the incident and speak with other members, according to KSAZ-TV. “I’m disappointed and saddened by Representative Cook for failing to meet the standard expected of all Arizonans, much less an elected official,” Bowers said."	nonTerrorism	Politics
" Trump backs call to nuke filibuster in drive to pass border wall $$, as shutdown looms"	"President Trump on Friday publicly urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to deploy the so-called “nuclear option” to jam through a controversial spending package that includes billions in border-wall funds, as Washington’s warring parties remain on a collision course toward a partial government shutdown at midnight. “Mitch, use the Nuclear Option and get it done! Our Country is counting on you!” the president tweeted, referring to congressional slang for overhauling the Senate filibuster so legislation can pass with just 51 votes, as opposed to the usual 60. The president prodded McConnell to shatter Senate precedent after the House approved $5.7 billion for a border wall as part of a measure to fund the government through early February. Trump hailed the 217-185 vote as a big victory – one that GOP leaders scrambled to cobble together when the president abruptly backed off tacit support for an earlier Senate-approved stopgap that did not include the wall money. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP With a 60-vote threshold, however, the House-passed package stands little chance of being endorsed on the Senate side. Trump backed the “nuclear option” after Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., and others called for it. “House just passed a bill that fully funds government and enables @realDonaldTrump to secure our border/build the wall. Senate can do same by eliminating the filibuster. 51 votes, same as we do for judges!” Daines tweeted. Trump, who was meeting with Senate Republicans late Friday morning, afterward said Daines has his ""total support"" in that effort. McConnell, however, repeatedly has said he would not go this route on legislation. Such a drastic change would likely struggle to pick up enough support even among Senate Republicans, though the chamber has been steadily eroding filibuster precedent to ease the path for the confirmation of presidential nominees dating back to the Obama administration. A McConnell aide noted Friday that he ""has said for years that the votes are not there in the Conference to use the nuclear option."" Other senators seemed to back McConnell on that point. Moments before Trump's tweet, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders made clear on ""Fox & Friends"" that the administration supported the nuclear option calls. “They should [lower the threshold]. This is such an important issue and it’s something that all of America wants to see happen,"" she said, calling for the Senate to do “whatever is necessary to get the job done."" The end-game remains unclear. Just two days ago, Trump seemed resigned to backing a stopgap spending package without his sought-after wall money, for the sake of avoiding a partial shutdown after Friday's midnight deadline. But after a backlash from conservatives worried the president's wall promise would effectively crumble once Democrats take the House next month, Trump reversed course to insist on the funding -- resulting in Thursday's House vote. Yet Senate Democrats are in no mood to go along with the House Republican package. ""The Trump temper tantrum may produce a government shutdown. It will not get him his wall,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said. Absent a sudden compromise or an even more unlikely filibuster change, funding for nine of 15 Cabinet-level departments and dozens of agencies could lapse at midnight, resulting in a partial shutdown just as the Christmas break begins. Both sides were busy assigning blaming Friday morning, in anticipation of that scenario. While Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi have already branded this outcome a Trump shutdown, the president tweeted Friday that ""it will be a Democrat Shutdown!"" if they don't support the measure before them in the Senate. ""No matter what happens today in the Senate, Republican House Members should be very proud of themselves. They flew back to Washington from all parts of the World in order to vote for Border Security and the Wall. Not one Democrat voted yes, and we won big. I am very proud of you!"" he tweeted. ""The Democrats, whose votes we need in the Senate, will probably vote against Border Security and the Wall even though they know it is DESPERATELY NEEDED. If the Dems vote no, there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time. People don’t want Open Borders and Crime!"""	nonTerrorism	Politics
" Dem Rep. Gutierrez berates Kirstjen Nielsen for 6 minutes, leaves room when she tries to respond"	"Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., berated Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen for six minutes at a Judiciary Committee hearing Thursday over Trump administration policies, before promptly leaving when she started to respond to his charges. Nielsen appeared in front of the committee where she announced a new policy requiring migrants seeking asylum to return to Mexico as their claims are processed. Gutierrez, a fierce critic of the White House's border policies, made a blistering speech during his allotted time. ""The majority on this committee must think you're doing a fantastic job because they've ordered this hearing so you could come before us and look tough and remorseless just in time for the holidays. The remorseless secretary during the holidays,"" he said. Gutierrez mocked the questions surrounding Nielsen's job security and said the Trump administration did one thing better than any other: lie. ""I suspect that if you still have our job, which seems to always be a big question, in three weeks, we'll see if you have the same sympathetic questions when you come back,"" he said. Gutierrez recounted President Donald Trump attacking Mexicans in his speech announcing his run for president and his claim Mexico would pay for a southern border wall. Gutierrez, who drew criticism in January when he referred to ex-Homeland Security chief Gen. John Kelly as a ""disgrace to the uniform,"" blasted him and Nielsen for their border policies and rhetoric, which he said harmed people like his own parents.

"Trump's frontrunners for Pentagon job likely to share Mattis' views on Syria, Afghanistan"	"Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said President Trump deserves a Pentagon leader “whose views are better aligned” with the commander-in-chief's, but a search for such a person will be a lot harder after Trump’s decisions on Syria and Afghanistan. Mattis' resignation Thursday, which will take effect in February, came shortly after Trump announced that the U.S. military will withdraw from Syria and pull back from Afghanistan. While Mattis’ departure was considered imminent amid his opposition to the Army staff changes Trump was considering, the Syria decision ultimately pushed him to quit after he failed to convince the president to reconsider the move. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A source close to the president told Fox News that Gen. Jack Keane and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., are considered the frontrunners to replace Mattis. But neither candidate seems likely to embrace Trump’s “America First” foreign policy: Both came out against the withdrawal from Syria in strong terms. Trump's appointment of either of them could pave the way toward a repeat of the same policy disagreements the president had with Mattis. Keane, a retired four-star Army general -- who’s also a former Army vice chief of staff -- has been suggested as a possible replacement for Mattis, even though he recently said he doesn’t “intend to go back into public service.” His name was mentioned in October after Trump’s ""60 Minutes"" interview in which the president said Mattis was “sort of a Democrat” who may “leave soon.” For Trump to nominate Keane, however, he would have to swallow Keane’s hawkish stance on international affairs and his recent criticism of the move to pull out of Syria, which the retired general called a “huge strategic mistake."" “Clearly, we're repeating the Obama mistake of premature withdrawal, which got us ISIS,” Keane said on Fox News’ “America's Newsroom” on Thursday. “In my judgment, we need to stick to it and finish the job,” Keane added, noting that the withdrawal of American troops will give “a victory of strategic proportions” to the Iranian regime. Keane is likely to diverge from Trump’s decision that some American troops should be pulled from Afghanistan. Last year, after the Trump administration announced the increase in troops in Afghanistan, Keane told Fox News that there needs to be between 10,000 to 20,000 additional troops in the country to win the war. “There's no doubt the 4,000 will be helpful,” he said of the additional troops. “But the real question is: Will it change the momentum of the war to our favor? My judgment is it’s likely not to.” Keane also voiced his opposition to Trump’s plans to trim the planned defense budget, saying it was a mistake. He went on to slam Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s acting White House chief of staff, saying he’s “a fox in the chicken coop,” according to Politico. Meanwhile, Cotton, who was previously considered for defense secretary or CIA director, is also on the White House radar to replace Mattis. Yet just like Keane, Cotton is more aligned with the hawks of the defense establishment and has urged Trump to reconsider the Syria move. He co-signed a letter with other Republican colleagues, including U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, stating their opposition to Trump’s decision. Graham’s opposition was singled out by Trump on Thursday: The president claimed the senator was against “saving soldier lives & billions of $$$.” In many ways, Cotton is also more interventionist than Mattis and openly suggested potentially using military force or covert action to remove the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. Cotton also warned earlier this summer that a premature withdrawal from Afghanistan could lead to negative effects on U.S. national security and to a resurgence of terrorist groups in the country. “I wish that you and all of those other lieutenants and captains who said in 2001 that they were there -- so their kids wouldn’t have to be -- could have had that prediction come true. But it’s simply not the case,” Cotton said during a hearing concerning the next head of the NATO mission in Afghanistan. “The enemy is still there,"" he added. ""And the enemy still gets a vote.""

"Illegal immigrant's murderous spree shows California must scrap 'sanctuary' law, GOP lawmaker says"	"A California state assemblyman is demanding a change to a ""state sanctuary"" law that prohibits local law enforcement agencies from cooperating with federal immigration officials after cops said a twice-deported man living in the United States illegally went on a daylong crime spree that included a murder. Assemblyman Jim Patterson, R-Fresno, believes Senate Bill 54 -- known as the California Values Act -- needs fixing to allow local law enforcement agencies to recognize detainer requests from federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel, FOX 26 in Fresno reported. “When those who say [Bill] 54 makes accommodation for that, they're really not saying it like it is,” Patterson, a former mayor of Fresno, told the station. “It's conflicting, it's confusing and it essentially says you can't talk to ICE on those misdemeanors."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Patterson’s comments come after Gustavo Garcia, 36, of Visalia, allegedly went on a daylong “reign of terror” Monday before dying in a police chase. Tulare County Sheriff Mike Boudreaux said Garcia was in police custody days before the rampage and would have been handed over to ICE agents, if not for California's sanctuary law. SANCTUARY CITIES: WHAT ARE THEY? ""We are very frustrated with the fact that the way the laws are set up currently that law enforcement hands are tied,” Boudreaux said Wednesday. Authorities said Garcia's crime spree included robbing a convenience store, shooting several people, including killing one person, and firing at buildings before crashing a truck that he had stolen. Senate Bill 54 was enacted in September last year by state Democrats on a party-line vote. It was drafted on the premise that undocumented immigrants would feel safer going to the police to report crimes and aid in investigations if they didn’t fear the risk of detention. CALIFORNIA COPS 'FRUSTRATED' WITH SANCTUARY LAWS STOPPING THEM FROM WORKING WITH ICE OVER TWICE-DEPORTED CRIMINAL Patterson wants the bill’s language rewritten with the help of Democrats, who control the state Legislature. ""This could be fixed but it has to take a will and I don't know if the ruling party has that will,"" he said. ""What the bill language does it simply closes the communication gap so that sheriffs can ask of ICE the kinds of questions that need to be answered."" Though some law enforcement officials favor cooperating with ICE, some are not on board. Alex Villanueva, head of the nation’s largest sheriff’s department in Los Angeles County, told county officials Tuesday that eliminated the presence of immigration officials from county jails and plans to limit the crimes that lead jail authorities to cooperate with ICE. “We are going to physically remove ICE from the county jails,"" Villanueva told the county Board of Supervisors."	nonTerrorism	Politics
"California Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom will put wineries, hotels in blind trust"	"California Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom will place his collection of wineries, hotels, restaurants and other holdings into a blind trust, he announced Thursday. Newsom, who takes office Jan. 7 and has made millions from his investments, also promised to disclose his personal and business holdings each year in addition to this tax returns, the Sacramento Bee reported. His array of hospitality businesses, known as the PlumpJack group, grew out of a wine shop he owned in San Francisco in 1992, the Los Angeles Times reported. Newsom, 51, is a former mayor of San Francisco, having held that office from 2004 to 2011. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “Governor-elect Gavin Newsom is announcing today that he will be the first governor in the history of California to release his tax returns every year, just as he has done as a candidate,” Newsom’s spokesman Nathan Click said in a statement. “Newsom will also disclose his personal and business holdings each year on his statement of economic interest and separate himself from the PlumpJack Group wine and hospitality businesses that he has built.” Shyla Hendrickson, an attorney and Newsom family friend, will manage his businesses while he is governor. She will be legally barred from sharing business information with Newsom and his representatives, Click told the Bee. Newsom will also issue an executive order barring state executive branch agencies from doing business with PlumJack, according to the paper. “That’s as much as anybody could ask him to do, except for selling all the properties, which I wouldn’t recommend him doing,” Stern told the L.A. Times Thursday. Newsom's moves, perhaps deliberately, are in contrast to those of President Trump, who has refused to divest from his real estate holdings or put them into a blind trust. Trump has put his children in charge of his businesses instead. Walter Shaub, director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, has blasted Trump's decision to maintain his business empire instead of selling of his corporate assets and placing remaining profits in a blind trust. State law doesn’t require Newsom to divest from PlumpJack and he can still sign bills or take executive action that would benefit his companies if his decision would affect all Californians in the same way it would affect him."	nonTerrorism	Politics
North Carolina voter ID law faces court challenge -- immediately after GOP overrides Dem governor's veto	"Republican lawmakers in North Carolina completed an override of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s veto of a new voter ID law this week -- and immediately faced a challenge in court. Six voters described as either black or biracial residents filed the lawsuit Wednesday, mere minutes after the state House voted to override the veto 72-40. The state Senate had voted to override Tuesday, the News & Observer of Raleigh reported. Republicans have blasted Cooper, who last week had said no to the legislation even though more than 55 percent of the state’s voters had approved it in a recent referendum. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""You have betrayed the majority of the hard-working, honest people of North Carolina who put this provision into our constitution,"" Republican state Rep. Jimmy Dixon said of Cooper. ""You should hang your head in shame."" The referendum called for the state’s constitution to add an amendment requiring in-person voter photo ID, expanding the number of qualifying forms of ID and exceptions compared to legislation blocked earlier this decade. Republicans say the changes will ensure that everyone lawfully registered to vote can cast a ballot. Permitted IDs would include traditional driver's licenses and military identification, student IDs from colleges and universities, and employee ID cards for state and local governments. Those IDs must meet certain security thresholds. The voters who filed the lawsuit Wednesday said the restrictions will disproportionately and unduly burden the right to vote for African-American and American Indian residents. The suit claims the bill will add a financial cost to voting in the form of lost work hours and the need to find transportation to obtain an ID. State Democrats have said the law was meant to suppress votes. “You don’t have a right to take away my right or anybody else’s right because they can’t supply you with a photo ID,” Democratic state Rep. Mickey Michaux told the News & Observer. “It looks like history is going to repeat itself.” But Republicans rebuffed such claims, saying Democrats were responsible for slavery and Jim Crow, the paper reported. “The Republicans are the party of emancipation,” Republican state Rep. Jeff Collins said. “I get tired of getting blamed for things the Democrats have done.” The lawsuit also asks that a three-judge panel of state judges prevent the law from being enforced during the litigation. Any appeals would go to the state Supreme Court. Fox News’ Dom Calicchio and the Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Politics
 Obama to fold Organizing for Action group in effort to focus on gerrymandering reform: report	"Former President Barack Obama is going all-in on gerrymandering reform by consolidating his nonprofit political organization group with another to double down on efforts on what has become his major focus since leaving the White House. Obama announced the consolidation of his Organizing for Action group into the National Democratic Redistricting Committee during a call with supporters this week. “People want common sense gun safety laws, Congress ignores it. People want compressive immigration reform, Congress ignores it,” Obama said during the Thursday call, the Atlantic reported. “The single most important thing that could be done at the grassroots level over the next few years is to make sure the rules of the road are fair. If we do that, I think we’ll do the right thing.” CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The merger ends the six-year existence of OFA. Gerrymandering has become a hot topic in recent years. State legislatures in Wisconsin and Michigan have been heavily criticized after Republicans have moved to curtail the powers of Democrats elected in November. Republicans in those states have had advantages in winning elections due to gerrymandered voting districts, the Atlantic said. The Chicago-based OFA was formed out of Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign and was initially set up to mobilize voters to support his agenda. The group’s model is similar to that of the America First groups – a collaboration between the America First Action super PAC and a nonprofit affiliate – that support President Trump’s agenda, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. OFA was ready to close down two years ago, had Hillary Clinton won the presidency. But the election of Trump breathed new life into the group and by 2018, OFA had focused on organizing efforts for Democrats ahead of this year's midterm elections. Obama’s former Attorney General and current OFA chairman Eric Holder, called the merger “a way to maximize the incredible impact that OFA has had in the past and continue it into the future — this is a natural extension of the work we’ve been doing over the past year.” He said Obama has focused on redistricting reform as a way to jumpstart action on climate change, gun control and health care. Another Obama administration figure associated with OFA has been Valerie Jarrett, a former senior adviser to the former president who was the focus of a racist tweet by now-fired ABC sitcom star Roseanne Barr. After the tweet, Jarrett's name appeared on a pledge-to-vote- email distributed by OFA to woo voters. “There are days when we're reminded so clearly that we have not yet reached our destination, and that is why we have to work every day to treat our fellow citizens with dignity and civility,” Jarrett’s email said, without mentioning Barr. Holder will hold a conference call Jan. 7 to discuss the details of the merger. “If you say, ‘The Obama legacy will then be focused on redistricting,’ that’s the mechanism by which the things the Obama presidency were about will be preserved,” Holder said."	nonTerrorism	Politics
"Nielsen praises Mattis' work on border security hours after his sudden resignation, in exclusive interview"	" In an exclusive interview Thursday with ""Fox News @ Night,"" Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen praised Defense Secretary James Mattis' work on border security, just hours after he announced his sudden resignation. Mattis, whose departure will take effect Feb. 28, ""has proved to be an incredible partner"" to DHS on a variety of matters, including cybersecurity and counterterrorism, Nielsen said. ""We've signed a monumental memorandum agreement between our two departments to work on cybersecurity together. He certainly has been very supportive of our border security mission,"" Nielsen told anchor Shannon Bream. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In October, the Pentagon announced that nearly 6,000 troops would deploy to the U.S.-Mexico border to confront an approaching migrant Central American caravan. Earlier this month, Mattis signed an order keeping some troops in California, Arizona and Texas through January. Nielsen added that Mattis had helped ""with our counterterrorism mission, as we look to fight the terrorists abroad so they don't come here."" She called him a vital asset to the DHS' ""home game and away game."" Mattis' resignation came a day after President Trump announced plans to pull all 2,000 American troops out of Syria -- a move that top Republicans said would endanger Syrian Kurds allied with the U.S. and enable the Islamic State group (ISIS) to regain a foothold in the country. And on Thursday, a senior U.S. official told Fox News that Trump is seriously considering a “significant drawdown” of U.S. troops stationed in Afghanistan -- a position former President Barack Obama had championed in 2012. In his resignation letter, Mattis told Trump he has ""the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned"" with his own. ""I have complete admiration and respect for [Mattis] and have so enjoyed working with him,"" Nielsen said. Separately, Nielsen asserted that the border wall proposed by the Trump administration would effectively cut down on crime and illegal immigration. On Thursday, Trump insisted on a spending bill that includes $5.7 billion in funding for that wall. If Congress doesn't pass such a bill -- or if Trump vetoes a spending bill over a lack of funding for the wall -- the federal government will shut down Friday. ""Well first, I would just say, 'Walls work,'"" Nielsen said. ""We know they do. We have seen it in San Diego, we've seen it Yuma, everywhere we have that physical infrastructure."" Nielsen added: ""We see illegal immigration drop by 95 percent. The president will continue to advocate for what the men and women of the Border Patrol say they need. And this is what it is. It's a physical infrastructure along with the technology and personnel that go to it."" The DHS head also touted the agreement the U.S. secured with Mexico early Thursday so that immigrants claiming asylum will be returned to Mexico as their cases are processed -- a bid to end the practice known as “catch-and-release.” ""What we did is we took this as unilateral action under our statutory authority, but of course we have let the Mexicans know we were going to do it --  we've been having discussions for quite some time,"" Nielsen said. As a product of those discussions, Nielsen said, immigrants will be afforded the opportunity to gain work permits in Mexico, educational and medical resources, and the ability to apply for asylum there. ""For those who really need asylum, we encourage them to do it as soon as possible in that journey,"" Nielsen said, adding that she was ""optimistic"" about the new arrangement being legally formalized soon. At an explosive hearing earlier Thursday, Nielsen sparred with U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., on immigration policy, after he openly called her a liar. ""Shame on everybody that separates children and allows them to stay at the other side of the border fearing death, fearing hunger, fearing sickness,"" Gutierrez said. ""Shame on us for wearing our badge of Christianity during Christmas for allowing the secretary to come here and lie."" Nielsen shot back: ""Calling me a liar is fighting words. I'm not a liar, we've never had a policy for family separation."" A family separation policy, Nielsen added, ""would mean that any family that I found at a port of entry I would separate, it would mean that every single family that I found illegally crossing, we would separate. We did none of those."" Nielsen added that DHS was merely enforcing existing immigration laws that incidentally led to increased family separations due to a Clinton-era consent decree, but Gutierrez didn't hear her full reply. He pointedly left the hearing room as she spoke. ""It's not appropriate, it's not professional is accurate,"" Nielsen told Bream, referring to Gutierrez's comments. ""But secondly, again, we had no policy to separate families. ... If the parent has committed a crime and needs to be taken to a criminal area where we wouldn't want to take a child, or if the person is not related to the child,"" it is necessary to separate them, Nielsen said. ""The law says if you come here illegally, it's a crime,"" she continued. ""That's what we did. We tried to enforce the law."""	nonTerrorism	Politics
House approves spending bill with $5.7B for border wall	" The House of Representatives Thursday approved a bill that would fund most of the federal government through early February -- and provides $5.7 billion for President Trump's long-promised border wall, increasing the chances of a partial government shutdown later this week. Eight Republicans joined all 177 voting Democrats to oppose the measure, which passed 217-185. The bill now goes to the Senate, where it is certain to fall short of the 60 votes needed for passage since the chamber's 49 Democrats are against funding the wall. That, in turn, makes it more likely that parts of the federal government, including nine of 15 Cabinet-level departments and dozens of agencies, will cease operations at midnight Friday. The vote came hours after Trump told House GOP leaders that he would not enact a Senate-passed package that does not provide money for the barrier. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, whose leaders had pushed the hardest for Trump to stand his ground on the wall issue, said in a statement: ""Republicans in Congress have continually told the American people that we would fight for wall funding, and today the House of Representatives took its first step toward fulfilling that promise. The Senate must follow our lead. It’s time we do what we said and work with President Trump and the American people to secure our borders."" Trump congratulated Republican House members in a tweet late Thursday, saying he was ""so proud of you all."" ""Thank you to our GREAT Republican Members of Congress for your VOTE to fund Border Security and the Wall,"" he wrote. ""The final numbers were 217-185 and many have said that the enthusiasm was greater than they have ever seen before ... Now on to the Senate!"" In a subsequent tweet, Trump took a shot at House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who he said had claimed that ""Republicans didn’t have the votes for Border Security."" ""Nancy does not have to apologize,"" Trump said. ""All I want is GREAT BORDER SECURITY!"" The Senate measure, which passed by voice vote late Wednesday, provided a total of $1.6 billion for border security but did not include funding for a border wall. Trump's allies had warned him that he would have even less leverage to demand wall funding after Democrats take control of the House on Jan. 3 and worried that Trump's failure to make good on his signature campaign promise could hamper his re-election campaign. After meeting with Trump at the White House earlier Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told reporters that Trump had told them he would not sign the measure out of ""legitimate concerns for border security."" Conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh said Trump had ""gotten word"" to him that he would either be ""getting funding to the border or he's shutting the whole thing down."" A day earlier, Limbaugh complained that it appeared ""Trump gets nothing and the Democrats get everything, including control of the House."" The president issued threatening tweets and a stern statement from his press secretary before calling Republican lawmakers to the White House, where he told them he wasn't on board with the Senate measure, which would fund much of the government through Feb. 8. ""I am asking Congress to defend the border of our nation,"" Trump said at a White House event. ""Walls work, whether we like it or not."" Ratcheting up the suspense, Trump added: ""I look forward to signing a bill that fulfills our fundamental duty to the American people ... we'll see what we can do."" Democratic leaders were incredulous Thursday evening, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., saying the president was throwing a ""temper tantrum."" ""Today's events have made one thing clear: President Trump is plunging the country into chaos,"" said Schumer, referencing the resignation of Defense Secretary James Mattis in addition to the pending shutdown. "" ... The  Trump temper tantrum may produce a government shutdown. It will not get him his wall ...

Pelosi said the measure to fund a border wall was ""a shameful bill that is unworthy of this House of Representatives and certainly of the American people."" On the House floor, Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Md., accused Republicans of ""playing political games ... to pander to the president of the United States."" ""How sad it is that the Republican leadership of this Congress ... have consistently been unable to meet their fiscal responsibilities,"" Hoyer said. "" ... This bill is going nowhere. The Senate won't accept it. Now perhaps the Senate will send it back amended. Perhaps."" Despite his line in the sand, Trump appeared to float one possible path to compromise, referring to ""steel slats"" at the border rather than the concrete barrier he'd talked about during the campaign. With that phrasing, Trump appeared to be describing fencing, to which Congress is more amenable. The White House had previously floated another possible workaround, suggesting Trump would approve a deal with no wall dollars and pursue other funding options. Trump said he would use the military to fund and build the wall, while White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump had directed all his Cabinet secretaries to look for usable funds.

"Susan Collins reveals critics' personal attacks over Kavanaugh vote, in Fox News interview"	"Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, has revealed that the abuse she and her staff suffered over her vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court ""was unlike anything I've seen in all the years that I've been privileged to serve in the Senate."" ""There were protests at my home for six weeks in a row, protests at my home here in Washington, death threats, threats of sexual assault against me and my staff,"" Collins told Fox News' Martha MacCallum in an exclusive interview that aired Thursday evening on ""The Story."" ""But, what I'll never understand is why anyone would think that I would be intimidated by those tactics and that they would be successful in converting me or causing me to vote against Judge Kavanaugh."" Collins provided the crucial ""yea"" vote for Kavanaugh's confirmation, explaining her reasoning in an Oct. 5 Senate floor speech that climaxed a weeks-long battle centering on sexual-assault allegations against the federal judge dating from his high school days. At the time, Collins cited ""the lack of corroborating evidence"" of the claims against Kavanaugh by Christine Blasey Ford. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""The Senate confirmation process is not a trial, but there are certain standards we have to abide by,"" Collins said, ""and if we were going to throw overboard the presumption of innocence despite the complete lack of corroborating evidence even from Dr. Ford's best friend, and if we were going to dispense with fairness, the rule of law and due process, I really feared for what our country would become and whether anyone would be willing to put their name forth for public service? Who would go through that?"" Before, during and after the vote, Collins and her staff received threatening messages from opponents of Kavanaugh, some of which were shared with Fox News. At one point, Collins said, a young staffer ""who deals with Social Security problems and the VA and immigration answered a call in which the man told her that if I voted yes for Justice Kavanaugh that he hoped she would be raped and impregnated."" Collins added that the staffer quit working for her because ""she just could not take the tremendous abuse that was heaped upon [her]."" THREATENING LETTER WITH ALLEGED 'RICIN' SENT TO SUSAN COLLINS' MAINE HOME On another occasion, Collins said she was confronted outside her Washington, D.C. home by a man who shone a flashlight in her eyes and began recording her with a camcorder. ""The only funny thing about it, when I finally said to him – because I’m frantically trying to unlock my door – and I said: ‘You stop harassing me and by the way, what’s your name?’ And he gave me his name,"" Collins said. Collins' Kavanaugh vote has made her a target for Democrats who hope to flip her seat in 2020. She told MacCallum she'd made peace with the idea that her decision could cost her a fifth Senate term. ""The easier vote politically clearly would have been for me to vote 'no,'"" she said. ""But, that would not have been the right vote and I have to live with myself and I want to be able to look in the mirror in the morning and know that I did what I felt was right, no matter what the consequences may be ... I really won’t ever be intimidated. I have to do what I think is right and I’ll let the chips fall where they may."""	nonTerrorism	Politics
Lindsey Graham says withdrawing troops from Afghanistan could pave way for ‘second 9/11’	"Sen. Lindsey Graham offered a grim response to reports that President Trump is seriously considering a “significant drawdown” of troops stationed in Afghanistan, with the South Carolina lawmaker arguing that such a maneuver could make the U.S. vulnerable for “a second 9/11.” “The conditions in Afghanistan – at the present moment – make American troop withdrawals a high risk strategy,” the Republican politician tweeted. “If we continue on our present course we are setting in motion the loss of all our gains and paving the way toward a second 9/11.” The potential military decision would involve more than 3,000 U.S. troops getting pulled out, a senior U.S. official told Fox News earlier Thursday. There are 15,000 troops currently on the ground in Afghanistan. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The development was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Graham unleashed his criticism in reaction to the outlet’s reporting, saying on Twitter that he’d recently gotten back from a trip to Afghanistan “and can say – without hesitation – ISIS-K remains a direct threat to our homeland and they would dramatically benefit from a reduced American troop presence.” The fight against ISIS is not something that can be managed by America’s Afghan partners alone, the lawmaker said. And “our intelligence capability and military might” is irreplaceable “by any other regional ally” in regards to reducing the threat in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, he added. TRUMP PLANS ‘SIGNIFICIANT DRAWDOWN’ OF US TROOPS IN AFGHANISTAN, SENIOR OFFICIAL SAYS “Like in Syria, troop withdrawal should be based on conditions on the ground,” Graham tweeted. Graham, who in the past has been a reliable White House ally, also took issue earlier this week with the administration’s decision to remove 2,000 troops from Syria, calling the move “Obama-like.” “My theory is that by pulling 2,200 out in Northeastern Syria, that’s going to boost ISIS’ ability to come back,” he told Fox News on Wednesday. “But even more than that, the Kurds in Syria, who came forward when nobody else would to help us fight ISIS, fought bravely and died in large numbers, they’re going to feel abandoned.” Fox News’ Nicole Darrah, Jennifer Griffin and Brooke Singman contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Politics
" Defense Secretary James Mattis to retire at the end of February, Trump says"	" President Trump said Thursday evening that Defense Secretary James Mattis will be retiring in February, in a shock announcement adding to the list of the president's outgoing Cabinet members after his second year in office. Mattis will step down ""with distinction"" after serving in his role for two years, the president said on Twitter. ""During Jim’s tenure, tremendous progress has been made, especially with respect to the purchase of new fighting equipment,"" Trump tweeted. ""General Mattis was a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations. A new Secretary of Defense will be named shortly. I greatly thank Jim for his service!"" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A senior U.S. defense official told Fox News that Mattis was not pushed out of his role and this was not a forced resignation. ""He informed his staff after returning from the White House this afternoon,"" Pentagon spokesperson Dana White said. Fox News is told that Mattis met with Trump at 3 pm and later called his staff together for a meeting a little after 5 pm. Following the announcement, the Pentagon also released a copy of Mattis' signed resignation letter. Mattis wrote that he has ""been privileged to serve"" in his role as defense secretary and acknowledged the department's record during his time there. In his letter to Trump, Mattis acknowledged that a strong nation relies on a ""comprehensive"" network of alliances, and must be ""resolute and unambiguous"" in approaching countries with strategic differences, citing China and Russia. ""Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position,"" Mattis wrote. His departure date will be Feb. 28, 2019, which he noted should give the president and the department enough time to his replacement to be nominated and confirmed. He also pledged his ""full effort to a smooth transition."" ""I very much appreciate this opportunity to serve the nation and our men and women in uniform,"" Mattis concluded. Word of Mattis' resignation comes a day after U.S. officials confirmed that Trump's administration is making plans to pull all 2,000 American troops out of Syria. And on Thursday, a senior U.S. official told Fox News that Trump is seriously considering a “significant drawdown” of U.S. troops who are stationed in Afghanistan. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who earlier Thursday sparred with the president regarding the decision to pull U.S. troops from Syria, tweeted that it was ""with great sadness"" that he learned of Mattis' resignation, who he described as ""one of the great military leaders in American history."" ""General Mattis is a combination of intellect and integrity. He has been in the fight against radical Islam for decades and provided sound and ethical military advice to President Trump,"" Graham continued. ""He is a role model for the concept of Duty, Honor, Country."" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., also took to Twitter, arguing that the resignation was a ""national security crisis."" ""A Secretary of Defense quitting over a public disagreement with a President whose foreign policy he believes has gone off the rails is a national security crisis,"" Murphy tweeted. ""No way around it."" Fox News' Lucas Tomlinson and Jennifer Griffin contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Politics
"Ex-Senate Intel gatekeeper James Wolfe sentenced to two months in prison, despite DOJ push for two-year term"	" James Wolfe, the high-level Senate intelligence staffer who pleaded guilty in October to lying to investigators probing systemic leaks of classified information, was sentenced Thursday to two months in prison, plus four months of supervised release -- well under the two-year term prosecutors had aggressively sought. Wolfe had served for 29 years as the security director at the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), where he was responsible for handling virtually all critical classified information coming to the Senate from the executive branch. The Justice Department wrote in court filings that it wanted Wolfe punished harshly because he had ""significantly endangered"" national security, even as Wolfe's attorneys -- and senators on the SSCI -- urged leniency. U.S. District Court Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who was appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama, noted in court that Wolfe was well aware of the “value of truthfulness in a national security investigation.” But Jackson ultimately sided with federal sentencing guidelines that called for a term of between zero and six months of imprisonment. The judge fined Wolfe $7,500 and said she'd recommend that he serve his brief term at a minimum-security facility in Maryland. ""I am sorry. I am beyond embarrassed,"" Wolfe said in court prior to his sentence. ""I am beyond humiliated. I am beyond mortified."" He requested a term of probation, saying he had “never compromised classified information, never jeopardized national security"" while he was carrying out an extramarital affair with a reporter and, later, repeatedly lying to federal authorities in December 2017 about whether he had contacted her and three other reporters. Jackson said she was ""unmoved"" by Wolfe's statements, noting that ""it is the natural consequence of having chosen to break the law – the shame, the stigma, the changed social circumstances, they all go with the territory."" The judge added that ""we may well be living in an era of alternative facts"" -- an apparent dig at President Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway's use of the phrase last year -- but, she said, individuals who lie to investigators nevertheless ""will be taken seriously and treated seriously."" Prosecutors said Wolfe's conduct, in context and given his decades-long tenure as a top Senate intelligence staffer, demanded a two-year term of imprisonment. ""In the government's view, it's more than the falsehoods,"" prosecutor Jocelyn Ballantine told Jackson in advance of Wolfe's sentencing, adding that Wolfe had engaged in a ""course of duplicitous conduct over a four-year period."" Still, Jackson said the lengthier term of imprisonment requested by the Justice Department was not appropriate. “Having an affair is not a crime, maintaining relationships with reporters is not a crime, even giving sensitive non-public but not classified information to a reporter is not a crime,” Jackson said. In a declaration included in a Friday sentencing filing, the Justice Department revealed that Wolfe, 58, was at the center of the FBI's probe into the ""known disclosure"" of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant to surveil a top aide to President Trump. Wolfe was never charged specifically with leaking any classified information, even though prosecutors alleged he had used his several decades in the highly sensitive position to ""cultivate relationships with multiple young, female reporters, who were attempting to gain information."" He struck a plea deal with prosecutors to admit to a false-statements charge concerning his unauthorized contacts with reporters -- after his lawyers sent letters to each senator on the SSCI notifying them that they might need to testify as part of his criminal trial, if one occurred. Trump, at the time, said Wolfe's arrest “could be a terrific thing"" and called him a ""very important leaker."" ""The FBI did not uncover evidence that [Wolfe] himself disclosed classified national security information,"" the DOJ wrote in a court filing last week. The filing also openly discussed what was dubbed the difficult ""separation of powers issue"" at play as the executive branch agency investigates the Senate. ""The decision concerning how to proceed went to the highest levels of the FBI,"" the filing stated. In an affidavit attached to Friday's filing, the FBI special agent overseeing the Wolfe investigation noted that there had been a ""known disclosure of classified information -- the FISA application,"" apparently referring to the government's highly secret application to surveil former Trump campaign aide Carter Page. Page, who has never been charged with wrongdoing despite months of surveillance, is now suing several key players, including the Democratic National Committee (DNC), for alleged defamation stemming from their attempts to link him to Russian collusion in the wake of the leaked FISA application. Since-released, but redacted, portions of that FISA application revealed that the FBI told the FISA court it did not believe British ex-spy Christopher Steele was the direct source for a Yahoo News article implicating Page -- although court records showed Steele briefed the news agency. The application also revealed the FBI relied extensively on the unverified, salacious dossier funded by Trump's political opponents. The SSCI, which functions as a liason between the intelligence community and the Senate, is chaired by North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr and vice-chaired by Virginia Democratic Sen. Mark Warner. In the affidavit filed Friday, the lead FBI agent noted that the agency personally alerted Burr and Warner -- and only Burr and Warner -- that it was probing whether ""a person holding a Top Secret security clearance may have disclosed national security information to the news media."" The FBI instructed the two senators not to tell Wolfe about the probe in order to avoid the ""potential destruction of evidence"" as they continued to investigate, according to the affidavit. As part of their investigation, FBI agents obtained a search warrant and used imaging software to capture the contents of Wolfe's phone while they had him distracted and attending a meeting with FBI agents to discuss SSCI leaks, according to a separate DOJ court filing last week. Although the searches turned up evidence that Wolfe's actions had ""actual impact on the national security functions of the FBI and had the potential to disrupt important government functions,"" they did not turn up proof that he had leaked the FISA application or other classified materials, according to the DOJ. Wolfe served for 29 years as the SSCI's security director, and he has received letters of support in advance of his sentencing not only from Burr and Warner, but also from California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who previously chaired the SSCI."	nonTerrorism	Politics
Man accused of plotting to kidnap David Letterman's son released from prison	"A man once accused of plotting to kidnap retired talk show host David Letterman's son and nanny has been released from a Montana prison for a second time after serving additional years for violating parole. Kelly Allen Frank was released in mid-November and is under the supervision of parole officials, the Great Falls Tribune reported Saturday. Frank was a painter on Letterman's Montana ranch when he was arrested in 2005 on charges of solicitation to kidnap. Investigators said he told an acquaintance of a plan to abduct Letterman's son, Harry Joseph, then 16 months old, and the nanny for a $5 million ransom. In a deal with prosecutors, Frank pleaded guilty to theft for overcharging Letterman for painting. He also pleaded guilty to obstruction for lying to investigators and to an unrelated poaching charge. Prosecutors dropped the kidnap-related charge. Frank was sentenced to 10 years in prison but escaped in 2007. He was recaptured and given an additional 10-year sentence. He was released in 2014 but re-arrested in 2015 for violating the terms of his parole. The conditions of his latest parole include spending at least six months in semi-restricted housing and wearing a GPS monitor for at least six months. Letterman retired from ""The Late Show"" on CBS in 2015. He returned to TV this year with ""My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman"" on Netflix."	nonTerrorism	Entertainment
"Meghan Markle, Prince Harry join Kate Middleton, Prince William for Christmas Day service amid feud rumors"	"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry rang in their first Christmas as husband and wife with Prince William and Kate Middleton by their side. The royal brothers and their wives were all smiles as they arrived at St. Mary Magdalene Church in Sandringham in Norfolk, England Tuesday for a Christmas Day service. Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, held her husband's hand as she chatted with sister-in-law Kate amid rumors the duchesses are at odds. Wearing a red coat with a matching hat and shoes, Kate was all smiles next to Meghan who opted for an all-navy ensemble. Rumors over Kate and Meghan's alleged strained relationship have run rampant in recent weeks, even causing Kensington Palace to issue a rare statement after The Sun claimed the sisters-in-law had an argument over the way Meghan reportedly treated Kate's staff before her May nuptials to Prince Harry. ""This never happened,"" a royal spokesman said at the time. People magazine previously reported the palace does not usually respond to rumors concerning the family and did not issue a statement regarding any other reports, including one that Middleton was “left in tears” following a fitting for her daughter, Princess Charlotte’s dress for Markle’s nuptials to Prince Harry. “Kate has only just given birth to Prince Louis and was feeling quite emotional, though just what upset her is unclear,” a source claimed to veteran royal reporter Camilla Tominey of The Daily Telegraph, which confirmed separately that the pre-wedding incident did happen. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The outlet also added, citing several insiders, that at the time of Meghan and Harry’s wedding, there was a considerable amount of “stress” affecting everyone involved. Back in October, Kensington Palace announced Meghan and Harry were moving early next year to Frogmore Cottage, a house on the grounds of Windsor estate, ahead of the anticipated birth of their child. While the announcement further stirred rumors of a potential rift existing among the royals because of Meghan, the palace insisted the move is for a completely different reason. “Windsor is a very special place for their royal highnesses and they are grateful that their official residence will be on the estate,” the palace said in a statement. Although the move will mean that brothers William and Harry will no longer be living close by, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will still keep their office at Kensington Palace, which is also home to Middleton and William, both 36. Meghan and Harry are expecting their first child in the spring. The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Entertainment

Ben Stiller fires back after ex-prison worker calls him a liar	"Ben Stiller has a message for Joyce “Tillie” Mitchell following her claims that his hit Showtime mini-series “Escape at Dannemora” is filled with “lies.” “It’s not a documentary,” explained Stiller, speaking to Deadline about Mitchell’s jailhouse assessment to The Post on Sunday. “We did have to create scenes based on us inferring what we believed to be the truth.” “My guideline was always to try and tell what I thought happened,” Stiller added. “This was a story I wanted to tell in as full a way as possible and really tried to take into account the context of the world that everyone was living in. And the reality of what it means to be a worker in a prison and the situation that everybody deals with up there in that part of the state. I was just trying to tell the story in as real and hopefully as entertaining a way as possible without exploiting.” BEN STILLER,  SAYS HE APOLOGIZED FOR 'SIMPLE JACK,' STANDS BY SHAUN WHITE Mitchell, 54, blasted Stiller during her Post interviews last week at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in Westchester — where she’s currently serving a seven-year sentence for the 2015 prison break that was the basis for “Escape at Dannemora” — for portraying her as a lovesick prison seamstress.

‘It’s a Wonderful Life’ film secrets you probably haven’t heard	"There are plenty of reasons why “It’s a Wonderful Life,” which first premiered in 1946, is still considered to be one of the most popular Christmas films of all time. The beloved drama, directed by Frank Capra, tells the story of an angel named Clarence (Henry Travers) who is sent from heaven to help George Bailey (James Stewart), a desperately frustrated businessman on the verge of suicide. Clarence then shows George what life would really have been like if he had never existed. The black-and-white classic has become a staple during the holiday season and is still recognized as one of Stewart’s most iconic films. Jeremy Arnold, a film historian who recently published “Christmas in the Movies: 30 Classics to Celebrate the Season,” in partnership with Turner Classic Movies, said “It’s a Wonderful Life” is one of his personal favorites. And it’s a film longtime fans can still learn plenty from. ’Tis the season to tune in once more. And in time for the festivities, Arnold shared his favorite fun facts about “It’s a Wonderful Life”: “A writer named Philip Van Doren Stern came up with the idea of what became ‘It’s a Wonderful Life’ in 1938,” explained Arnold. “He said in an interview that he got the idea while he was shaving. He turned it into a two-page outline, but he could never really flesh it out. Five years later, he thought to add a Christmas setting to the story. He called it ‘The Greatest Gift.’ Then he [turned] it into a short story in 1943. He couldn’t sell it to anyone, so he printed up a few dozen copies himself as a little pamphlet, and he sent it out as his Christmas card that year.” “One of those cards with this story found its way to an agent who wound up selling it to RKO for I believe $10,000. RKO tried to turn it into a screenplay and they went through several writers, but no one could really do it. They gave it up and they sold it to Frank Capra.” Frank Capra was inspired by the film’s darkness. “Frank Capra had been making World War II training documentaries, which are very famous,” said Arnold. “He was looking now, after World War II, to get back into making Hollywood features. ‘It’s a Wonderful Life’ was a story that came to him and he liked it. He felt something had changed in American society because of World War II. “The darkness of the story was something he thought was appropriate and interested him to explore. His experience witnessing a lot of the horrors of the war had transformed him, too. Ironically, we remember the film for its lightness and joy, but it was this darkness that attracted Capra to it.” “This is a very important film in James Stewart’s career because it was a stepping stone into a phase of his career where he played much darker and more obsessed characters,” said Arnold. “He made a series of Western shorts for Anthony Mann a few years later, where he’s practically psychotic. He starred in ‘Vertigo’ where he is extremely disturbed psychologically. ‘It’s a Wonderful Life’ is probably the film where he explores that side of his character to such a degree.” Cary Grant was originally considered for the role of George Bailey. While the studio was set on having dashing English actor Cary Grant take on the role of George Bailey, it was Stewart whom Capra wanted for his film. “I think the reason Capra thought of him was that when they made ‘Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,’ that movie also has glimmers of this personality we see in George Bailey. There are some scenes in that movie where James Stewart goes kind of crazy. It’s a little messily unhinged, not to the degree here or in ‘Vertigo,’ but there was a hint of it there and Capra noticed it. Before “It’s a Wonderful Life,” snow in movies were usually created with cornflakes painted white. However, the sound they created when actors stepped on them was so loud that it often disrupted filming. This resulted in scenes frequently being re-shot and re-dubbing dialogue. However, Russell Shearman, who led the special effects team for “It’s a Wonderful Life,” had an idea. “They created a new way of doing snow, which combined water, sulfite, flakes of soap and I believe sugar,” said Arnold. “They found a way to create realistic-looking snow that did not crunch when you stepped on it. “That was a big deal at the time. The snow is really beautiful in ‘It’s a Wonderful Life’ and there’s a lot of it. I think that’s one subtle reason we love the movie so much. Because elements like that really create a cozy feeling when you’re watching it, whether in a theater or with your family.” “The swimming pool scene, where the floor of the high school gym opens up to reveal a swimming pool underneath and everyone falls in or jumps in?” said Arnold. “That was real. It’s still there at the Beverly Hills High School.” Actress Donna Reed served as the leading lady opposite Stewart in “It’s a Wonderful Life” as Mary Hatch and the pair naturally delivered a believable, astonishing performance. “The audience has to believe and feel the love between her and Jimmy Stewart because that is really what ultimately saves him in a sense,” said Arnold. “The connection that they forge and the screen chemistry that they gave is remarkable and it’s easy to take for granted. If we didn’t feel the connection he has with Mary, played by Donna Reed, really the story wouldn’t work."" The film was shot during a heat wave. “It’s a Wonderful Life” may be an iconic Christmas movie, but it was actually shot during the midst of a heat wave in the summer of 1946. It was so steamy at times Capra was forced to shut filming down for a day. In key moments of the film, you can see Stewart breaking a sweat when it’s supposed to be snowing and chilly. “The wonderful actress, Beulah Bondi, who plays Jimmy Stewart’s mother — she had played his mother before on screen,” said Arnold. “She would do so five times throughout their careers. The last time was in 1971, in an episode of ‘The Jimmy Stewart Show’ on TV.” The movie’s Bert and Ernie have no relation to “Sesame Street.” Over the years, fans have pointed out the cop and cab driver in “It’s a Wonderful Life” are named Bert and Ernie, just like the stripe-wearing buds on the hit children’s television series. However, Arnold insisted the film characters did not inspire “Sesame Street” in any way. “That’s a rumor that has been dispelled by the makers of ‘Sesame Street’ many times,” said Arnold. “One of the Hensons clearly said no and it’s just a coincidence.” When the film initially premiered in theaters, it wasn’t exactly a box office bomb, but it also didn’t do so great either. Arnold said there were several factors that explain why the movie wasn’t an instant success. “The advertising did not stress the Christmas element very much,” he said. “Instead, it portrayed the film more as a purely warm romance… almost a screwball comedy. But the film isn’t really that, and it’s possible audiences were turned off by its bleaker side.” Arnold added that during the time of the film’s release there was also terrible weather impacting the eastern U.S. with bitter cold and ice. Consequently, box office numbers were down across the board. Also, reviews may have played a role. “The reviews were not ‘bad,’ as it’s sometimes reported,” said Arnold. “They were positive, but not effusive.” “It’s a Wonderful Life” was rediscovered in the 1970s. The film may be a sought-after favorite now, but it was seemingly forgotten after its release until it was rediscovered decades later. “The film fell into public domain in the early 1970s I believe due to a clerical error,” explained Arnold. “The copyright was not renewed, so that meant any TV station, if they could get their hands on a print, or a copy of it, they could show it as many times as they wanted without having to pay anyone. “For about 20 years, every year in December, it was on about 50 times in any viewing area on many channels. Republic ultimately reacquired the rights to the short story and they renewed the rights to the music. All the multitudes of television airings stopped, and for quite a number of years now, the only place you can see it on TV every year is on NBC at Thanksgiving and Christmas. It’s never been on Turner Classic Movies, simply because they don’t have the rights to air it.” Frank Capra and James Stewart were thrilled over the film’s reemergence. “Capra and Stewart considered this film among their finest work, so they were very, very proud of it,” said Arnold. “Jimmy Stewart often told the story of accepting the role after Capra pitched it to him simply because it was a chance to work with Frank Capra again, whom he had done a few films with before World War II. “Stewart said Capra described the film as about an angel who comes to Earth, and he doesn’t have his wings and he helps prevent someone from taking his own life, and then the man goes off with the angel to see what his life would have been like. The way he was describing it, it sounded absolutely terrible, bizarre and ridiculous. But Stewart said ‘I’m in,’ because it was Capra who was proposing it. And the rest is history."""	nonTerrorism	Entertainment

"Mariah Carey looking for performance takers after Aspen getaway with twins, boyfriend Bryan Tanaka"	"It may not be too late to book Christmas queen Mariah Carey for your holiday party! The diva’s team has been seeking private parties for Carey to play, and recently sent out an email blast alerting p.r. pros and brands that Carey is “Available for Corporate & Private Events.” The blast also boasts, “New Album ‘Caution’ Out Now!!” and “Over 200 Million Albums Sold.” The alert goes on to explain (for anyone who wasn’t aware?) that “Mariah Carey is the best-selling female artist of all time with more than 200 million albums sold to date and 18 Billboard Hot 100 #1 singles (17 self-penned), more than any solo artist in history.” And that “Mariah’s ongoing impact has transcended the music industry to leave an indelible imprint upon the world at large.” Plus (oddly), “She made her entry into the world of independent film with her landmark performance in ‘WiseGirls’ starring alongside Academy Award winner Mira Sorvino and Melora Walters.” The one thing the alert doesn’t come with is a price for booking the “All I Want for Christmas Is You” chanteuse. Carey was spotted vacationing in Aspen, Colo., last week with boyfriend Bryan Tanaka and her twins, Monroe and Moroccan. The diva was seen hitting the slopes, as well as luxury stores, including Dolce & Gabbana.

 Billy Porter slams Kevin Hart for refusing to apologize for homophobic jokes	"""American Horror Story"" and ""Pose"" star Billy Porter had harsh words when asked about Kevin Hart stepping down from hosting the Oscars due to backlash over his alleged homophobic past material — and Hart's refusal to apologize for his past jokes. Hart's controversial material included bits about hoping his son doesn't grow up to be gay, as well as old tweets using homophobic slurs. When the Academy reportedly requested he apologize for the remarks, he opted out, saying in an Instagram video, ""I chose to pass. The reason I passed because I've addressed this several times. I've said where the rights and wrongs were. I've who I am now versus who I was then."" ""People think that words don't matter. I'm going to get into this Kevin Hart thing for just a second. Because it's not about you having a joke. That's not what it’s about,"" Porter, 49, fumed to Consequence of Sound. ""I've seen people and I've heard people who are not homophobic who do gay jokes. And you can tell that they're not homophobic."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Porter explained that other comedians can use homosexual themes in their material without being homophobic. ""I think Mo'Nique, a long time ago, she did a joke about butt sex. It was a whole thing about butt sex and 'the gays,' you know. And the punchline was something like, 'Yeah, but don't knock it till you try it!' And then we must stop the person who we know is using a joke, but she's not a homophobic person,"" he said. ""She's not saying, 'If I come home and my four-year-old son is playing with a baby doll house, I’m gonna break it over his head and tell him it's gay.' That crosses a line,"" he continued. ""Because that allows your fans to think that [you can] hit somebody because you don't like them. You don't like their sexuality, 'so I can bash you in the head.' We're not doing that anymore."" Porter said that part of what made his series ""Pose"" successful was the empowerment it provided to the LGBTQ community, especially in light of the conservative administration. ""It's march-into-the-streets time! We have an administration that thinks that it can, with a sentence, erase a whole group of people. And we're not going to do anything about it? Transgender people don’t exist? F—k that,"" he said. ""I say to Kevin Hart, and I say to D.L. Hughley, I say to those people who think that they don't need to apologize for s—t and dig their heels in their toxic masculinity: But you want your rights!

Kevin Spacey shares 'House of Cards'-inspired video as authorities announce he faces felony sex assault charge	" Kevin Spacey shared a bizarre video of himself Monday as his Frank Underwood character from Netflix's ""House of Cards"" after authorities announced he faces a felony charge for allegedly sexually assaulting the teenage son of former WCVB news anchor Heather Unruh at a Nantucket bar in July 2016. The Boston Globe was the first to report that Cape and Islands District Attorney Michael O'Keefe said the actor will be arraigned on a charge of indecent assault and battery on Jan. 7, 2019, at Nantucket District Court. A lawyer for Spacey did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment. However, as the news broke, the actor shared a video of himself on YouTube titled, ""Let Me Be Frank."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""I know what you want,"" Spacey says as Underwood in the video. ""Oh sure, they may have tried to separate us, but what we have is too strong, it's too powerful and after all, we shared everything, you and I. I told you my deepest, darkest secrets. I showed you exactly what people are capable of. I shocked you with my honesty, but mostly I challenged you and made you think. And you trusted me even though you knew you shouldn't. So we're not done, no matter what anyone says. And besides, I know what you want: You want me back."" Spacey's call to ""let me be Frank"" is seemingly in reference to Netflix firing him from the political drama after he was accused of sexual assault last year. Later in the video, the actor, still as Underwood, appears to reference his character's untimely death in the series saying, ""All this presumption made for such an unsatisfying ending and to think it could have been such a memorable send-off."" The 59-year-old actor also asks his listeners to refrain from rushing to judgment without evidence or facts because ""you're smarter than that ... Because I can promise you this, if I didn't pay the price for the things we both know I did do, I'm certainly not going to pay the price for the things I didn't do."" Spacey then acknowledges people will call him out for ""being disrespectful"" for ""not playing by the rules,"" but points out that he ""never did"" and ""you loved it."" ""Despite all the poppycock, the animosity, the headlines the impeachment without a trial, despite everything, despite even my own death, I feel surprisingly good and my confidence grows each day that soon enough you will know the full truth."" Spacey then pauses and references a spoiler from Season 6 of ""House of Cards,"" in which Underwood's ring reappears later in the season despite it allegedly being buried with him. ""Now that I think of it, you never actually saw me die did you?"" he asks after a long pause. He then puts on the ring from the show and concludes the three-minute video saying, ""Conclusions can be so deceiving. Miss me?"" The charge comes after Unruh alleged last year that Spacey groped her son in July 2016. According to her story, her son was 18 when he finished his shift as a busboy at a bar Spacey was at in Nantucket. He told the actor that he was of legal drinking age and Spacey reportedly bought him many drinks. When he was intoxicated, Spacey allegedly reached into the man's pants and grabbed his genitals without consent. A stranger approached her son, who is now a sophomore in college, to tell him to run, which he did. The family then filed a police report as the incident falls within the Massachusetts statute of limitations for this kind of crime. Spacey has been accused of sexual misconduct by nearly a dozen men as well at London’s Old Vic theater, where he served as artistic director from 2004 to 2015. An internal investigation into the theater allegedly found 20 counts of sexual misconduct by Spacey. ""Rent"" actor Anthony Rapp was the first to accuse the actor, alleging in October 2017 that Spacey made a sexual advance toward him when he was 14. Rapp told Buzzfeed News at the time that in 1986, Spacey, a fellow Broadway actor, invited Rapp to his apartment for a party. Later in the evening, Spacey, then 26, allegedly ""picked Rapp up, placed him on his bed, and climbed on top of him, making a sexual advance,"" according to the report. ""He was trying to seduce me,"" Rapp recalled. ""I don't know if I would have used that language. But I was aware that he was trying to get with me sexually."" Spacey released a statement on his Twitter after Rapp's accusations were made public, saying he has ""a lot of respect and admiration for Anthony Rapp as an actor"" and said he doesn't remember the encounter.

Meghan Markle urged to 'end the rift' with her father in Christmas card from half-sister	" Meghan Markle's half-sister reportedly sent the Duchess of Sussex a Christmas card urging her to ""end the rift"" with their father. Samantha Markle asked her half-sister to make contact with their father, Thomas Markle, in order to bring about joy in him during the last few years of his life, The Mirror reported. Thomas Markle has been suffering from heart trouble and reportedly fears he might not make it to next Christmas. ""This is not meant to be formal.

 ‘A Christmas Story’ star Zack Ward shares his favorite facts about filming the holiday classic	" Everyone who has seen the movie remembers the time when Ralphie Parker nearly shot his eye out. And everyone remembers Scut Farkus, the bully with ""the yellow eyes."" “A Christmas Story,” which premiered in 1983, tells the tale of a young boy (Peter Billingsley) living in the 1940s who attempts to convince his parents, his teacher and Santa that a Red Ryder BB gun is all he really wants for the holidays. Zack Ward starred as Farkus when he was just 13 years old. And even though the film came out over 30 years ago, it still airs continuously during Christmas. These days, Ward is the CEO of The Global Finance Sports Financial Exchange, a platform that allows sports fans to invest in their favorite teams, earning money each time their team wins and each calendar quarter. The 48-year-old still acts both in films and on television — but it’s “A Christmas Story” that fans continue to bring up. Ward spoke with Fox News about his favorite memories bringing “A Christmas Story” to life: “A lot of the snow was fake,” recalled Ward. “It was made out of potato flakes and shaving cream. Potato flakes and shaving cream and little pieces of plastic. The little plastic pieces, they look good, but they hurt when they get stuck in your eye. The shaving cream also burns. And the potato flakes did not taste good.” “The outside of Ralphie's house, it looks so picture-perfect with the icicles hanging from the tree — that’s all fake,” said Ward. “At that time in Cleveland, there was no snow. My mom and I walked from the hotel to get there and every other street, every house had their front yard covered with brown dead grass. But then you would turn the corner and there was this one house, which was turned into a winter wonderland. It was the first time I really saw what movie magic can do.” Bob Clark made a brief appearance in “A Christmas Story” as the dim-witted neighbor Swede who inquires about Old Man Parker's (Darren McGavin) “major award,” also known as the infamous leg lamp. “What he’s wearing is a nylon-filled jacket, which is a very 1980s thing to wear,” chuckled Ward. “It is not a 1940s thing to wear. So he is a time traveler in the movie. He’s completely inappropriately dressed.” Vanity Fair reported that while “A Christmas Story” did respectably at the box office, it disappeared in a few weeks. It also didn’t completely earn favorable reviews by critics at the time. “When I was a kid and the movie came out, nobody cared,” said Ward. “A Christmas Story” saw a resurgence that still exists today. Vanity Fair pointed out that at the same time “A Christmas Story” was taking off, MGM was heavily in debt. It ultimately sold its film library to Ted Turner in 1986. When Turner Broadcasting merged with Time Warner Inc., in 1997, Time Warner began running the film in a continuous loop. “I guess somebody liked it and thought it was a good choice,” said Ward. “Perhaps the film had a following within Turner and they already had the film. ""But then it started to become a thing. Even though the film never had a big release, it did well on VHS. People were collecting it and it became something that they were proud of. And back then VHS tapes were costly, so it was a collector’s item. There were marathons of the film. People just kept watching. And every year, people still buy the DVD even though you can watch it every year on TV. It’s pan-generational.” While many child stars in Hollywood ultimately struggle transitioning into adulthood both in front and behind the camera, Ward has managed to live a scandal-free life all while maintaining his high-profile career over the years. The secret? He avoided living in Hollywood. “I did not grow up in Los Angeles,” he explained. “I grew up in Toronto, Canada. Traveled around with my mother, who was also an actress. I asked her if I could be an actor and she said no. She wanted me to have a normal life. But eventually, she decided to give it a shot. “But I think the reason why I missed that after-school special of kids gone bad is that I only looked at acting as a craft. It was something to be honed. I was never into drugs. I was never into the party scene. I’ve never been cool. So I don’t think I was given the opportunity to fall from grace just because I wasn’t very high up."" Zack Ward still gets recognized as Scut Farkus. Ward insisted that even now, fans of “A Christmas Story” still recognize him on the street and aren’t shy to approach him. “I have a prominent place as that red-headed kid with the funny eyes,” he said. “It’s not a level of say, Tom Cruise, but it’s recognizable. I’ve done over 100 films, but I’m always that guy. And there’s just not a lot of redheads on television. So you do stand out when you’re in something. Even if I’m wearing a hat with glasses, if I’m walking down the street or having dinner, people will still come up to me and ask questions about the film. I think it’s very sweet.” Zack Ward never got to keep those hats. Farkus’ signature look was undoubtedly his raccoon fur cap. However, Ward never got the chance to keep any of them as prized mementos from his time on set. “The funny thing is that back then, I just didn’t see them as collectibles,” he said. “No part of me thought this was going to be something that the whole country, Australia and Canada fell head over heels in love with. I didn’t collect anything.” Zack Ward still gets paid for “A Christmas Story.” In 2017, Page Six reported that the actors are still getting royalty checks. However, it’s not as much as many think. “You’re going to be so disappointed,” he told the newspaper. “It’s basically about $1,800 every two years… and it comes in Canadian money because we shot in Canada.” Ward added he puts the extra cash in a special account just in case his mom needs it in the future. The classic Christmas melody “Baby, It’s Cold Outside” stirred headlines during the holiday season after some listeners felt it was a prelude to date rape. However, Ward isn’t fazed by the notion that some viewers today may consider viewing “A Christmas Story” differently. “If someone wants to get upset about things, they can totally choose to,” he said. “I know that some people take issue with the bullying in the movie. But there’s also a kid standing up for himself. Not that I think all problems should be solved with your fists by any stretch of the imagination. “[But] if people are upset with that concept in ‘A Christmas Story,’ then they should change the channel and go watch something else. And I fully support their right to make that decision. But they should let the people who want to watch it, well, watch it.” Many fans may assume Ward enjoys reliving his childhood by tuning in and watching “A Christmas Story” as a beloved holiday tradition. But when asked about his favorite Christmas film, Ward didn’t hesitate to give his answer. “‘Die Hard,’” he revealed."	nonTerrorism	Entertainment

Sacha Baron Cohen: Planned Ben Carson takedown fell apart after White House pulled the plug	" Sacha Baron Cohen almost added Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson to his roster of high-profile figures he pranked on his controversial comedy series ""Who is America?"" but he revealed the White House thwarted his attempt at the last minute. The ""Borat"" actor and Carson's team set up an interview at the Mandarin Hotel in Washington, D.C., Cohen told Deadline in an interview published last week. He'd been living ""undercover and in disguise"" in D.C. for a few weeks leading up to the interview. Cohen said that on the day of the interview, they'd had ""bad luck [because] there was a big international conference of politicians"" at the hotel. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""[Former Secretary of State] Condoleezza Rice was there, a bunch of other politicians, and the whole place was filled with Secret Service, some of whom were completely undercover and some of whom were clear,"" Cohen said. Cohen's team and Carson's team -- which included his own Secret Service detail and White House press staff -- made it to the room for the interview, and Cohen made his way toward the camera, in character for the show. ""This character has a bunch of Shopkins [collectible toy figures], and the White House press representative was there,"" Cohen recalled. ""He says, ‘What are those?’ I say, 'These are Shopkins.'"" SACHA BARON COHEN'S 'WHO IS AMERICA?' TV SHOW HAD DELETED SCENE EXPOSING ALLEGED PEDOPHILE RING: REPORT Cohen said the press rep questioned why the Shopkins were there, to which he replied: ""It's because that's what I do, I unbox Shopkins."" At that point, Cohen said, Carson was ""literally walking in front of the camera. He's just about to enter the frame and this guy from the White House had an instinct and he said, 'Pull him.'"" ""And suddenly the Secret Service pulled him out. So the most I got to see was Ben Carson’s leg,"" Cohen told Deadline. And so, Carson wasn't duped by Cohen, like many of America's politicians did. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., appeared on the show — even though Cohen said his ""people had been suspicious from day one."" Former Maricopa County, Ariz., Sheriff Joe Arpaio, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., and former Rep. Joe Walsh, R-Ill., were among those tricked by Cohen. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was also interviewed by Cohen and voiced her anger, but he claimed she was cut from the show because ""there was no comedy gold."""	nonTerrorism	Entertainment
Macaulay Culkin reprises 'Home Alone' role in new Google ad	"Macaulay Culkin reprised his role as Kevin McCallister in the Christmas classic ""Home Alone"" in an advertisement for Google Assistant. In the ad released Wednesday, 38-year-old Culkin got back into character as the witty 8-year-old. With the help of the Google Assistant, the actor helped to modernize many of the scenes from the 1990 film. ""Hey Google, what's on my calendar today?"" McCallister asked, to which the virtual assistant replied: ""You have one event called, 'House to yourself.'"" Recreating iconic scenes from the movie, McCallister shaved his face, jumped on the bed, and decorated the Christmas tree all while asking the assistant to set reminders for him.

"Wayne Brady slams Louis C.K., Ricky Gervais, Chris Rock over N-word use"	"Comedian Wayne Brady didn't see anything funny about a resurfaced 2011 video of Louis C.K., Ricky Gervais, Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld mulling over the use of the N-word. LOUIS C.K. DRAWS CRITICISM OVER USE OF THE N-WORD IN 2011 CLIP ""It was inappropriate. Louis C.K. shouldn't have been saying it, Chris Rock shouldn't have signed off on it, Ricky Gervais sure as hell shouldn't have said it — and I'm a big Ricky Gervais fan,"" Brady, 46, told TMZ on Sunday. Brady also wasn't impressed with Seinfeld, despite the sitcom legend being visibly uncomfortable and swearing that he'd never used the racial slur on or offstage. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Seinfeld stayed out of it, but that doesn't make him a hero or a saint — it just makes him tactically smart,"" Brady said. In the conversation, a resurfaced clip from a 2011 episode of HBO's ""Talking Funny,"" Rock and C.K. discuss their use of the slur, while Gervais says he doesn't use the word — but says the word within his own denial. ""I think that it's an inappropriate conversation, but on the flip, it's also an old tape. And this thing of old things being drudged up: It happened, I'm sure that Chris addressed it at some point. I haven't heard him speak out about it, I just think it's completely inappropriate that Louis C.K. felt so comfortable. People feel too comfortable saying it,"" Brady fumed. ""Just don't. I don't care if your best friend is the blackest person in the world, just don't."" ""That word has so much history connected to it, just err on the side of class: Don't say it,"" the ""Whose Line Is It Anyway"" alum said. Brady acknowledged that some people of color use the term, but explained that the context is completely different in those circumstances, advising, ""If you're not in that culture and you're part of the culture that at one point used that to hurt and subjugate [the black community], just don't use it."" The backlash against C.K.'s use of racial slurs is only the latest scandal to plague the comedian. In November 2017, several female comedians came forward to the New York Times alleging that C.K. had sexual harassed them and masturbated in their presence. He later confessed to the allegations.

How the Gary Sinise Foundation teamed with Snowball Express to send Gold Star families to Disneyland	" Gary Sinise opened up about how his namesake foundation teamed up with Snowball Express to treat Gold Star families to Disney trips for the holidays. In a chat with The Hollywood Reporter, Sinise, 63, revealed that Snowball Express was started in 2006 by ""a few people that wanted to focus on healing and to help the children of our fallen heroes."" The founders teamed up with American Airlines to send several hundred kids to Disneyland that year. Well aware of the ""Forrest Gump"" star's longtime support for veterans' and military families' causes, Snowball Express came to Sinise in spring 2007 and showed him a video of the event. He signed up to support the December 2007 Snowball Express, in which they brought more children to Disneyland, and Sinise performed for them with his Lt. Dan Band. In 2011, he went on to found the Gary Sinise Foundation, into which Snowball Express eventually folded. ""They’re dealing with the grief and the loss of a loved one, a mom or a dad who have died in military service, and all these kids are going through the same thing, so the power of all of them in the same place at the same time, many of them — hundreds of them — was very healing for a lot of them,"" Sinise said. MARINE VET GETS SMART HOME (AND INDEPENDENCE) FROM GARY SINISE FOUNDATION ""You cannot underestimate the power of bringing all these kids together in a happy environment because we’re trying to bring joy to them right before the holidays, right before the Christmas holidays, which is a difficult time for a child who’s lost a parent — so bringing all these kids together at the happiest place on earth in Disney World was very, very special,"" he continued. The trip to Disney was a combination of free roaming throughout to go on rides, but it began with an opening dinner and ceremony on Main St. approaching Cinderella's Castle. There's also a flag garden with more than 600 flags for each fallen member of the families in attendance. ""There's a lot of healing that goes on. We have counseling, we have all kinds of communal activities that focus on the healing aspect of a gold star family member who's grieving, but we also want to provide hope and happiness and joy and all of that."" ""It’s heartwarming because it makes you feel good to see the kids laughing and having a fun time, but it’s also heartbreaking because you know why they’re there,"" he explained of the Snowball Express trips. ""They’re there because of loss and grief, and because they are a military family who's paid the ultimate price."" ""You will see children walking around with buttons of their fallen hero, their father or whoever it was, sometimes they have T-shirts with pictures ... Some of the kids I will see every year. They'll come back and they'll be just a little bit bigger every year, and they'll be wearing that button or that T-shirt. I'm just there to honor their loved one and to show them that we love them."" Aside from bringing joy to children of fallen military members, Sinise says his foundation works with other aspects of the military and veteran experience, and that he'd like to expand their work into preventing military and veteran suicides and improving mental health among military members and vets. ""Prior to the Gary Sinise Foundation, I was engaged with so many military charities who do all kinds of different things, that I saw a lot of need in all these different areas,"" he said.

DA declines sexual-assault charges against Steven Seagal for second time	"The Los Angeles district attorney declined to file sexual-assault charges against Steven Seagal for a second time, Variety reports, citing that the statute of limitations in the allegation had expired. A woman reportedly claimed to the LAPD that the action star raped her in 2002. The victim was not identified, but attorney Lisa Bloom told press that the accuser was a woman that she represented.

Its hands are tied by this unfair law which bars the courthouse door even to young women like my client, Faviola Dadis, who is highly credible. The law fails to recognize that few minors are emotionally ready to seek justice against their rapists until many years later. Instead, it offers rapists a 'get out of jail free' card if they simply pass an arbitrary time deadline. And the law seems to presume that victims are lying, creating an unfairly high evidentiary standard not required in other criminal cases. Few rapists commit their crimes in the presence of witnesses."" In September, the D.A. declined to charge Seagal with sexual assault over an alleged 1993 incident, also reportedly due to the statute of limitations expiring.

WILLIAM SHATNER BATTLES WITH FANS OVER 'BABY IT'S COLD OUTSIDE' ""[The song 'Baby It's Cold Outside' is] just offering an invitation and presenting an argument for not leaving,"" Shatner, 87, told DailyMail TV this week. ""You're not saying, 'I'm closing the door and you can't leave!' It's not force, it's verbal persuasion, which works in the act."" ""In 2018 we have the #MeToo movement, which I think is great, that these hidden forces are exposed and not to be allowed and women have equal rights,"" he noted. ""I've got three daughters [ages 60, 57 and 54], I'm all for that. But if you look back at things that were written and said 20, 30 years ago, it’s a different context, and you've got to judge it by that context. Rape and pillage, absolutely not — those are crimes against humanity. But saying 'Would you make love with me?' and the opposing party says 'yes' or 'no,' I can't fathom what’s wrong with that."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He continued, ""It's like saying, 'Would you have dinner, would you like to write a song with me, would you do an interview?'

""It's a whole new culture. The whole business has changed. The whole man-woman relationship has changed to a severe degree,"" he said. ""It's all about sensitizing you to what is harassment. You might say, as I have on numerous occasions, 'looking good,' 'wow, what a great dress,' 'great legs,' 'I love your hair.'

""Aquaman,"" directed by James Wan, has proven to be a stabilizing ""Justice League"" spinoff for Warner Bros. following bumpier DC releases outside of ""Wonder Woman."" The film garnered an A-minus Cinemascore from audiences. For the studios, the weekend was as much about setting themselves up for Christmas to New Year's, when theaters are routinely packed through the week. With Christmas falling on a Tuesday, studio executives said the weekend was an unpredictable and distraction-filled one, competing with some of the busiest shopping days of the year. ""We really kick off starting Tuesday,"" said Warner Bros. distribution chief Jeff Goldstein, who said the ""Aquaman"" performance came in just above the studio's $65 million forecast. ""With kids not really returning to school until January 7, this aligns the stars for us in a really positive way."" Returns were more modest for Disney's ""Mary Poppins"" sequel and Paramount's ""Transformers"" spinoff, though each had reason to expect strong business through the holidays. ""Mary Poppins Returns,"" starring Emily Blunt and directed by Rob Marshall, debuted with $22.2 million over the weekend and $31 million since opening Wednesday. That was on the low side of expectations for the musical, which cost $130 million to make. ""May Poppins Returns,"" which co-stars Lin-Manuel Miranda, will depend heavily on legs through the holiday season. On its side are good if not spectacular reviews (77 percent fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), an A-minus CinemaScore from moviegoers and four Golden Globe nominations. ""It's a great weekend to start yourself off on a launch pad into the holiday period,"" said Cathleen Taff, head of distribution for Disney. ""We're looking forward to great word of mouth building over the next few weeks. And we're looking forward to a long run."" ""Poppins"" still narrowly edged ""Bumblebee,"" which opened with $21 million. That, too, is a soft beginning for a film that cost about $135 million to make after tax credits. It's also far off the pace of the ""Transformers"" films, the last of which (""Transformers: The Last Knight"") debuted with $44.7 million in summer 2017. But ""Bumblebee,"" a ""Transformers"" prequel directed by Travis Knight and starring Hailee Steinfeld, has something the Michael Bay films never had: good reviews. ""Bumblebee"" was the weekend's most acclaimed new wide release with a 94 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences also gave it an A-minus CinemaScore. ""The pre-Christmas preoccupation for moviegoers affected everyone. All movies were impacted slightly by that,"" said Kyle Davies, head of distribution for Paramount. ""It doesn't concern me. We played really well with great reactions. The game plan has always been that we're now starting that play period where people go multiple times over the next few weeks, and that's the whole point."" ""To me, this weekend was a dress rehearsal for the big push that starts Christmas Day,"" added Davies. Also in the mix is Sony's well-reviewed ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,"" which slid to fourth in its second week with $16.7 million in ticket sales. The film also made one of the best debuts for an animated release in China where it was no. 1, grossing $26.1 million over the weekend. Clint Eastwood's ""The Mule"" added $9.3 million in its sophomore frame, bringing its two-week total to $35 million. Bradley Cooper, who co-stars in ""The Mule,"" could also celebrate his ""A Star Is Born"" crossing $200 million domestically. Largely overlooked in the onslaught at theaters was STXfilms' ""Second Act,"" starring Jennifer Lopez. The romantic comedy debuted with an estimated $6.5 million in 2,607 locations, drawing an audience that was 70 percent female. But the weekend's real flop was ""Welcome to Marwen,"" the Robert Zemeckis-directed fantastical drama starring Steve Carell as an imaginative man whose scale model town helps him rehabilitate after a trauma. The film, which cost at least $40 million to make, earned just $2.3 million in 1,900 theaters. It's the second straight flop for Universal (which teamed with DreamWorks for ""Marwen"") following ""Mortal Engines."" That $100 million film debuted last weekend with $7.5 million film in ticket sales. Yet the weekend managed to nearly equal the box office of the same weekend last year when ""The Last Jedi"" was in its second week of release and ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" opened. Ticket sales for the ""Star Wars""-less weekend were down a mere 2.1 percent, according to Comscore. Year to date, the domestic box office is up 7.5 percent and was expected to just eke past 2016's record $11.38 billion sometime late Sunday or early Monday, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. ""The collective and cumulative strength of these newcomers, particularly 'Aquaman,' and a huge slate of holdovers gave us a stronger weekend than anyone imagined,"" Dergarabedian said. ""A superhero movie in December can make up for not having a 'Star Wars' movie in December.""

Al Sharpton blasts Travis Scott over alleged Super Bowl halftime show hypocrisy	"Jay-Z isn't the only person upset with Travis Scott for agreeing to perform with Maroon 5 at the 2019 Super Bowl halftime show. Rev. Al Sharpton slammed Scott, claiming that Scott essentially turned his back on the Black Lives Matter movement and police brutality against people of color by agreeing to perform at the NFL's biggest night. ""I think anyone that goes into the halftime show is in effect directly violating those that want to raise the question that the NFL should come to terms with what they have done and continue to do to Colin Kaepernick and those that protest on criminal justice issues,"" Sharpton told TMZ in a clip posted early Saturday. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""You can't tell people to stand for those that take a knee and don't go to the games and then say 'but somebody ought to perform there and entertain.' You're drawing TV viewers, you're bringing supporters, and I think that you can't have it both ways,"" Sharpton fumed. ""You can’t help people market something and then turn around and say you agree with the people protesting."" Sharpton then referenced other artists who refused to perform the halftime show with Maroon 5, including Cardi B and Rihanna, who each collaborated with the band in the past. ""I think he should do what a lot of other major artists have done: say 'I'm not going to participate,’ "" Sharpton concluded. ""You can't fight against Jim Crow and then go sit in the back of the bus."""	nonTerrorism	Entertainment
Cardi B won't perform at Super Bowl halftime show with Maroon 5 in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick	"Cardi B's rep set the record straight on why the rapper refused to perform at the Super Bowl halftime show with Maroon 5, with whom she collaborated on No. 1 hit ""Girls Like You."" Sources told Page Six that Cardi, 26, demanded $1 million and ""the red carpet treatment"" to perform at football's biggest night, but her publicist shot down the claims. ""The rumor circulating that she wants a million dollars and she wants her own set is false,"" Cardi's rep told Page Six. ""There was never a firm offer to begin with for a performance. There [were] talks about it, but she was not particularly interested in participating because of how she feels about Colin Kaepernick and the whole movement ... But again, there was never a solid offer for her to say yes or no to regarding the Super Bowl. She is already confirmed to do a set with Bruno Mars that weekend."" Maroon 5 reportedly had issues finding guests who'd participate in the performance before signing on rapper Travis Scott, as many artists planned to boycott the Super Bowl to show support for Colin Kaepernick and other NFL players who knee during the national anthem to police brutality against people of color. Rihanna, who collaborated with Maroon 5 on ""If I Never See Your Face Again,"" was reported to have previously turned down a spot on the halftime show in support of Kaepernick. Rapper Jay-Z, who said he turned down the Super Bowl halftime show in 2017, is rumored to be trying to talk Scott out of performing at the 2019 game."	nonTerrorism	Entertainment
Flip or Flop' star Christina El Moussa marries Ant Anstead in secret wedding	"Their relationship wasn't a flop: ""Flip or Flop"" star Christina El Moussa has a new husband in TV presenter Ant Anstead after dating for just a year.

CBS Studios sued over 'MacGyver' reboot	"Two groups that claim the CBS update of ""MacGyver"" entitles them to payments based on a deal dating from the original series are suing. The plaintiffs are Hanzer Holdings and Arlita Inc. — both of which are described as “successors in interest” to Major Talent Agency, the packaging agent for the original 1985-92 ""MacGyver"" series that was exec produced by Henry Winkler and John Hall. According to their lawsuit filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court (read it here), MTA was a third-party beneficiary of the 1984 deal with CBS Studios’ predecessor in interest, Paramount Television, that spawned the series. That pact included a “package commission” agreement between MTA and Paramount that the suit says covered “each series produced under the 1984 Agreement.” Fast-forward to February 2016, when CBS Studios announced that it had greenlighted a pilot for the new ""MacGyver."" The suit notes that the project was “referred to by CBS Studios and others variously as a ‘reboot.’ ‘remake’ and/or ‘spinoff’, but it is, in fact, a ‘spinoff series’ as contemplated by the 1984 Agreement.” The complaint alleges that the plaintiffs contacted CBS Corp to advise it that, as successors to MTA, Hanzer Holdings and Arlita were entitled to a package commission. With the new series now well into its third season, the companies say that “CBS Studios has refused to make any payments to Plaintiffs or their predecessors in interest.” Attorneys Ronald Nassim, Ariel Neuman and Andrew McTernan of Bird, Marella Boxer Wolpert in Los Angeles are representing the plaintiff in the suit, which seeks a jury trial and unspecified damages."	nonTerrorism	Entertainment
"The Runaways' Jackie Fuchs talks 'Jeopardy' success, law career and 'Dating Game' past"	"When attorney Jackie Fuchs first appeared on “Jeopardy!” Dec. 14, viewers who recognized her from a past life had to wonder if the producers of the show were off their own game, as it were. Was it possible the trivia masters at “Jeopardy!” didn’t even know the night’s ace player was Jackie Fox, bass player for the “all-girl” 1970s band the Runaways? Host Alex Trebek, whose favorite record apparently is not “Cherry Bomb,” hadn’t registered it, but it was hardly a secret to the producers. They’d agreed with Fuchs’ request to withhold that information until she had a couple of winning nights under her belt and had proven that she was smarter than your average rock star and/or a 5th grader. “I asked them not to raise it unless I got to a third day, because it’s so easy to have that define who I am,” Fuchs tells Variety. “And I just didn’t want to be that person who goes on TV and says, ‘I was in the Runaways!’ Because it overshadows everything else that I’ve done in my entire life. And I think it also would have overshadowed how well I needed to do to get to game three. I liked the fact that the people who already knew who I was could be in on that knowledge that other people didn’t have, and then people who had been watching me would be able to discover it… At the end of the second show, during the closing credits, when Alex is over talking to the contestants, I told him that I was in a band and that I wanted to talk about it the next day.” As it turns out, she could have saved that big reveal for yet another night, as she made it to a fourth night, which was broadcast Thursday, before being eliminated, having won just over $87,000 at that point. The producers still had one pretty good piece of trivia to save for her fourth appearance: that, back in 1980, she’d been a contestant on a game show where her knowledge of Dylan Thomas came in a lot less handy: “The Dating Game.” “Oh, I have no idea,” Fuchs says, asked if she might be the only person in history to compete on both “Jeopardy!” and “The Dating Game.” “That’s a good question.” If she seemed slightly flustered, it’s not because she’s tried to suppress that OG game-show appearance, but “it was the first time I didn’t have some idea of what Alex was going to ask me about, and so I wasn’t ready as I had been on the other three days, and there was this moment where it fell quiet and then I sort of blurted out, ‘Well, it’s still on YouTube.’ And I think 30,000 people or something have watched it in the last 24 hours — it’s crazy.” Fuchs doesn’t have many direct points of contact with rock ‘n’ roll or other contemporary music anymore, which may help explain why she missed a SZA question. Even things where she did once have some direct connection weren’t her strong suit. She and her fellow contestants all failed to identify the author of the memoir “Anger Is an Energy” — even though Fuchs once danced for a bit with John Lydon, who was then Johnny Rotten, at a foreign nightclub in the late ‘70s. Other questions (or answers) that hit close to home also didn’t give her a leg up. “There was a question about some place that had been a location for this film ‘K-19: The Widowmaker’ (a 2002 Harrison Ford vehicle). I couldn’t come up with it at all, — even though I was the production lawyer on that picture. So I literally negotiated the location for ‘K-19.’” Redemption was heavy on Fuchs’ mind. “I was on ‘The Chase’ on the Game Show Network — it’s not on anymore — where it was very rapid-fire questions and you ended up going up against this world quizzing expert who’s smarter than all three contestants combined, and you were just trying to combine forces to see if you could defeat him. And we couldn’t. I did not acquit myself well on that show, but it made me want to get back up and do it again. So I went on ‘Who Wants To Be A Millionaire’ (in 2013) — and I still didn’t acquit myself that well, but it was better. I figured I would try one more time, and this time I was ready.” In both of those earlier cases, she was identified as an ex-Runaway immediately before flaming out, “which is also part of the reason why I didn’t want to lead with that” on “Jeopardy!” Not surprisingly, “Jeopardy!” is her favorite of the shows she’s been on, not just because of its marquee value, but “because you can get an answer wrong and still win on ‘Jeopardy.’ And it’s fast response, but not the total rapid-fire of that first game show I went on, where it was bam-bam-bam-bam-bam. Also, this tends to have a little more classical learning along with pop culture. Like, one of my categories was ‘4th Century bookstore,’ and it was about literature from the 4th century. There was also ‘People who played super villains on Broadway,’ and I was a hell of a lot more comfortable with the 4th century bookstore category.” In her non-lawyering hours, Fuchs is part of a pub trivia team, which she considers a “kind of painless way to learn new stuff.” Along with reading the encyclopedia, right? “I don’t read the encyclopedia, but I do read books that interest me. Like everybody else these days, in the era of social media and smartphones, I find it harder to read than it used to be, but I still do. And I’ll watch documentaries on PBS or the History Channel, and I’m just really interested in things. There’s just so much to know. And so I tend to be bad at pop culture because I just don’t find it as interesting as science and history and literature. But I guess I still absorb just enough of it. I try to read the L.A. Times from front page to last page, and that’s really how I stay up-to-date on pop culture to some extent. If I had the time I would read more than one newspaper, but I decided to support local journalism, because I think that’s really important — even though it means my knowledge of Broadway ends up being worse for not having access to east coast news.” Here’s a trivia question even Fuchs can’t answer: when she last picked up a bass guitar. “I just listen to music and enjoy it as a fan,” she says. “And honestly these days I’m more inclined to listen to classical music and opera than to rock, mostly because rock scares the cat.” She amends that. “Actually, so does opera. The first time I played opera in the house, both of my cats looked for a place to hide. Which I’m sure a lot of rock fans can relate to.” Fuchs was in the news in 2015 as she spoke up on some more important but less fun topics — rape and consent — as a vocal advocate for victims who might be seen as sharing in blame because they were incapacitated. She was then publicly alleging for the first time having been raped by the Runaways’ founder and manager, Kim Fowley, now deceased. (Fellow former band members Cherie Currie and Joan Jett alternately disputed her account or denied knowledge of it, ensuring further estrangement than had already existed. Earlier, Fuchs had been essentially written out of “The Runaways,” the 2010 musical biopic, following a legal dispute.) JOAN JETT SUING BASSIST OF THE RUNAWAYS OVER MOVIE ABOUT THE ALL-GIRL ROCK BAND Enjoying more light-hearted media attention now is “kind of weird,” Fuchs says, “but I guess it’s all weird. I’m just not used to thinking of myself as somebody who ought to be in the news for anything. But I definitely prefer being in the news for something that I affirmatively did, as opposed to for something that happened to me. And it’s definitely easier talking about being on ‘Jeopardy’ than it was talking about being raped, for sure.” Now the “Cherry Bomb” setter-turned-Harvard grad (she attended alongside Barack Obama) turned attorney is making the news for being a smart (ex-) rock star… which the most waggish among us might consider a bit of a man-bites-dog story. “Hey, Bruce Dickinson can fly 747s,” she counters, sticking up for the rich tradition of brainiacs in rock. “You didn’t know that? He pilots Iron Maiden’s 747 to tour stops. Come on. That’s way more interesting than anything I’ve ever done.” There’s an outside chance Fuchs will be back on with Trebek in the latter half of next year, if she qualifies as a wild-card contestant for the show’s Tournament of Champions. Asked if she has any other game-show aspirations now that she’s acquitted herself on “Jeopardy!,” the Mount Everest of game shows, Fuchs is happy to retreat to legal minutiae and pub trivia for now. “Yeah, it is the Mount Everest, the Aconcagua and the Chimborazo all rolled into one,” Fuchs points out. She notices the dead silence on the other end of the line. “I’m going to make you look that up, huh?”"	nonTerrorism	Entertainment
Steve Carell reveals how the iconic 'I love lamp' scene in 'Anchorman' came to be	"Like every action of his “Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy” character, Brick Tamland, Steve Carell revealed that not much thought went into the iconic “I love lamp” exchange in the cult-favorite movie. “I love that I’m talking about my method in creating Brick Tamland, let me delve into it,” Carell joked to the audience during a conversation at the 92nd Street Y on Thursday night. “I would stand in front of the camera and say these non-sequiturs.” In the 2004 film where Will Ferrell’s character, anchorman Ron Burgundy, leads his San Diego news team — including weatherman Tamland — on various adventures in the 1970s, Carell recalled the film’s director Adam McKay wanting to give him more lines. “Adam was like, ‘We should have more lines for you, but we don’t have any on the page.’ He literally said ‘Just say something,’ and hence came ‘I ate a big red candle’ [and] ‘I love lamp,'” he recalled. But Carell said that his co-stars quickly caught on to his improv, which made for the funny bit and memorable one-liner. “The ‘I love lamp’ thing was just me at the end of a scene staring at a lamp and I said ‘I love lamp’ and [Ferrell] picked up on it and said, ‘You’re just saying things you’re looking at.'” “And we got paid to do it,” the actor quipped. “There was a budget and there were cameras, it was insane.” Christina Applegate, Paul Rudd and David Koechner also starred in the movie.

"Johnny Depp dropped from 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise, Disney producer confirms"	"Johnny Depp has been officially dropped from the ""Pirates of The Caribbean"" film series, it has been confirmed. A Disney producer said Depp, 55, will stop playing Captain Jack Sparrow after 14 years at the helm so the movies can have a reboot. ""We want to bring in a new energy and vitality,"" Disney's production chief Sean Bailey told The Hollywood Reporter. ""I love the [Pirates] movies, but part of the reason Paul and Rhett are so interesting is that we want to give it a kick in the pants. And that's what I've tasked them with."" Disney has met with Deadpool's writing duo Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick to pen the script for a reboot following their success with the superhero franchise. Johnny's last ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" was ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" in 2017, which was the lowest performing of the five films. Depp played the lead role in five films over 14 years and the series grossed more than $4.5 billion making it the 12th biggest franchise in movie history. Back in October scriptwriter Stuart Beattie appeared to confirm the news of Johnny's exit on ""DailyMail TV"" and revealed they will be reworking the entire franchise. Speaking about his exit, Stuart said: ""I think he's had a great run. Obviously, he's made that character his own and it's become the character he's most famous for now. ""And kids all over the world love him as that character so I think it's been great for him, it's been great for us, so I'm just very, very happy about it."" He added: ""I think Jack Sparrow will be his legacy. It's the only character he's played five times, it's the character he dresses up in to visit children in hospitals, it's what he'll be remembered for. ""Before Jack Sparrow came along, [Depp] was considered this kind of quirky, independent actor that made these really cool little Tim Burton films but he was by no means a movie star and a lot of people thought we were crazy for casting him at the time. ""Because he wasn't a proven commodity; you know, a big movie star. And we were making a big movie and we were putting this quirky, independent actor in the middle of it and people thought we were crazy. ""The fact that it worked is a miracle.

"Avengers,' 'Captain America' star Hayley Atwell nude photos hacked: report"	"Hackers claim to have posted naked photos of Hollywood star Hayley Atwell online. The British actress, 36, is apparently shown in a nude ""selfie"" shot on a seedy website that features leaked celebrity snaps. Other comments on the sick site are too graphic to print.

""In recent years she has hit the big time in Hollywood, so this is the last thing she will have wanted to happen.""

Spice Girls changing lyrics to be more politically correct for reunion tour	"The Spice Girls held fraught discussions over fears one of their iconic song lyrics is now politically incorrect. We can reveal ahead of their comeback tour next year the girlband — Mel B, Melanie C, Emma Bunton and Geri Horner — are in talks to change “yellow man in Timbuktu” from their No.1 hit ""Spice Up Your Life."" In particular, Mel B and Melanie C locked horns over whether the 1997 release should be tweaked, with the latter suggesting the line could become “happy people in Timbuktu.” A source said: “The original lyric was meant to be a bit of fun and never intended to be offensive. However, the world has moved on considerably since the song was released. “The reality is it’s not acceptable to say that now. Some of the girls feel uncomfortable getting up on stage and performing that lyric, especially when they have such a diverse and multicultural fanbase. “They pride themselves on standing for inclusivity, so they don’t want to run the risk of offending anybody.” The four-piece — minus Victoria Beckham — announced last month that they will be doing a reunion tour, with the first date at Cardiff’s Principality Stadium on May 27. Now the Wannabe hitmakers are assessing the rest of their back catalogue to ensure there aren’t any more insensitive lyrics. The source added: “In light of the #MeToo era, they are being extra-cautious. “They don’t want anything to overshadow their reunion for the wrong reasons.” And admittedly, there are some rather saucy lyrics the girls may not feel comfortable singing now they are all mums in their forties. For example, Mel B sings in ""First Time Lover"": “First bite whet my appetite, second helping’s always better, started getting burning hot.” While in ""2 Become 1,"" Emma sings about having safe sex with her partner: “Be a little bit wiser, Baby, put it on, put it on, ’cause tonight is the night, when two become one.” We can also reveal that the Spice Girls’ tour rehearsals are in jeopardy, after Mel B broke three ribs and needed a three-hour operation following a mystery accident earlier this month. A source added: “It is estimated she will take eight to 12 weeks to fully heal, which sets them back massively.” We hope Mel will be back in her platform boots in next to no time.

Kourtney Kardashian’s sexy Christmas pic totally failed	"Kourtney Kardashian’s fans have been left completely baffled by her “missing legs” in this sexy Instagram snap.

She captioned the snap: “So, I really love watches, and diamonds…a house on the beach?” Rather than answering her question, many of her 71 million followers demanded to know where her legs had gone. One of her fans joked, “Legs logged out,” while another demanded: “Where are your legs?” Another of Kourtney’s followers quipped: “She’s pretty but dang.

" New iPad Mini 5, 10-Inch iPad for 2019, report says"	"Apple hasn't updated the iPad mini since 2015, when it first released the fourth-generation model, so it stands to reason the Cupertino tech giant will probably give its smallest tablet a refresh soon. A Thursday report out of China backs up that assumption. As MacRumors reports, supply chain sources told the China Times that Apple is gearing up to launch a fifth-gen iPad mini in the first half of 2019. Last year, Apple gave the 7.9-inch iPad mini 4 a spec-boost, upping its storage from 32GB to 128GB. Many will likely be unwrapping that model for Christmas as Walmart was selling it for just $279, down from $399, on Cyber Monday. The fifth-gen version, which people are calling the iPad mini 5, will feature an upgraded processor and cheaper display panel, respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in October. Also reportedly on tap for next year is a new, entry-level 10-inch iPad. That model may replace the sixth-gen 9.7-inch iPad released this March, which starts at $329. China Times says the upcoming 10-inch iPad will sport a ""narrower frame"" than its predecessor and a similar price, according to MacRumors. It's expected to debut in the second half of 2019. As for what actually comes to pass remains to be seen. The sixth-gen iPad earned an ""excellent"" review in PCMag's April review, and our coveted Editors' Choice award. ""The same price as last year's model but now with Apple Pencil support, the sixth-generation iPad is the best midrange tablet choice for most people,"" PCMag' Lead Mobile Analyst Sascha Segan wrote in the review."	nonTerrorism	Tech
One step to protect your online accounts from hackers and scammers	"It was bound to happen: Two-factor authentication (2FA) – that extra step that’s supposed to keep our devices and personal information safe – just no longer cuts it. The idea behind 2FA is simple: You log into a given account using your username and password from a new browser, location or device, and you get second authentication request, like a text with a temporary PIN. You enter this temporary code and voila – you’re in. Because most hackers can’t access your phone, your account should be safe. Your Facebook and LinkedIn accounts already should have 2FA set up. If not, learn how to set up 2FA on your most popular accounts using my step-by-step guide. Technology is always evolving, and cybercriminals have found flaws in the 2FA system – especially if you’re using your personal phone. Hackers are finding ingenious ways to hijack phone numbers. Wonder how criminals pull it off? I have the scoop on SIM card swaps that is fascinating. I’ve got steps you can follow to create a secondary number that directs calls and texts to your primary cell phone. Secondary numbers are common among freelancers and small business owners, who don’t necessarily want to carry around multiple phones. When you are setting up 2FA, your secondary number keeps your primary phone number safe. If you lose your personal phone, switch carriers or your number gets compromised, your secondary number will remain separate and your 2FA texts will still be accessible via a web browser or another phone. Google Voice gives you a free phone number for voice calls, texts and voicemail. All you need is an active Google account. Learn how to use Google Voice with my insider tips. Here's how you set up a Google Voice number: 1. Install the Google Voice app, available for iOS and Android. You can also access Google Voice on your computer via a web browser. 3. After linking, the app will prompt you to choose a Google Voice number. You can search for available numbers by ZIP code or city, but you’re probably better off taking what they suggest. (I couldn’t get a Google Voice number in my home state of Arizona; the nearest available numbers on the day I set this up were in California and Iowa.) 4. After choosing your Google Voice number, you are required to link and verify your account to an active cell phone number. All your Google Voice calls and text messages can be forwarded to this number, too. However, if you’re going to use the Google Voice number for 2FA, you’ll need to go back and disable call forwarding. You can’t use Google Voice for both 2FA and to receive calls and texts. It’s an either-or thing. 5. Google will then send a six-digit code to your linked phone number to verify your Google Voice account. Enter this code and make sure they match. 6. That's it. You're set to use your Google Voice phone number. From now on, instead of using your own phone number for that second level of identity verification, you can use your Google Voice number instead. There's one downside to this method. Since your Google Voice number is tied to your Google account, if hackers manage to compromise your Google account, you're actually back to square one because they'll also have access to your 2FA codes. Another secure option: Use an authenticator app In many ways, authenticator apps are much easier and more secure than a text message. They are specifically designed to help with two-factor authentication, and services like Google Authenticator can protect your login and minimize your exposure to hackers. Google users are especially encouraged to use an authenticator app for your 2FA codes. In addition to Google Authenticator, you can use other authentication apps like Duo, Authy, Microsoft, LastPass or FreeOTP. The instructions on how to set up and use Google Authenticator are on my site. Beside 2FA security, it's almost a necessity to have multiple numbers so you don’t have to give out your personal number. Whether you’re online dating, buying and selling on Craigslist, or traveling, it's smart to have a secondary number to give out. Using the right app on your smartphone, you can have multiple lines and phone numbers on a single phone. These apps can give you a secondary number for as long as you need it.

 How arrest of Chinese ‘princess’ exposes regime’s world domination plot	"Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou’s arrest in Vancouver on Dec. 6 led to immediate blowback. Furious Chinese Communists have begun arresting innocent Canadians in retaliation. So far, three of these “revenge hostages” have been taken and are being held in secret jails on vague charges. Beijing hints that the hostage count may grow if Meng is not freed and fast. Even for a thuggish regime like China’s, this kind of action is almost unprecedented. So who is Meng Wanzhou? Currently under house arrest and awaiting extradition to the US, she will face charges that her company violated US sanctions by doing business with Iran and committed bank fraud by disguising the payments it received in return. But to say that she is the CFO of Huawei doesn’t begin to explain her importance — or China’s reaction. It turns out that “Princess” Meng, as she is called, is Communist royalty. Her grandfather was a close comrade of Chairman Mao during the Chinese Civil War, who went on to become vice governor of China’s largest province. She is also the daughter of Huawei’s Founder and Chairman, Ren Zhengfei. Daddy is grooming her to succeed him when he retires. In other words, Meng is the heiress apparent of China’s largest and most advanced hi-tech company, and one which plays a key role in China’s grand strategy of global domination. Huawei is a leader in 5G technology and, earlier this year, surpassed Apple to become the second largest smartphone maker in the world behind Samsung. But Huawei is much more than an innocent manufacturer of smartphones. It is a spy agency of the Chinese Communist Party. How do we know? Because the party has repeatedly said so. First in 2015 and then again in June 2017, the party declared that all Chinese companies must collaborate in gathering intelligence. “All organizations and citizens,” reads Article 7 of China’s National Intelligence Law, “must support, assist with, and collaborate in national intelligence work, and guard the national intelligence work secrets they are privy to.” All Chinese companies, whether they are private or owned by the state, are now part and parcel of the party’s massive overseas espionage campaign. Huawei is a key part of this aggressive effort to spy on the rest of the world. The company’s smartphones, according to FBI Director Christopher Wray, can be used to “maliciously modify or steal information,” as well as “conduct undetected espionage.” Earlier this year the Pentagon banned the devices from all US military bases worldwide. But Huawei, which has been specially designated as a “national champion,” has an even more important assignment from the Communist Party than simply listening in on phone conversations. As a global leader in 5G technology, it has been tasked with installing 5G “fiber to the phone” networks in countries around the world. In fact, “Made in China 2025” — the party’s aggressive plan to dominate the cutting-edge technologies of the 21st century — singles out Huawei as the key to achieving global 5G dominance. Any network system installed by a company working hand-in-glove with China’s intelligence services raises the danger of not only cyber espionage, but also cyber-enabled technology theft. And the danger doesn’t stop there. The new superfast 5G networks, which are 100 times faster than 4G, will literally run the world of the future. Everything from smartphones to smart cities, from self-driving vehicles to, yes, even weapons systems, will be under their control. In other words, whoever controls the 5G networks will control the world — or at least large parts of it. Huawei has reportedly secured more than 25 commercial contracts for 5G, but has been locked out of an increasing number of countries around the world because of spying concerns. The “Five Eyes” — Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and the US — have over the past year waged a concerted campaign to block the Chinese tech giant from dominating next-generation wireless networks around the world. Not only have they largely kept Huawei out of their own countries, they have convinced other countries like Japan, India and Germany to go along, too. Whoever controls the 5G networks will control the world — or at least large parts of it. Yet Huawei is far from finished. The company has grown into a global brand over the past two decades because, as a “national champion,” it is constantly being fed and nourished by the party and the military with low-interest-rate loans, privileged access to a protected domestic market, and other preferential treatment. These various state subsidies continue, giving Huawei a huge and unfair advantage over its free market competitors. Huawei stands in the same relationship to the Chinese Communist Party as German steelmaker Alfried Krupp did to Germany’s National Socialists in the days leading up to WWII. Just as Germany’s leading supplier of armaments basically became an arm of the Nazi machine after war broke out, so is China’s leading hi-tech company an essential element of the party’s cold war plan to dominate the world of the future. As far as “Princess” Meng is concerned, I expect that she will be found guilty of committing bank fraud, ordered to pay a fine, and then released. Even a billion dollar fine would be chump change for a seventy-five-billion-dollar corporation like Huawei. The real payoff of her arrest lies elsewhere. It has exposed the massive campaign of espionage that Huawei is carrying out around the world at the behest of the Party. It has revealed how that Party dreams of a new world order in which China, not America, is dominant. The two Chinese characters that make up Huawei’s name literally mean, “To Serve China.” That’s clear enough, isn’t it? Steven W. Mosher is the President of the Population Research Institute and the author of “Bully of Asia: Why China’s Dream is the New Threat to World Order.” Writer Steven W.

Kansas trying to unload $10M in computer equipment after abandoning costly tech project	" The administration of Kansas Gov. Jeff Colyer is trying to unload $10 million worth of computer equipment by selling it at a steep discount or donating it. The state still owes $2 million for the equipment, which has been stored in a state office building since 2016. It was intended to be used to develop a centralized storage system called GovCloud. The project was halted when state technology officials said it would be too expensive. The state now contracts it information storage needs with an outside company. Sale of the equipment has thus far failed to attract buyers. The Topeka Capital-Journal reported that discussions have been had about finding a buyer before the equipment’s value decreases to the level of scrap metal. Democratic state Sen. Tom Holland said selling the equipment for less than its value or donating it are fine solutions. “The point is, equipment after a while just becomes obsolete. If somebody can use it, great. If you can get some money out of it, fine,” Holland said. The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Tech
2018 year in review: Smartphone notches were all the rage	"2018 could be called the year of the notch, as major phone makers followed in Apple’s footsteps by inserting a cutout at the top of the display. The notch enables slimmer display borders and features like Face ID on the new iPhones and a dual selfie camera system on Google’s Pixel 3 XL. Reception has been mixed. But if you prefer a phone without the notch, your choices are limited – at least among the best smartphone picks. HOW TO STOP APPLE AND GOOGLE FROM TRACKING YOU Fox News has compiled a list of five of the best. The Pixel phone line was first introduced just a little more than two years ago. The third generation Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL (the latter now with a notch) are among the best smartphones on the planet. Innovative features such as Night Sight, which allows you to take detailed and bright night photos, push it to the top of the pack. There’s also Call Screen, which uses artificial intelligence to answer calls for you then allows you to block the calls based on a real-time transcript of the conversation. And Google Assistant is the best use of AI out there. The notch on the larger Pixel 3 XL houses dual speakers in addition to the dual selfie cameras. The aforementioned features should put both phones at the top of your list. The 5.5-inch Pixel 3 starts at $799, 6.3-inch Pixel 3 XL at $899. Apple’s cheaper version of the iPhone XS is the best value for most consumers. You get Face ID, fast performance, wireless charging, a good LCD display, and extra color options like yellow and blue. You’ll take a hit on the rear camera, which is a single camera compared to the dual on the more expensive iPhone XS. But it’s the best bang for the buck. The more expensive iPhone XS is also one of 2018’s standouts. This is a more compact, lighter phone than the XR and boasts a better dual camera system with optical zoom, a higher-quality OLED display, extra water resistance, and stainless-steel sides. HERE'S HOW TO BLOCK ROBOCALLS ON IPHONE AND ANDROID One of the few leading phones without a notch, the Galaxy Note 9 is a no-brainer as one of the best phones in 2018, along with its siblings the Galaxy S9 and S9+. The Note 9's S Pen is now a remote-control device for taking selfies, shuffling music or flipping through presentations. The Note 9 also offers a good camera with a new AI feature that can automatically recognize different kinds of scenes and adjust the settings accordingly. Other highlights include better placement of the fingerprint sensor and one of the best OLED displays in the business. The only downside is, there aren’t any really huge changes from the Note 8, which looks very similar to the Note 9. The 6.4-inch Note 9 starts at $999. This is one of the best budget phones of 2018. It comes with a good dual camera system on the back, a sleek design, fast charging, good battery life, a sizable 5.7-inch display, and slim bezels. The phone typically starts at $199 or less at retailers."	nonTerrorism	Tech
"Scrub Facebook, best weather apps and more: Tech Q&A"	"Q: Can you trust the Apple Watch ECG readings? I am concerned about my heart. My dad had a heart attack at my age! A: You are wise to question a wristwatch that can accurately measure your cardio data. This is your heart we’re talking about – an essential organ in your body. The ECG is a brand-new Apple Watch 4 feature and only has “FDA clearance,” which is different from FDA approval. So obviously the ECG in your watch doesn’t compare to the one in a hospital. But can you still trust it? Listen to my 60-second take on the Apple Watch 4 ECG reliability. Q: I am looking for a new job and don’t want potential employers to see anything bad on my Facebook account. How can I come across squeaky clean and not the party animal that I am? A: Wasn’t it fun to post that funny picture of you and your friends dressed in lederhosen knocking back giant glasses of beer at Oktoberfest? One thoughtless rant from years ago could come back to haunt you. Your Facebook wall is a minefield of social liability, and every photo, GIF, and comment can be scrutinized for evidence of your moral failings. So how do you dig up those virtual indiscretions? Use this free download to clean up your social media profile. Q: My daughter just got her learner’s permit. With winter here, I want to know up-to-the-minute driving conditions. Any recommendations? A: Lots of people are content with the weather feature they have on their phones, or just looking up the forecast on Google. They live in consistent climates, where it’s cold in the winter, it always rains at 2 p.m., or it’s dry all year, so there’s no urgent reason to check weather patterns. For those of us who prefer to know the exact temperature, the precise hours of precipitation, and the expected humidity of our location, there are many weather apps competing to be the most accurate meteorological oracle. Only a handful really stand out. I put together this list of the best weather apps. See the Menu in Dark Restaurants Q: Is there an app that will help me read the menu in dark restaurants? I use the flashlight, but the menu fonts are always so small. A: I have a pet peeve about restaurants that are so dark you can’t even see the people you’re having dinner with; there’s a difference between “romantic” and “cavernous” lighting. As someone who has sight issues, I am especially sensitive to environments that are hard on the eyes. But to answer your question, you don’t necessarily need an app; if you have an iPhone, one simple feature will transform you from a squinting customer to Sherlock Holmes. Use this tip to turn your phone into a magnifying glass. Q: Make the robocalls stop! There must be a way! Help! A: Compared to robocalls, the telemarketers of yore are almost quaint. Worse yet, robocalls may be con-men in disguise, who farm for personal information (or record your voice) to steal your identity. Whether they're annoying or malevolent, there’s never a reason you should have to field another robocall again in your life. So how do you terminate them forever? Use these awesome apps that block unwanted robocalls. What digital lifestyle questions do you have? Call Kim’s national radio show and tap or click here to find it on your local radio station.

‘Aging’ 911 systems slowly begin to see video and text upgrades	"FAYETTEVILLE, Ga. — “Is that the patient right there?” asked Camri Copeland, a communications officer. Right there. Copeland could actually see the scene of a car crash from an emergency communications center in Fayette County, Ga. through one of the nation’s first video livestreaming 911 calls. The video helped pinpoint exactly where the vehicles were, as first responders headed to the scene. “You get a better understanding of what’s going on out there,” Copeland, less than two years into the job, told Fox News. “You use your eyes and ears, so it’s just the benefit of being able to see what [the 911 callers] probably don’t see.” International company, Carbyne, brought the technology to the U.S. earlier this year. It has rolled out video and texting options at six public safety answering points (PSAPs) so far, with three more on the way. The technology comes amid a wake of criticism over the country's aging 911 systems, which celebrated its 50th anniversary this year. The past two decades, as wireless technology has rapidly advanced, experts have questioned why America's most crucial communication system continues to struggle to keep pace. Apps like Uber and Facebook can locate mobile users immediately, but many 911 centers still have a tough time finding wireless callers who don't know their location -- and, in emergencies, just seconds can make a difference between life and death. “Right now, the communications habits and preferences of America are changing so quickly away from voice calls,” said Dan Henry, director of government affairs with the National Emergency Number Association. “It’s really crucial that 911 keeps up with those advances or else it risks becoming irrelevant.” Local governments pay for 911 centers, which has led to a “patchwork implementation” of technology, according to Henry. So while one county may have the latest equipment -- with text and video capabilities -- a nearby county or municipality could have aging technology that impedes its ability to immediately locate a caller. About 80 percent of 911 calls are made from cell phones. A bill currently before Congress – that will likely be reintroduced next session – is aimed at accelerating upgrades nationwide with additional federal grants. A recent report to Congress revealed the estimated cost of NG911 deployment, which would transition PSAPs to an Internet Protocol-based 911 system, allowing for a smoother flow of digital information, is between $9.5 and 12.7 billion. The problem is that, because of outdated technology, a 911 call from a wireless phone does not provide the 911 operator with the precise location -- the call is pinged to a cell phone tower, which gives the call center a vague sense of where the caller is. Brian Fontes, CEO of the National Emergency Number Association, a group that promotes technological improvements in 911 systems nationwide, said that the inability to keep pace with fast-changing technology is hurting everyone. “[A] First-first responder is in a world of hurt,” Fontes said. “Much of 911 today is stuck in last-century technology...Could you imagine yourself talking only in a voice channel?” Less than one-third of PSAPs offer text-to-911 as an option and even less offer video, according to the FCC. But there are some municipalities on the cutting edge of technology. When residents dial 911 in Fayette County, communications officers can send a link to the caller’s phone, which enables video live streaming or texting. Interim director of Fayette County 911, Kayte Vogt, called it a comfort factor. “They realize that I know exactly where they are,” she said. Residents can also go through Carbyne’s app for video, text and improved location detection capabilities. Melissa Alterio works north of Atlanta, where residents can text 911 directly. She heralded the technology, pointing to a case where a call-taker was able to give medical advice via text to someone who was having trouble breathing, thus didn’t want to talk on the phone. While Alterio sees how text and video can provide call-takers more immediate information, she questions if there’s such a thing as providing too much information. “We experience trauma just talking to somebody on the phone through their worst crisis,” Alterio told Fox News. “But once we start seeing graphic images…we’re very concerned about the trauma that that’s going to have on the 911 professionals.” “We recognize that video has the potential to do amazing things, but it also risks adding trauma for call-takers,” Amir Elichai, founder of Carbyne, wrote in an email to Fox News. Elichai, a former Israeli Army officer, said this area of concern still needs to be researched. But, in the meantime, the technology provides the option for the communications officer to turn off the video. For Copeland, who comes from a family in the police force, she said it is all part of what she signed up for. “It’s kind of a ‘do your job’ situation.”"	nonTerrorism	Tech
 Former NASA engineer admits 'glitter bomb' video was partially fake	"The former NASA engineer whose ""glitter bomb"" video went viral earlier in the week admitted it was partially fraudulent.

Apple doesn’t see a problem with bent iPads	"Apple says consumers shouldn’t be getting so bent out of shape about the new iPad Pros. Apple confirmed to The Verge that its 2018 iPad Pros have been shipping with a bend in the aluminum chassis. The company says the bend is not a defect, but rather a byproduct of the manufacturing process, which involves cooling the tablet’s metal and plastic components. Apple claims the bend shouldn’t affect device performance, but the news about the iPads — which range from $799 to $1,899 — has angered some consumers. “I would probably be considered an ‘Apple cult member’ by many people, but releasing a product with a manufacturing flaw and then throwing your hands up and saying it’s unavoidable is a chickens–t move,” wrote one fed up Reddit user. One disgruntled customer told the Post that managers at an Australian Apple Store referred to his bent iPad as having “cosmetic damage” and dismissed online reports about the issue. Other users have voiced concern that the bend actually occurs over time from normal daily pressure. Last month, a viral video from YouTuber JerryRigEverything ignited “Bendgate 2.0” by showing the newest iPad Pro being bent in half under very little force. The video reminded some of Apple’s original “Bendgate” in 2014 when consumers complained that their iPhone 6’s were warping in their pockets.

"Amazon sent over 1,000 private Alexa recordings to random person"	"Amazon’s virtual assistant, Alexa, allowed a user in Germany to get access to more than 1,000 recordings from another user — thanks to a “human error” by the tech giant, according to a report. The unidentified user had asked the voice assistant to play back recordings of his own activities made by Alexa, and in doing so, he was able to get 1,700 audio files from a complete stranger after Amazon sent him a link, the German computer magazine c’t reported. An Amazon spokesman said Thursday: “This unfortunate case was the result of a human error and an isolated single case.” The person who received the stranger’s recordings claimed he initially got no reply from Amazon when the user informed the company that he was given the wrong files. The audio files were then deleted from a link provided by Amazon, but the person had already downloaded them on a computer. A man and woman could be overheard conversing on the recordings, according to c’t. “We resolved the issue with the two customers involved and took measures to further optimize our processes. As a precautionary measure we contacted the relevant authorities,” the Amazon spokesman said. This story originally appeared in the New York Post."	nonTerrorism	Tech
 Court forces Apple to stop selling older iPhones in Germany	"Apple will reportedly stop selling older iPhones in Germany after a local court ruled that the company's products had infringed on a Qualcomm patent. Apple will pull iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 models from the company's 15 retail stores in Germany, the company told Reuters. ""We are of course disappointed by this verdict and we plan to appeal,"" Apple said. On Thursday, a district court in Munich ruled that the iPhones models infringed on a Qualcomm patent dealing with a smartphone power-saving feature. As a result, the court granted Qualcomm's request for an injunction against the affected models. The ban marks the second court victory for Qualcomm in its patent battle with Apple, which threatens the sale of iPhones in certain markets across the world. Earlier this month, a court in China also ruled in favor of Qualcomm and granted an injunction against Apple, barring the sale of certain iPhone models. ""Two respected courts in two different jurisdictions just in the past two weeks have now confirmed the value of Qualcomm's patents and declared Apple an infringer, ordering a ban on iPhones in the important markets of Germany and China,"" Qualcomm's general counsel Don Rosenberg said in a statement. According to Reuters, the affected iPhone models sold in Germany have been using chips from an Apple supplier called Qorvo, which the court ruled was at fault for violating Qualcomm's patent on the power-saving feature. Qualcomm told PCMag today's court ruling also applies to Apple's ""European Union entities."" It also means Apple must pay monetary damages, which will be determined at a later date. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. But the court losses in Germany and China haven't affected the company's newest iPhones, the XS and XR. Apple has also downplayed the impact of the court ruling in China, saying the court-enforced ban only applies to iPhones running iOS 11, not iOS 12. As a result, the company continues to sell all iPhones models in the country after rolling out a software update to iPhones in China that'll prevent the devices from infringing on the Qualcomm patents in question. Nevertheless, Qualcomm continues to wage its legal battle against Apple and has been seeking a court injunction in China to get the company's newest iPhones also banned over patent infringement."	nonTerrorism	Tech
"Your iPad Pro may come with a bend, but Apple says it's fine"	" If you decide to buy an iPad Pro, it may come with a slight bend in the metal casing, whether you like it or not. On Wednesday, Apple reportedly said that some units of the 2018 iPad Pro may ship with a curve in the aluminum chassis. But it isn't a defect, at least according to the company. Apple told The Verge that the minor bend is due to a cooling process involving the iPad Pro's metal and plastic components when the hardware is being manufactured. However, the company says the slightly warped chassis won't affect the iPad's performance. The news comes as some iPad Pro customers have been complaining that their devices came sold with a minor curve in the aluminum casing. As proof, people have been posting photos of their bent iPads over on social media and on MacRumor's forum. ""I've treated this thing like a baby, never in a bag, carried everywhere, and keyboard case from day 1,"" wrote one customer who reported later noticing the iPad's bent casing. It isn't clear if Apple's going to reverse course and offer free refunds for anyone who owns an iPad with a bend. The company didn't immediately respond to a request for a comment. But no customer is probably going to be happy with a slightly warped iPad Pro. The 11-inch device starts at $799, while the 12.9-inch model can go for $999 and up.

"Facebook blasted by privacy advocates, lawmakers over data-sharing agreements"	" Facebook drew widespread, scathing criticism from privacy advocates and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic on Thursday for not disclosing the extent of its wide-ranging data-sharing deals that gave other tech firms access to private user data and information. The world's largest social network is reeling from a massive New York Times investigation that examined more than 150 agreements Facebook had with partners including Apple, Netflix, Spotify and Amazon, to allow the companies to access users' names, contact information and private messages. In a second blog post responding to the outcry, Facebook said these agreements were publicly discussed and available when users logged into the other services with Facebook. Some of the agreements date back to the platform's early years. The company's mea culpa and bullet-pointed explanations have not stopped the growing calls for federal privacy regulation or penalties via the ongoing Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigation. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""It's time that Congress got serious about protecting the privacy, the data, the personal confidential information of hundreds of millions of Americans,"" said Josh Hawley, U.S. Senator-elect from Missouri, on Fox News' Tucker Carlson Tonight. ""[Facebook] said they would not share personal, private confidential data of users without the users' consent. It looks like that's exactly what Facebook is doing, though, that they are sharing that data in order to make a profit without users' consent."" Hawley, a Republican and constitutional lawyer, also called on the FTC to examine whether the latest revelations put the tech giant in violation of the consent decree that the tech giant signed in 2011. Facebook has denied that the data-sharing arrangements violate the 2011 consent decree, but privacy advocates have said the Menlo Park, Calif., company is likely in violation of its terms. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said the FTC's probe is moving at a ""snail's pace"" and ""becoming a bad joke."" ""Congress must act promptly & powerfully next session with a strong privacy protection law that will protect against such intrusive, abusive misuse of consumer information,"" Blumenthal said in a statement on Twitter. ""Hoping for renewed Commerce Committee hearings in early January!"" Privacy advocates said Facebook no longer deserves the trust of its 2.2 billion users, whose constant sharing on the platform fueled the company's $13.7 billion third-quarter revenue. ""We are particularly troubled the Times' new report that Facebook is undermining user privacy by misinterpreting the term ""service provider,"" which is an exception to the privacy rules in the FTC's 2011 consent order,"" the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a nonprofit digital rights organization, said in a blog post. According to the EFF, many data privacy rules limit the transfer of personal data from one company to another because such arrangements can increase the risk of theft by hackers or misuse by employees, and other uses that consumers could not anticipate. But the privacy rules often exempt so-called service providers. ""A company might not be required to get consent before storing consumers' data with a third-party data storage service, provided the storage service does nothing with the data except store it,"" the nonprofit said. The EFF said it is ""alarmed"" by how Facebook's privacy director, Stephen Satterfield, interprets the ""service provider"" exception, as detailed in the Times story: With most of the partnerships, Mr. Satterfield said, the F.T.C. agreement did not require the social network to secure users’ consent before sharing data because Facebook considered the partners extensions of itself — service providers that allowed users to interact with their Facebook friends. The partners were prohibited from using the personal information for other purposes, he said. ""To the contrary, the kinds of company-to-company data sharing described in the new Times article do not fall within any reasonable definition of 'service provider,'"" the EFF said. “Every single time that you share something on Facebook or one of our services, right there is a control in line where you control who you want to share with,” Zuckerberg told the US Congress earlier this year. This is a lie,"" wrote Siva Vaidhyanathan, professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, in a Guardian op-ed. Kate Crawford, the co-founder of the AI Now Institute at New York University, said the New York Times investigation exposes that user control of data online is a myth. ""The total lack of respect for user wishes is the infinitely repeating scandal of 2018,"" Crawford added. David Cicilline, D-R.I., tweeted: ""Zuckerberg told Congress that Facebook users had “complete control” over their data. Sure looks like he lied."" Amid the data-sharing fallout, Facebook's shares dropped over 7 percent and are down about 24 percent for the year. In addition, the Association of National Advertisers on Tuesday said the FTC should advocate for a new federal law governing how all advertisers collect and use consumer data, as a way to pre-empt regulation by individual states. ""Based on these revelations, I’m concerned that Facebook may have provided @EnergyCommerce with inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading responses to our questions, and we’ll be following up,"" said New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, a Democrat, on Twitter. Facebook, which previously provided an explanation of the data-sharing agreements in a blog post, is still grappling with fallout from Cambridge Analytica, in which a data-mining firm was allowed to access the information of up to 87 million users. On Wednesday, D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine filed a lawsuit, which could potentially be joined by other states' attorneys general, alleging that Mark Zuckerberg's company told users that it would protect their personal information, but allowed the developer of a personality quiz app to collect and sell the data of users who hadn't downloaded or used the app. Damian Collins, chair of the United Kingdom's powerful Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, which has been probing Facebook's actions in relation to the spread of disinformation, said that Facebook should appear before the committee to explain its data policies. ""We have to seriously challenge the claim by Facebook that they are not selling user data. They may not be letting people take it away by the bucket load, but they do reward companies with access to data that others are denied, if they place a high value on the business they do together,"" Collins said in a statement. ""I feel that we have been given misleading responses by the company when we have asked these questions during previous evidence sessions."" In his appearance on Tucker Carlson Tonight, Sen. Hawley suggested a broader inquiry into Big Tech might be needed. ""I think it's time we looked at the effect big tech is having on our personal lives, on our families, on our schools, on our society. These are major companies. Many of them monopolies. They make billions of dollars a year. There've never been more powerful companies in the history of the world, and they need to be held accountable,"" the Missouri senator said. New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood told the Times through a spokesperson that her office, which is already investigating Facebook, would also examine the newly revealed data-sharing partnerships as part of that probe."	nonTerrorism	Tech
 Pentagon F-35 vs A-10 close air support evaluation hits next phase	"The Pentagon-led F-35 vs. A-10 Close Air Support assessment is nearing its next phase of evaluation, following an initial “first wave” of tests in July of this year -- designed to test which of the two aircraft might be best suited to confront heavy enemy fire when performing high-risk CAS missions. “Mission performance is under evaluation,” Vice Adm. Mat Winter, Program Executive Officer, F-35 program, told reporters earlier this year. Pre- Initial Operational Test & Evaluation test phases are currently underway at Edwards AFB and Naval Air Station China Lake, officials said. “Mission performance is being evaluated in the presence of a robust set of ground threats and, to ensure a fair and comparable evaluation of each system’s performance, both aircraft are allowed to configure their best weapons loadouts and employ their best tactics for the mission scenario” a statement from the Director, Operational Test & Evaluation said. Long-revered by ground troops as a “flying-tank,” the combat-proven A-10 has been indispensable to ground-war victory. Its titanium hull, 30mm cannon, durability, built-in redundancy and weapons range has enabled the aircraft to sustain large amounts of small arms fire and combat damage - and keep flying. At the same time, as newer threats emerge and the high-tech F-35 matures into combat, many US military weapons developers and combatant commanders believe the JSF can bring an improved, new-generation of CAS support to ground troops. Thus - the ongoing Office of the Secretary of Defense comparison. Upon initial examination, some might regard a stealthy, 5th-Gen F-35 as ill-equipped or at least not-suited for close air support. However, a closer look does seem to uncover a handful of advantages. Long-range, computer-enabled F-35 sensors could enable the aircraft to see and destroy enemy ground targets with precision from much higher altitudes and much farther ranges than an A-10 could; the speed of an F-35, when compared to an A-10, would potentially make it better able to maneuver, elude enemy fire and get into position for attack; like the A-10s 30mm gun, the F-35 has its own 25mm cannon mounted on its left wing which could attack ground forces; given its sensor configuration, with things like a 360-degree Distributed Aperture System with cameras, the F-35 brings a drone-like ISR component to air-ground war. This could help targeting, terrain analysis and much-needed precision attacks as US soldiers fight up close with maneuvering enemy ground forces. An F-35 might be better positioned to respond quickly to enemy force movement; in the event that enemy air threats emerge in a firefight, an F-35 could address them in a way an A-10 could not, obviously; an F-35 would be much better positioned to locate enemy long-range fires points of combat significance and destroy hostile artillery, mortar or long-range-fires launching points. Finally, while the A-10 has a surprisingly wide envelope of weapons, an F-35 could travel with a wider range of air-ground attack weapons - armed with advanced targeting technology. Also, fighter-jet close air support is by no means unprecedented. F-22s were used against ISIS, F-15s were used against insurgents in Iraq - and the F-35 recently had its combat debut in Afghanistan. There are, however, some unknowns likely to be informing the current analysis. How much small arms fire could an F-35 withstand? Could it draw upon its “hovering” technology to loiter near high-value target areas? To what extent could it keep flying in the event that major components, such as engines or fuselage components, were destroyed in war? How much could A-10 weapons and targeting technology be upgraded? Regardless of the conclusions arrived upon by the ongoing assessment, it is likely both the A-10 and F-35 will perform CAS missions in the immediate years ahead. While the Army's reverence for the A-10 is a long-established fact, the service does also seem to like the F-35 for Close Air Support as well. “When you are in a firefight, the first thing infantry wants to do it get on that radio to adjust fire for mortars and locate targets with close air support with planes or helicopters. You want fires. The F-35 has increased survivability and it will play a decisive role in the support of ground combat,” Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley told reporters at the Association of the United States Army Annual Symposium in October. More Weapons and Technology -WARRIORMAVEN (CLICK HERE)"	nonTerrorism	Tech
Feds take down 15 DDoS-for-hire websites	"Federal investigators have taken down a pack of ""DDoS-for-hire"" services that let buyers knock websites offline for a price. On Thursday, the US Department of Justice announced it had seized 15 web domains that were selling access to DDoS attacks, but under the guise of network stress-testing services. The seized domains include critical-boot.com, ragebooter.com, downthem.org and quantumstress.net. In addition, Justice Department has charged three suspects for running two of the DDoS-for-services named. The services worked by offering customers the ability to launch what's a distributed denial-of-service or DDoS attack, which can overwhelm a website with too much internet traffic, forcing it temporarily offline. Buyers could pay as little as a few dollars a month to $50 or more to gain access to the hacking services, depending on the volume of the attack they wished to launch. Gamers like to buy such services to take down opponents in multiplayer games. However, federal investigators claim the 15 DDoS-for-services taken down on Thursday were also used to disrupt access to online platforms from financial institutions, universities, and governments. At least a few of the platforms also had thousands of customers. ""Between October 2014 and November 2018, Downthem's database showed over 2000 customer subscriptions, and had been used to conduct, or attempt to conduct, over 200,000 DDoS attacks,"" the Justice Department said. Quantumstress.net, on the other hand, had more than 80,000 customer subscriptions dating back to when the service was first launched in 2012. The FBI is now warning it intends to go after both operators and buyers of such DDoS-for-hire services. ""Whether you launch the DDoS attack or hire a DDoS service to do it for you, the FBI considers it criminal activity,"" said FBI assistant director Matthew Gorham. ""Working with our industry and law enforcement partners, the FBI will identify and potentially prosecute you for this activity."""	nonTerrorism	Tech
Apple enables iOS in-app purchase gifting	"Apple is adding a new gifting option for iOS apps that embraces in-app purchases as content you'd want to gift to someone else. Right now, you can gift a paid app to a friend, but you can't gift any paid content within that app to others. That's changing. As MacRumors reports, an update to the App Store Review Guidelines changes the gifting rules. The old guidelines stated ""Apps should not directly or indirectly enable gifting of in-app purchase content, features, or consumable items to others."" However, the new version now reads, ""Apps may enable gifting of items that are eligible for in-app purchase to others. Such gifts may only be refunded to the original purchaser and may not be exchanged."" Why make this change? The most likely reason is the way in which purchasing content is changing on the App Store. A growing number of apps are offered for free with content purchased after you've started using the app, the so-called free-to-try model. Then there's subscriptions, which charge the user regularly, but also offer additional content through in-app purchases. While the rules have changed, we will need to wait and see in-app content gifting in action. Apple first needs to decide how to tackle it from within each app before developers embrace it. It seems likely to be popular with developers as it adds to the ways their apps can generate more revenue, but will users be enthusiastic about gifting content from within apps?"	nonTerrorism	Tech
Facebook under fire for peddling your private messages – and isn't sorry	"The company has been the target of so much scrutiny, so many investigations, that it's difficult for anyone to keep track. And we've all become accustomed, maybe inured, to all the explanations, justifications and belated apologies from Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg. But an investigative piece in yesterday's New York Times involves a very different kind of ethical breach — one that critics say rises to outright betrayal. Facebook is merchandizing access to your private messages. That is like a gut punch — the one area on the post-everything site where its more than 2 billion users felt assured they had absolute privacy. And yet, documents obtained by the Times show the company granted Netflix and Spotify the ability to read confidential messages. Never mind that you might have been writing about sensitive financial matters or emotional issues, or didn't want anyone to know about your relationship with that person. Facebook didn't care. Zuckerberg and company ""allowed Spotify, Netflix and the Royal Bank of Canada to read, write and delete users' private messages, and to see all participants on a thread — privileges that appeared to go beyond what the companies needed to integrate Facebook into their systems ... Spokespeople for Spotify and Netflix said those companies were unaware of the broad powers Facebook had granted them."" Facebook privacy chief Steve Satterfield is quoted as saying the company didn't violate anyone's privacy. He conceded that ""we know we've got work to do to regain people's trust."" But no apology from Zuckerberg, Sandberg or the company itself. Other deals: Facebook let Microsoft's Bing search engine see the names of nearly all Facebook users' friends without their consent. Yahoo was allowed to ""view streams of friends' posts as recently as this summer, despite public statements that it had stopped that type of sharing years earlier."" Even the newspaper itself: ""The Times — one of nine media companies named in the documents — had access to users' friend lists for an article-sharing application it had discontinued in 2011."" Experts, including a former Federal Trade Commission, said the deals appeared to violate a consent decree signed by Facebook after a privacy suit by the agency. This comes on the heels of a Senate report charging that Facebook (along with Twitter and Google) withheld information from the government about the extent of Russian infiltration. Given the endless waves of Russian propaganda and disinformation, perhaps there was a little public sympathy for the challenge of trying to police such a massive operation. But the Facebook privacy infringements are a self-inflicted wound. They reflect an insatiable drive for profits that goes well beyond the bargain we all make in allowing our public information to be marketed to advertisers. It's a bargain that some prominent people are now abandoning. Walt Mossberg, the pioneering technology reporter for the Wall Street Journal, Recode and the Verge, says he's quitting the site. ""I am doing this — after being on Facebook for nearly 12 years — because my own values and the policies and actions of Facebook have diverged to the point where I'm no longer comfortable here."" MSNBC anchor Kasie Hunt said yesterday that she too is bailing on Facebook. I'm not suggesting this is a giant wave. But Facebook needs to decide whether trampling on its users' expectations will ultimately cost the company more friends than it can afford."	nonTerrorism	Tech
Consumer groups allege Google misleads children in FTC complaint	"A group of consumer advocacy, privacy and public health groups urged U.S. regulators to probe whether children are being endangered by deceptive apps in Google's Play app store for smartphones using the Android operating system. The complaint filed Wednesday alleges Google's Play store is harming kids by allowing apps that break privacy laws, contain adult content or include manipulative advertising. The call for Federal Trade Commission (FTC) action is being led by two groups, the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood and the Center for Digital Democracy, both of which have previously attacked Google’s approach to kids. Twenty other groups also joined in the latest complaint. Google issued a statement emphasizing its commitment to protecting children while they are online — one of the reasons the company says it prohibits targeted advertising at children under 13. “We take these issues very seriously and continue to work hard to remove any content that is inappropriately aimed at children from our platform,” Google said. More than 2 billion devices worldwide are powered by Google software, with a significant number of those being used by minors. The complaint focuses on alleged misconduct under U.S. laws and regulations. The attempt to pressure the FTC to open an investigation comes amid an intensifying backlash against Google, Facebook and other companies that make most of their money by using their free services to track people’s interests and whereabouts and then mining that information to sell ads targeted at them. Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island who has been critical of Google, issued a statement supporting the groups seeking an FTC investigation, as did Sen. Tom Udall, a Democrat from New Mexico. “It is past time for the Federal Trade Commission to crack down to protect children’s privacy,” Udall said in a statement, according to the Associated Press. Although the FTC doesn’t typically comment on whether it will investigate issues raised in complaints, it has punished Google for what it deemed to be child exploitation in the past. In 2014, it reached a settlement requiring Google to refund $19 million for allowing apps distributed through its store to charge children for purchases made without parents’ consent. The Associated Press contributed to this report."	nonTerrorism	Tech
"Hackers spent years infiltrating EU diplomatic cables, US security firm says"	"LONDON – The European Union said it is probing a “potential leak of sensitive information” following a New York Times report that EU diplomatic cables were hacked. The EU Council Secretariat insisted it takes the security of its IT systems “extremely seriously.” European Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters he would not comment on leaks. ""All communication systems have vulnerabilities, so we're constantly dealing with this challenge,"" he said. The Times was allowed access to some 1,100 EU diplomatic cables by the “Area 1” security firm, a California firm that discovered the hacking. The “phishing” apparently occurred over a three-year period, beginning in 2015. The firm believes that a Chinese unit was responsible. It told the Financial Times that the hackers took advantage of a weak link in the Cyprus Foreign Ministry. The cables revealed inside information about what EU officials are thinking about President Trump, Russia’s moves in Ukraine, China, the Iran nuclear deal, as well as day-to-day diplomacy. The cables are not highly classified and the information breaks little new ground. But experts say the security concerns are real. One document appeared to capture a senior European official in Washington recommending that envoys from the EU's member nations work around Trump by dealing directly with Congress. In another apparent message, European diplomats described a recent summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland, as ""successful (at least for Putin).""

Google Maps user spots 'UFO' floating above Florida swamp – just outside the Bermuda Triangle	"An eagle-eyed Google Maps user has reported a mysterious ""UFO sighting"" in the skies above a Florida swamp. The strange object is partly blurred, and was spied in an area just outside of the notorious Bermuda Triangle. Even when zoomed in, it's hard to define exactly what the object is. CLICK ON THE SUN FOR MORE It's clearly multicolored and slightly ovular, but a stitching issue with Google Maps means you can't see the entire shape. It's also impossible to judge the distance of the strange object, although it appears to be floating some way above a treeline. The object was spotted in the Big Cypress National Preserve, which is located in southern Florida. This area is just outside the Bermuda Triangle, an area of the North Atlantic Ocean shrouded in mystery. The Bermuda Triangle has long been associated with mysterious aircraft and ship disappearances, paranormal activity, and even aliens. Most claims about the Bermuda Triangle have been deemed spurious, but many still believe that the area is supernatural. That may be why one Reddit user described the Google Maps find as a ""UFO sighting"". However, another user is probably closer to the mark, suggesting it's simply a ""butterfly"" caught on camera. A fast-moving butterfly caught in a single shot on Google Street View could easily be the explanation for this mystery. This theory is strengthened by the fact that moving one step away on Street View completely removes the object – which is exactly what would happen if the object was a butterfly flying past. Of course, a UFO might also avoid sticking around for too long, so we may never know. This isn't the first time something strange has been spotted on Google Maps. We rounded up 10 of the most mysterious Google Maps secrets here. And read about the curious case of Russia's censored Jeannette Island on Google Maps, too.

"Female journalists and politicians were abused every 30 seconds on Twitter in 2017, new report charges"	"Women on Twitter are sent abusive or problematic content every 30 seconds, according to a new investigation from Amnesty International. The human rights group partnered with a global artificial intelligence software firm called Element AI to survey millions of tweets received by 778 female journalists and politicians from the U.S. and the U.K. in 2017. With the aid of machine learning, the study found that abuse is very widespread and targets black women the most. A total of 7.1 percent of tweets sent to women in the study were considered ""problematic"" or ""abusive."" Although the social platform has a definition of abusive content, the ""problematic"" label was defined by Amnesty International as content that is ""hurtful or hostile, especially if repeated to an individual on multiple or cumulative occasions."" ""We found that, although abuse is targeted at women across the political spectrum, women of color were much more likely to be impacted, and black women are disproportionately targeted,"" Milena Marin, senior advisor for tactical research at Amnesty International, explained in a blog post. The study included politicians from across the political spectrum and journalists from a range of publications, including The New York Times, The Guardian, The Sun, Pink News and Breitbart. It had more than 6,500 volunteers sorting through the tweets — which Amnesty calls the world's largest crowdsourced dataset about online abuse against women. Among the ""Troll Patrol"" volunteers' other findings: – Black women were 84 percent more likely to be sent abusive tweets than white women. – Women of color, which includes Asian, Latinx, Black and mixed race women, were 34 percent more likely to be mentioned in abusive or problematic tweets than white women. – Online abuse is bipartisan: Liberal and conservative women, along with women from liberal and conservative publications, all faced similar levels of abuse. “Troll Patrol isn’t about policing Twitter or forcing it to remove content. We are asking it to be more transparent, and we hope that the findings from Troll Patrol will compel it to make that change. Crucially, Twitter must start being transparent about how exactly they are using machine learning to detect abuse and publish technical information about the algorithms they rely on,"" Marin said in a statement. Marin added: ""We have the data to back up what women have long been telling us — that Twitter is a place where racism, misogyny and homophobia are allowed to flourish basically unchecked."" ""I would note that the concept of “problematic” content for the purposes of classifying content is one that warrants further discussion. It is unclear how you have defined or categorized such content, or if you are suggesting it should be removed from Twitter. We work hard to build globally enforceable rules and have begun consulting the public as part of the process — a new approach within the industry."" A source familiar with the company's thinking on the matter told Fox News that Twitter has introduced dozens of changes over the last two years to improve the safety of the platform. According to its latest biannual transparency report, Twitter received reports on over 2.8 million ""unique accounts"" for abuse, nearly 2.7 million accounts for ""hateful"" speech, and 1.35 million accounts for violent threats. Of those, the company took action — which can include account suspension — on about 250,000 for abuse, 285,000 for hateful conduct and just over 42,000 for violent threats. In addition, Twitter has said in the past that it is investing in better technology to identify abusive content or behavior ahead of time and limit its spread."	nonTerrorism	Tech
Mysterious Twitter bug linked to 'unusual activity' from China and Saudi Arabia	"A mysterious Twitter bug has been linked to suspicious activity from China and Saudi Arabia. “We have become aware of an issue related to one of our support forms, which is used by account holders to contact Twitter about issues with their account,” explained Twitter, in a statement released Monday. The bug could be used to discover the country code of people’s phone numbers if they had one associated with their Twitter account, as well as whether or not their account had been locked by Twitter. SHOCKING SCALE OF RUSSIA’S SINISTER SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN AGAINST US REVEALED Twitter began working to deal with the bug on Nov. 15 and fixed it the following day. However, the company’s investigation into the mysterious issue has led to China and Saudi Arabia. “We observed a large number of inquiries coming from individual IP addresses located in China and Saudi Arabia,” it said. “While we cannot confirm intent or attribution for certain, it is possible that some of these IP addresses may have ties to state-sponsored actors.” The issue did not expose full phone numbers or users’ other personal data, according to the San Francisco-based firm. TWITTER'S RELEASE OF 10 MILLION RUSSIAN, IRANIAN INFLUENCE CAMPAIGN TWEETS SHOWS US VULNERABILITY The hack has prompted speculation that the bug may have been used to target dissidents. In a press conference Tuesday, Hua Chunying, a spokesperson for China's foreign ministry, cited a report that the IP addresses are unlikely to be hackers working for governments. ""As you know, the position of the Chinese government on cyber security is consistent,"" she said. ""We hope that when it comes to this issue, all parties can follow the spirit of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit to address this global issue through dialogue and cooperation. Fox News has reached out to Saudi authorities with a request for comment on the mysterious bug. Twitter revealed the bug on the same day that two separate reports revealed the bewildering scale of Russia’s social media campaign to sow discord in the U.S. In October Twitter also released an archive of more than 10 million tweets originating in Russia and Iran, which it says demonstrates efforts to spark friction in America."	nonTerrorism	Tech
 Facebook's photo bug: How to see if you were exposed	"Facebook has, yet again, goofed. On Dec. 14, the company announced that it inadvertently exposed 6.8 million users' photos to third-party apps that weren't supposed to have them. If you granted a third-party app access to your Facebook photos from Sept. 13-25, 2018, the bug allowed it access to all of your photos, not just those posted on your timeline. This means photos you posted privately, or those you didn't finish uploading, might be there. Facebook promised that it would send a notification to users who were exposed. However, if you don't want to wait around, you can check for yourself. If you want to be super thorough, you can check any third-party apps that you may have granted photo permissions to during this time. Or, you can follow these steps as a shortcut. 1. Log into your Facebook account. Open Facebook and type your username and password into the text boxes in the top right corner. Or select, your profile picture on the left. 2. Go to this page in Facebook's Help Center. 3. Scroll to the middle of the page. If your account was impacted, you'll see a list of apps that may have had inadvertent access to your photos. If your account was not impacted, you'll see a message that says ""Your Facebook account has not been affected by this issue and the apps you use did not have access to your other photos."" If Facebook says your photos were impacted, make sure to check the apps it lists and delete any photos that shouldn't be there."	nonTerrorism	Tech
ACLU slams 'nightmarish' Amazon patent application to bring facial recognition to your front door	"A patent application from Amazon to pair its facial recognition technology with a doorbell camera company that Amazon acquired has privacy advocates saying the company is building a perfect tool for authoritarian surveillance. The patent application, which was filed by doorbell company Ring prior to being purchased by Amazon earlier this year, shows a system that law enforcement officers can use to match faces of people walking by your house who might be deemed ""suspicious."" Homeowners could add photographs into the system, potentially allowing the doorbell's facial recognition program to scan anyone who walks by. If a match occurs, that information could be sent to the police, who could arrive in minutes. A former patent litigator who works for the ACLU in Northern California described it as ""disturbing"" on the civil liberties group's website. AMAZON EXECS GRILLED, JEERED AT NEW YORK CITY COUNCIL HEARING OVER HQ2 ""It’s rare for patent applications to lay out, in such nightmarish detail, the world a company wants to bring about,"" said Jacob Snow, a technology and civil liberties attorney at the ACLU. ""Amazon is dreaming of a dangerous future, with its technology at the center of a massive decentralized surveillance network, running real-time facial recognition on members of the public using cameras installed in people’s doorbells."" Amazon declined to comment for this story. The ACLU has previously called attention to Amazon's Rekognition program, which the tech giant has sold to police departments and marketed to ICE, as being discriminatory toward people of color, immigrants and the formerly incarcerated. A test found that the Rekognition system wrongly identified 28 lawmakers — most of whom were people of color — as police suspects. Amazon's facial recognition system has also been protested by its own employees and by lawmakers who worry it may be racially biased. The ACLU lawyer concludes by saying: ""Amazon is building the tools for authoritarian surveillance that advocates, activists, community leaders, politicians, and experts have repeatedly warned against. It is doing so without regard for how the technology will be exploited by law enforcement, ICE, and other government agencies prone to violence and racial discrimination."" A spokesperson from Ring gave Fox News the following statement: ""We are always innovating on behalf of neighbors to make our neighborhoods better places to live, and this patent is one of many ideas to enhance the services we offer. However, patents do not necessarily reflect current developments to products and services, and this patent certainly does not imply implementation. Privacy is of the utmost importance to us, and we always design our services to include strong privacy protections."" A person familiar with the patent told Fox News that the filing is only an application and has not been issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office; they also noted that, like most patents, it does not necessarily reflect any definitive plans for future products. A source familiar with Ring's thinking also said that privacy is a concern in terms of any future patents that may become new products."	nonTerrorism	Tech
Tumblr: Sorry about the rocky porn ban rollout	"Tumblr probably won't win back any users affected by the platform's new porn ban, which went into effect Monday. But that isn't stopping the company from trying. On Monday, Tumblr issued an apology for the porn ban's rocky rollout. It also claimed that no content is being purged from the platform; affected posts are simply being hidden from public view. That means content creators still have time to download and migrate their past posts to an alternative platform—assuming they don't deliberately run afoul of Tumblr's new anti-porn rules. ""We're removing content, not people. However, those who repeatedly and deliberately post new content that violates our updated guidelines may have their account deactivated per our Terms of Service,"" the company said in a support page post. Users most infuriated by the porn ban include erotic artists, free speech advocates, and members of the LGBTQ community, who say Tumblr is effectively banning certain sexual content from the mainstream internet. Tumblr disagrees; it noted that you can still write about sex on the platform. Users are also free to post nude images and videos related to gender-confirmation surgery, art, or political speech. ""We fully recognize Tumblr's special obligation to these communities and are committed to ensuring that our new policy on adult content does not silence the vital conversations that take place here every day,"" the company added in its blog post. But whether Tumblr and its computer algorithms can distinguish between legitimate content and pornographic imagery remains in question. To enforce the ban, the company said its anti-porn systems have been scanning through ""tens of billions of GIFs, video and photos"" and trying to flag that that actually depict sexual activities. Unfortunately, the system is far from flawless. Users have been noticing Tumblr mistakenly flagging images of dogs, Jesus, and superheroes as sexually explicit. ""Having a post mistakenly flagged as adult totally sucks; we understand and agree that there have been too many wrongfully flagged posts since we announced the policy change,"" Tumblr said on Monday. The company promises that its anti-porn detection systems will improve over time. But in a bit of irony, Tumblr is also asking the public to report when the system flags the wrong content. ""With tens of billions of GIFs, videos, and photos to review and millions of new posts every day, we really need your help to get it right,"" the company said. However, users most affected by the ban may not care; some have been instead calling for a boycott of Tumblr. Tumblr announced the porn ban weeks after the company's iOS app was temporarily pulled from Apple's App Store over child pornography found on the platform. In April, the US also passed a new anti-online sex trafficking law, called FOSTA, which opens the door for criminal prosecution and civil lawsuits against websites that faciliate prostitution. Tumblr has provided a link to users who want to appeal wrongfully flagged posts. If you want to export your blog from Tumblr, you can go here to learn how."	nonTerrorism	Tech
Google's China search engine project 'effectively ended': report	"Google has been forced to shut down and ""effectively end"" its controversial China search engine project, code-named Project Dragonfly, after members of the company's privacy team raised complaints, according to a new report. The tech giant led by CEO Sundar Pichai was forced to close a data analysis system it was using for the controversial project, according to The Intercept, citing two sources familiar with the matter. The news outlet originally broke the news that Google had been considering launching the app-based search engine. GOOGLE HAS NO PLANS TO LAUNCH SEARCH IN CHINA, PICHAI SAYS When asked for comment, a Google spokesman pointed Fox News to Pichai's comments to Rep. Tom Marino from last week, where Pichai said: “Right now there are no plans for us to launch a search product in China. We are, in general, always looking to see how best it's part of our core mission and our principles to try hard to provide users with information. We have evidence, based on every country we've operated in, us reaching out and giving users more information has a very positive impact and we feel that calling. But right now there are no plans to launch in China. To the extent we approach a position like that, I will be fully transparent, including with policy makers here, and engage and consult widely.” Employees of the Mountain View, Calif.-based Google were using Beijing-based website 265.com, which the company bought in 2008 from Chinese billionaire Cai Wensheng, as a sort of market research to see what search queries were being entered. Eventually, the search queries were transferred to Baidu, the leading search engine in China. Google famously pulled out of China in 2010 after it said it would not provide censored search services in the country. According to the report, engineers who worked on Project Dragonfly were using the data to review a list of websites that Chinese people would see if they entered the same word or phrase into Google. Following that, they checked to see if websites in the search results were blocked due to China's Great Firewall and put together a list of sites that are banned, including Wikipedia, British broadcaster BBC and others. After getting word of this, the company's privacy staff became ""really p-ssed"" according to one source in The Intercept's story and the engineers working on Project Dragonfly were told they could no longer use the data. “The 265 data was integral to Dragonfly,” said one source. “Access to the data has been suspended now, which has stopped progress.” REPORT REVEALS GOOGLE IS TRACKING YOU IF YOU LIKE IT OR NOT Following the decree from the privacy team, Google employees working on the app-based search engine have used different datasets, including ones from ""global Chinese"" queries entered into Google that live outside the world's most populous country, including those inside the U.S. and Malaysia. That has made it significantly harder to gather the accuracy of the results, and some team members have left the project, the report added. A source familiar with the matter told Fox News that has the company has worked on the project and privacy engineers have been brought in, any final launch would be ""contingent on a full, final privacy review but,"" but the company has not yet gotten to that point. The source added that Google's goak to serve its Chinese users has not ""dminished"" and the company's mission is to ""create access for all the world’s information to as many users as possible."" The Dragonfly efforts led to the resignation of several Google employees and prompted more than 700 to sign a letter to Pichai calling for it to be halted last month. Speaking in front of the House Judiciary Committee amid allegations of anti-conservative bias and privacy violations last week, Pichai said the company's efforts were only an exploration of what a search engine could look like in a country like China. ""Right now, we have no plans to launch [a search product] in China,"" Pichai said in response to a question from a lawmaker, adding that ""getting access to information is an important human right."" This story has been updated with a response from a Google spokesperson."	nonTerrorism	Tech
10 top gadgets of 2018	"Technology advances quickly, and it can be hard to keep up on which gadgets and gizmos made the biggest splash. Fortunately, looking back on 2018, a few big themes developed -- televisions became smarter, speakers responded to voice commands. Another interesting trend? Prices became a bit more reasonable for gadgets like the Apple iPhone XR. Here are the top picks in several categories. Apple made waves this year by releasing three different phones (including the iPhone XS and CS Max with an OLED display), but the iPhone XR with an LCD display is arguably the best option. At $749, it still has an extremely fast A12 Bionic processor and a high-end camera. Televisions are smarter than ever. The Samsung Q9FN can read your Wi-Fi settings and password from your Android phone, and it senses when you have an Xbox One connected and can adjust the display for 4K resolution and the best gaming color mode. The big news with the Apple iPad Pro 12.9-inch released this fall is that it uses a processor that is more powerful than some laptops, including Apple’s own MacBook line. Apps like Adobe Lightroom CC for iPad and Affinity Photo handle high-res images with ease. At just 2.67 pounds, the Dell XPS 13 is lighter than many tablets (including the Microsoft Surface line) but runs on a screaming fast Intel Core i7 processor. The claim to fame? Dell has figured out how to make the display run all the way to the edges. For productivity gurus, a curved wide screen like the HP Elite means you have more room for tabs in a browser, and more screen real estate for your apps. It’s also a brilliant gaming desktop and ideal for Skype sessions with a pop-up high-res webcam. For those who have not quite accepted the reality of using wireless earbuds yet and prefer a wired connection, it’s time to reconsider. The Jabra Evolve 65t sound as good if not better, and have the added benefit of one-touch access to a voice assistant. Drones with fold-up arms became the norm in 2018, and the DJI Mavic Pro is the best of the bunch. It’s also much quieter and smoother during flight. The Mavic captures in 4K video resolution and doesn’t require a complicated setup. The smartest robots let you leave them alone all day for weeks at a time, and they merrily go about their business. Set on a cleaning schedule, the Neato robotic vacuum will do its work without getting stuck or falling down a staircase. Speakers finally embraced the concept of voice control in 2018. The Sonos Beam lets you ask Amazon Alexa questions about the weather, but also syncs to the DISH Hopper 3 receiver for changing channels, finding shows, and raising the TV volume. A great camera, the Nikon Z7 snaps photos lightning fast, even at an athletics event. It uses a new mirrorless technology to capture stunningly crisp photos at 45.7-megapixels, letting in more light than a traditional DSLR."	nonTerrorism	Tech
"Bitcoin is 'dead,' says crypto millionaire"	"When it comes to bitcoin investor burnout, it takes one to know one. Erik Finman, who gained renown after becoming one of the earliest crypto millionaires, told MarketWatch in an interview that the virtual currency that made him wealthy is headed to the trash bin. “Bitcoin is dead, it’s too fragmented, there’s tons of infighting. I just don’t think it will last. “It may have a bull market or two left in it,” he added, “but long-term, it’s dead.” Finman was especially downbeat about Litecoin — which has fallen 95 percent from its peak — as being on the way out. “Litecoin has been dead for a while,” he said. “It’s like when the sun is going down and there’s that eight-minute period just before it goes dark. Litecoin is in its seventh minute.” In the last 24 hours, bitcoin hit a new yearly low of $3,126, and some analysts believe it may fall even further — below the $3,000 level. It’s been nearly a year since bitcoin surpassed $18,000 and appeared headed toward $20,000 — before falling back to earth. The volatile asset is now off more than 84 percent from the highs seen during its “tulip mania” phase of a year ago. At that point, in late 2017, accelerating numbers of people were spending real dollars on computers and electricity to uncover the “coins,” using advanced algorithms. This story originally appeared in the New York Post."	nonTerrorism	Tech
Facebook locks National Weather Service out of dozens of accounts	" Dozens of National Weather Service Facebook accounts were recently locked as the social media giant continued its crackdown of fake profiles. Approximately 70 NWS Facebook accounts were locked, and 13 remain affected, NWS spokeswoman Susan Buchanan confirmed to Fox News. Of those 13, some had been previously restored but eventually locked again. “We continue to work with Facebook to resolve the problem,” Buchanan said. The National Weather Service (NWS) of Columbia said its account had been disabled since late November. It was eventually restored on the morning of Dec. 14 because of Facebook’s “newly implemented security requirements.” On Nov. 13, the NWS of Seattle warned several other accounts “have been experiencing periods of being locked out.” Facebook can disable an account for a variety of reasons, including the use of a fake name, harassing another user or otherwise violating its terms of service. The social media site allows users to complete a form if an account is locked. FACEBOOK 'SORRY' FOR BUG THAT MAY HAVE EXPOSED THE PHOTOS OF 6.8M USERS A Facebook representative did not immediately return a request for comment from Fox News. The NWS of Columbia’s had its Facebook account locked during the massive snowstorm that slammed the South, leaving thousands without power, earlier this month. While the snow mostly hit North Carolina and Upstate South Carolina, the NWS of Columbia still warned followers of potential flooding on its Twitter account. In announcing its return to Facebook, NWS of Columbia reminded its followers that “Facebook is not always the most timely source of weather information” and encouraged people to check advisories on its website."	nonTerrorism	Tech

Google announces $1B New York campus	"Last week, Apple announced plans to invest $1 billion building a new Austin campus that will be home to 5,000 employees initially. This week, Google announced a $1 billion investment to build a new New York City campus called Google Hudson Square. The new campus has been made possible by signing lease agreements for 315 and 345 Hudson Street as well as a signed letter of intent for 550 Washington Street. In total, this will offer Google an additional 1.7 million square feet of space to house employees. Google will move into the two Hudson buildings beginning in 2020, and if 550 Washington Street is completed then Googlers will move in starting in 2022. Google already has a big presence in New York with over 7,000 employees located there working on its Search, Ads, Maps, YouTube, Cloud, Technical Infrastructure, Sales, Partnerships, and Research teams. But it's the search giant's intention to double the size of its NYC workforce within 10 years, and for that the company requires even more space. The last major investment in the city happened back in February when Google acquired the entire Chelsea Market building for $2.4 billion. Before that, Google acquired 111 Eighth Avenue for $1.9 billion and gained control of 2.9 million square feet of usable space. Google is keen to point out that it isn't just jobs it brings to New York, but lots of investment, too. The company says it has invested over $150 million in grants and employee-matched contributions to nonprofit institutions since 2011. The company also helped bring over 5,000 free Wi-Fi hotspots to the New York Public Library System. This investment is set to continue, especially in the areas of ""STEM education, workforce development, and access to technology."""	nonTerrorism	Tech
"HQ Trivia, Vine co-founder Colin Kroll dead at 34"	"Colin Kroll, the co-founder of the popular ""HQ Trivia"" game and the ""Vine"" video app, was found dead in his New York City apartment on Sunday. Kroll's girlfriend asked the New York Police Department to check up on the 34-year-old after she failed to get in touch with the tech executive, according to TMZ. Officers found him unconscious and unresponsive on his bed. His body reportedly was found with ""drug paraphernalia"" in his downtown Manhattan apartment. The medical examiner's office was working to determine the cause of death. In recent years, Kroll was named the CEO of HQ. The game live-streams short trivia contests and quickly became popular after it was released in 2017. Company staffers confirmed Kroll's passing on Twitter Sunday, writing that their ""thoughts go out to his family, friends and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time."" Kroll also co-founded Vine, a now-defunct app that allowed users to create, post and share six-second videos. His LinkedIn profile also stated he worked at Twitter and Yahoo.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai says AI fears are 'very legitimate'	"Google CEO Sundar Pichai said last week that concerns about harmful applications of artificial intelligence are ""very legitimate."" In a Washington Post interview, Pichai said that AI tools will need ethical guardrails and will require companies to think deeply about how technology can be abused. “I think tech has to realize it just can’t build it and then fix it,” Pichai, fresh from his testimony before House lawmakers, said.  “I think that doesn’t work.” Tech giants have to ensure artificial intelligence with “agency of its own” doesn't harm humankind, Pichai noted. HERE'S HOW TO BLOCK ROBOCALLS ON IPHONE AND ANDROID The tech executive, who runs a company that uses AI in many of its products, including its powerful search engine, said he is optimistic about the technology's long-term benefits, but his assessment of AI's potential downsides parallels that of critics who have warned about the potential for misuse and abuse. Advocates and technologists have been warning about the power of AI to embolden authoritarian regimes, empower mass surveillance and spread misinformation, among other possibilities. SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk once said that AI could prove to be “far more dangerous than nukes.” Google's work on Project Maven, a military AI program, sparked a protest from its employees and led the tech giant to announce that it won't continue the work when the contract expires in 2019. Pichai said in the interview that governments worldwide are still trying to grasp AI’s effects and the potential need for regulation. “Sometimes I worry people underestimate the scale of change that’s possible in the mid- to long-term, and I think the questions are actually pretty complex,” he told the Post. Other tech companies, such as Microsoft, have embraced regulation of AI — both by the companies that create the technology and the governments that oversee its use. But AI, if handled properly, could have “tremendous benefits,” Pichai explained, including helping doctors detect eye disease and other ailments through automated scans of health data. “Regulating a technology in its early days is hard, but I do think companies should self-regulate,” he told the newspaper. “This is why we've tried hard to articulate a set of AI principles. We may not have gotten everything right, but we thought it was important to start a conversation.” Pichai, who joined Google in 2004 and became chief executive 11 years later, in January called AI “one of the most important things that humanity is working on” and said it could prove to be “more profound” for human society than “electricity or fire.” However, the race to build machines that can operate on their own has rekindled fears that Silicon Valley’s culture of disruption could result in technology that harms people and eliminates jobs."	nonTerrorism	Tech
 Here's how to block robocalls on iPhone and Android	"Unwanted calls are often harmless but some are after your credit card information, IDs or passwords. All are a distraction and a waste of your time. Robocallers have gotten more devious by masking their calls with phone numbers that use the first three or first six digits of your phone number. But the scams are old. They pretend to be major banks, big tech companies, or government organizations like the IRS. NEARLY HALF OF ALL CELL PHONE CALLS WILL BE SCAMS BY 2019, REPORT SAYS Whatever the scam, here are several ways to stop unwanted calls on your smartphone – and one way to stop them cold. Manually: if you don’t get a lot of unwanted calls, you can block calls one at a time. On the iPhone you do this by selecting “Phone” then tapping the information icon (the encircled lowercase “i”), and selecting “Block this Caller.” On Android, it’s similar, you tap on the caller’s name, then long-press the number and tap “Block/report spam” (note that this procedure can vary slightly from device to device on Android). Blocking calls manually, however, is usually futile because scammers and spammers are constantly changing their numbers, usually on a daily basis. Use an app: there are lots of apps that take on telemarketers and suspicious calls, some are better at blocking calls before they get through than others. AT&T and Verizon, as with other carriers, offer apps that let you block calls by identifying likely fraudsters. To identify a suspicious call, numbers are run against a massive list of robocallers that is updated daily. For instance, the basic setup of the Verizon Caller Name ID app ($2.99 per month per line) is like any call blocker app on the iPhone. After installing the app, under the iPhone’s Settings you tap on “Phone,” then “Call Blocking & Identification,” then toggle on the Verizon “Caller Name ID” app. If you want to take this a step further, the Verizon app will also try to block suspicious calls and send them to voicemail. This requires going into the Verizon app and tapping “Block” then “Spam filter on” then setting a risk level. For Android devices, you open the Verizon Caller Name ID app, tap “Block management,” tap “Spam filter”, then toggle the feature on and select the risk level. HOW TO STOP APPLE AND GOOGLE FROM TRACKING YOU AT&T has its Mobile Security & Call Protect Plus ($3.99 per month) service that has Automatic Fraud Blocking, which can detect and allow you to block incoming suspicious calls. Samsung offers a “Smart Call” feature on its phones that can tell you if the call is suspicious and allows you to block the call. Go to “Caller ID and spam protection” in Call Settings, then turn on “Caller ID and spam protection.” Note that is not made available by all carriers. And Google offers caller ID & spam protection for Android. With this, you can stop spam calls from ringing on your phone. ""You won't get missed call or voicemail notifications, but you'll still see filtered calls in your call history and be able to check any voicemail you receive,"" according to Google. There are third-party apps that you can try for free such as Nomorobo and RoboKiller. After the trial period, both ask for a small monthly fee, which typically starts at $0.99 or $1.99 per month. There’s also an app called Hiya that is free. The best advice is to try these services and see which one works for you. Kill all suspicious calls: the most effective method is to limit calls to your contact list. On the iPhone, this will stop all unwanted calls from ringing on your phone. The only calls that get through are people on your contact list. Other legitimate calls typically go to voicemail. On the iPhone, you go to Settings, then tap on “Do Not Disturb” then select “Allow Calls From” then “All Contacts.” This is deadly effective and may be a good option for people hounded by spam calls. For Android, you can do this with apps such as Calls Blacklist."	nonTerrorism	Tech
 Holiday shoppers need to be on high alert for email scams	"Holiday shoppers need to be on high alert for spam-scams, a new report says. Malicious email disguised as delivery notifications or online purchase invoices are particularly effective during the holiday season when shoppers are active, says F-Secure, a Helsinki-based cybersecurity firm. ""The kind of spam that criminals use doesn't seem so spammy to a lot of people this time of year,” said F-Secures Behavioral Science analyst Adam Sheehan in a statement. HOW TO STOP APPLE AND GOOGLE FROM TRACKING YOU “The failed delivery notification scam works because it plays on our trust of huge brands that we deal with on a nearly constant basis,” F-Secure said. In a way, online criminals are also amateur behavioral scientists. “They know we’re inclined to click first before we ask questions,” the cybersecurity firm said. Tests conducted by F-Secure that simulated Black Friday and Cyber Monday phishing emails saw 39 percent more people click on these than at other times of the year. Phishing is when an attacker pretends to be a reputable organization, company or person. F-Secure's research cites spam campaigns -- sent out to a massive number of email addresses -- as the most common method for cybercriminals to distribute malware in 2018, accounting for 9 out of every 10 infection attempts throughout the year. A whopping 69 percent of spam campaigns tried to trick users into visiting malicious websites and download a malware-laden file or other malware that results in an infection, F-Secure said. Malicious attachments were used in the remaining 31 percent, F-Secure added. Shopper-targeted spam “heats up right before the holidays as cybercriminals count on consumers being in a hurry,” said Ryan Wilk, VP of Customer Success for Mastercard-owned NuData Security in a statement provided to Fox News. Their goal is to steal consumer credit card or account information. “They [criminals] use this information to take over accounts or use the credit cards to steal goods and services online,” Wilk said. CREDIT CARD SKIMMING ON THE RISE AS INDIANA MAN GETS ARRESTED But retailers are fighting back. Merchants are now becoming more aggressive at trying to separate real customers from fraudsters, Wilk added. Using behavioral analysis and a technique known as passive biometrics – which analyzes customers patterns and habits – retailers can up their game, according to Wilk. “Merchants…are able to determine if the legitimate user is accessing and transacting on the account or if it is a cybercriminal at work,” Wilk said. So, what should consumers do? ""Keep your system updated and run security software at all times. And train yourself to not click on links in emails—especially emails related to shipping,"" F-Secure said."	nonTerrorism	Tech
Fox On Tech: Young singles navigate online dating in the Trump era	"There's no denying it: we live in a politically-charged atmosphere, and it's creeping out of the beltway and into other areas of everyday life - including dating! Whether you lean left or right is a “bigly” factor in deciding whether to “swipe left” or “swipe right” when looking for love. And as people from both sides on the aisle double down on their beliefs, the lack of compromise is taking a toll on relationships - especially following the election of Donald Trump. And there's data to back it up. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, 29% of Americans say the Trump presidency has negatively impacted at least one of their relationships. A 2017 Wakefield Research study, entitled the ""Trump Effect on American Relationships,"" finds nearly 30% of Americans who are married or in relationships say the current, hyper charged political atmosphere has caused tension with their partner. And a survey of one million members of the dating site OK Cupid found 65% of users wouldn’t even entertain the thought of dating a Trump supporter. The so-called “Trump Effect” is also boosting business for divorce attorneys like Lois Brenner. “I’ve been doing this for about 35 years, and I have never seen anything like it,” Brenner told the New York Daily News. “It’s kind of amazing.  It’s really surprising and astounding.” But there's at least one group not surprised by this trend: relationship experts. “When I started almost 30 years ago I would inquire about politics like I would about any other factors that would go into making a match. What I’ve observed is what with the polarization that’s taking place politically, it’s now not a factor to be considered, but it’s almost a deal breaker for many people,” Leora Hoffman, a professional matchmaker based in the Washington, DC area, told Fox News. She also says she's personally witnessed situations in which a couple has broken up over a lack of political compatibility, and it's getting more common. There are now a number of apps and websites catering to singles specifically looking for people with similar political beliefs, so you won’t have to “swipe left” if you see someone whose views conflict with yours. But there are still some people who are willing to branch out of their political comfort zone in their search for a mate. One woman who describes herself as politically independent wouldn’t mind going out with someone who has different beliefs “as long as you’re not too far to the left, too far to the right, you have a brain, you can actually think.” Another single looking for love who identifies himself as firmly on the left told us he’s open to dating someone from across the aisle because “it’s not a one size fits all kind of thing.” But he says political compatibility is of the “utmost importance because it’s going to come up eventually”. So how does a young dater navigate the hyper partisan atmosphere so romance can survive the political divide? Hoffman says she believes honesty is the best policy from the beginning, and recommends not shying away from the truth when it comes to your own political beliefs. “While somebody might say they’re in the middle of the road politically, they really have opinions, and it plays itself out on the first date,” she said. Hoffman also encourages singles in the dating pool to place a greater emphasis on things they have in common. “If they focus on what makes them feel connected with each other, rather than looking for the differences, in the beginning especially, they’re going to start on a healthier foundation,” she said And it's not all bad - despite today’s political climate, some couples with opposing views are capable of maintaining an ideologically healthy relationship. One woman told us, “I wish I would’ve known before I got married my husband's political views a little bit better."" But for this bipartisan union, the secret is simple: “We don’t talk about politics at home,” she said. Steve Rappoport is a Newscast Producer and Anchor for Fox News Radio.

MIT develops incredible system to 'shrink' objects	"Researchers at MIT have developed a system to “shrink” objects down to a nanoscale level. While this may conjure up images of “Ant-Man” or “Honey, I Shrunk The Kids,” it’s actually a 3-D printing technique that could prove useful in fields such as medicine, robotics and optics. ""It's a way of putting nearly any kind of material into a 3-D pattern with nanoscale precision,"" said Edward Boyden, an associate professor of biological engineering and of brain and cognitive sciences at MIT, in a statement. DRONE FLEET COULD HELP FIND LOST HIKERS, MIT RESEARCHERS SAY The researchers used a technique they describe as “implosion fabrication” to 3-D print objects at a nanoscale. Their work builds on an existing technique developed at Boyden’s lab for high-resolution imaging of brain tissue. “This technique, known as expansion microscopy, involves embedding tissue into a hydrogel and then expanding it, allowing for high-resolution imaging with a regular microscope,” explained MIT in the statement. “By reversing this process, the researchers found that they could create large-scale objects embedded in expanded hydrogels and then shrink them to the nanoscale.” Similar to their research on expansion microscopy, the researchers used a highly absorbent material made of polyacrylate, which is commonly found in diapers, as the “scaffold” for their nanofabrication process. This was bathed in a solution that contained molecules of fluorescein, a compound widely used as a coloring agent. When activated by a laser light, the molecules attached to the “scaffold.” Using two-photon-microscopy, the fluorescein molecules were attached to specific locations within the gel. ""You attach the anchors where you want with light, and later you can attach whatever you want to the anchors,"" said Boyden. ""It could be a quantum dot, it could be a piece of DNA, it could be a gold nanoparticle."" A paper on the research was published in the journal Science. ""It's a bit like film photography -- a latent image is formed by exposing a sensitive material in a gel to light,"" said Daniel Oran, an MIT graduate student, and one of the paper's lead authors, in a statement. ""Then, you can develop that latent image into a real image by attaching another material, silver, afterwards. In this way implosion fabrication can create all sorts of structures, including gradients, unconnected structures, and multimaterial patterns,"" MIT RESEARCHERS GIVE THE WHITE CANE USED BY THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED A HIGH-TECH UPDATE Scientists say they can then shrink objects 10-fold in each dimension, making an overall 1,000-fold reduction in volume. “Once the desired molecules are attached in the right locations, the researchers shrink the entire structure by adding an acid,” explained MIT in its statement. Using the technique, researchers say that they can create objects that are around 1 cubic millimeter, patterned with a resolution of 50 nanometers. “There is a tradeoff between size and resolution: If the researchers want to make larger objects, about 1 cubic centimeter, they can achieve a resolution of about 500 nanometers,” they explained. However, improvements to the process could eventually boost resolution. The system could be particularly useful for creating specialized lenses for the likes of cell phones, microscopes and endoscopes, according to the scientists involved in the project. ""There are all kinds of things you can do with this,"" explained Boyden, noting that the technology needed is already in many research labs. ""With a laser you can already find in many biology labs, you can scan a pattern, then deposit metals, semiconductors, or DNA, and then shrink it down,"" he added. The system is just the latest innovation to come out of MIT. In a separate MIT project, researchers have been developing sophisticated technology that uses drones to find lost hikers by searching under dense forest canopies. In August, scientists at MIT announced the discovery of a galaxy cluster that they say is “hiding in plain sight.”"	nonTerrorism	Tech

Apple plans to resolve China iPhone ban with a software update	"Apple and Qualcomm are not the best of friends at the moment, and the relationship breakdown is playing out in the courts. Earlier this week, Qualcomm saw some success in the Chinese courts and got most iPhones banned from sale and import into China due to patent infringement. However, Apple believes it can overcome the ban with a software update. As Reuters reports, Apple intends to release a software update in China early next week that will address ""the minor functionality of the two patents at issue in the case."" In so doing, Apple could render the ban void before it even starts to have an impact on iPhone shipments and sales. The ban as it currently stands means the iPhone X , iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 6s Plus, and iPhone 6s can't be sold in China. The two patents these smartphones infringe cover how users adjust and reformat photos and how apps are managed using a phone's touch screen. It's important to note that the infringement only applies to handsets running iOS 11 and not the more recent iOS 12. The software update next week will therefore be targeted specifically at iOS 11 users. At the same time, Apple filed a request for reconsideration with the court which invoked the preliminary injunction. For now, Qualcomm believes the ban is already in force, but all models of iPhone remain available to purchase in China. By next week, the ban could be irrelevant, but that doesn't mean it will be removed immediately. As part of the reconsideration request, Apple offered to pay a ""counter security"" of roughly $87 million to get the ban lifted."	nonTerrorism	Tech
"Amazon execs grilled, jeered at New York City Council hearing over HQ2"	" New York City Council members unloaded on Amazon and the Economic Development Corporation during a contentious hearing about the tech giant's plan to bring its second headquarters to the Long Island City waterfront. During the hearing, two Amazon executives were peppered with questions about the deal that will bring at least 25,000 jobs paying an average of $150,000 per year in exchange for tax breaks and perks worth up to $3 billion. The plan for a helipad, which has been criticized by Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, drew particular scorn. ""The only transportation piece of this project I've seen involves a helipad. I'm serious. This is like something out of The Onion,"" said New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson in his opening remarks. ""So yes, Jeff Bezos' commute is all set. What about the rest of the New Yorkers crammed into the subways every day? Johnson, who plans to have more public hearings in the coming months, also said: ""I'm already seeing stories of a real estate boom in Long Island City. Is that a good thing? Not to most New Yorkers who are already struggling to afford their rents here."" “We believe this project will be a positive economic impact for the city and the state,” said Brian Huseman, vice president of public policy for Amazon, according to The New York Times. His remarks were reportedly met by guffaws from the audience, which seemed to be comprised mostly of the project's opponents. Later in the hearing, which was interrupted by applause and jeers at times, Brian Huseman, Amazon's vice president of public policy, said that Amazon will fund the construction of the helipad and that it was not currently using helicopters to commute to work. Johnson reportedly responded: ""Do you realize how out of touch that seems for the average New Yorker?"" The City Council Speaker, who represents a huge swath of Manhattan neighborhoods in District 3, had a hard time getting the two Amazon executives to agree to more public hearings. ""You're a trillion dollar company that's coming to New York City, you're avoiding the land use process, you're taking $3 billion in money and you won't agree to come to public hearings?"" he asked. The Amazon executives said they'd be happy to continue a dialogue with the City Council, but Johnson insisted that any dialogue had to be in public. Councilmember Jimmy Van Bramer, who has also expressed opposition to the deal, asked the Amazon executives if the company would agree to redirect the $500 million state capital grant to four massive public housing projects in Queens. “So we’re going to create jobs here in the city,” Huseman said, according to Courthouse News. Later, he explained that about half the jobs would be technical and half nontechnical; Holly Sullivan, Amazon's head of worldwide economic development, said the company would hire 2,000 to 3,000 workers in New York on an annual basis. At another point in the hearing, James Patchett, president and CEO of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, which had a hand in negotiating the deal, defended the agreement and pointed to a Quinnipiac University poll of New York voters showing 57 percent approve of the planned Long Island City HQ2. According to Courthouse News, opponents of the deal have said the poll is not representative of Queens residents, nearly half of whom are immigrants and many of whom are undocumented. The poll also indicated less support for $3 billion in subsidies, with nearly 80 percent of those surveyed saying New York City should be ""more involved"" with Amazon's plans. When the Amazon executives and city officials were sworn in, protesters in the chamber's balcony unfurled a blue banner that said “No to Amazon.” Opponents of the deal reportedly shouted, “G-T-F-O, Amazon has got to go!” A previous version of this story mischaracterized Brian Huseman's response to a question about whether Amazon executives would use the helipad to commute to work. Fox News regrets this error."	nonTerrorism	Tech
Taylor Swift used facial recognition to thwart stalkers	"As one of the biggest pop stars in the world, Taylor Swift has amassed many stalkers. Just this fall, she reportedly received a restraining order against a man who had been sending her letters for two years, claiming he was her soul mate, and threading to rape and kill her. To prevent the musician from coming face to face with her stalkers, Swift's team employed a somewhat controversial solution during her May 18 Rose Bowl show: facial-recognition technology. According to Rolling Stone, a facial-recognition camera was hidden inside a kiosk playing clips of Swift from rehearsals. As fans approached the kiosk to watch, the camera would stealthily snap their photo. Those images were then compared to a database of Swift's known stalkers. ""Despite the obvious privacy concerns—for starters, who owns those pictures of concertgoers and how long can they be kept on file?—the use of facial-recognition technology is on the rise at stadiums and arenas,"" the report notes. Ticketmaster, for instance, recently invested in Austin, Texas-based facial recognition startup Blink Identity, which says its technology can identify 60 people a minute walking at full speed past a sensor, meaning paper and digital tickets may soon be a thing of the past. The same tech can be used throughout a venue to allow concertgoers to purchase drinks, snacks, and merchandise. Meanwhile, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in August started using new facial-recognition technology at 14 early adopter airports. Just days after it was implemented, the system helped identify an imposter who attempted to enter the US with someone else's passport. In the future, the technology may be used throughout the airport security and boarding processes, so travelers are identified via biometrics instead of their boarding pass and ID, CBP said."	nonTerrorism	Tech
Amazon Fire TV gets 25 Sega Genesis classics	"If you're looking for some retro classics to play over the holiday period, then you could go out and buy a PlayStation Classic or either of Nintendo's NES or SNES mini consoles. However, if you already own a Fire TV , there's now 25 classic Sega Genesis games to play on it using the Fire TV remote. While playing games with a TV remote is far from ideal, there are Bluetooth gaming controllers available to use with the streaming device. Unfortunately, Amazon's own Fire TV Game Controller isn't one of them depending on which Fire TV device you're using. As The Verge reports, the bundle of 25 games costs $14.99 and is available from today. The included titles are: That's a pretty good selection to keep you and your family entertained right up until Christmas Day when the presents get opened. But buying the bundle may backfire if you intended to spend the holidays catching up Netflix's best original TV series, or those shows your friends already binge-watched. The games have been updated to include a number of visual tweaks including opting to play in standard 4:3 or using a ""pixel perfect"" mode to better suit your high-definition TV. Accessing the games is easily done through a single app which then allows you to filter by genre. There's also a rewind feature and the ability to save your progress in each of the games. If you do decide to purchase this Genesis collection, try playing it with the Fire TV remote first as it may be good enough. If it isn't, then consider purchasing a compatible gaming controller such as the Matricom G-Pad, Mad Catz CTRLR Micro, or the SteelSeries Stratus XL. If you'd prefer a wider selection of Genesis games to play, there's always the Classics collection for PS4 instead, which includes over 50 games for $30."	nonTerrorism	Tech
Tumblr's iOS app returns to App Store as porn ban looms	"Tumblr's iOS app has returned to Apple's App Store following the platform's pledge to ban pornographic content starting Dec. 17. The app was back on Apple's App Store on Wednesday evening. But when you open it up, the software now includes a notice about the upcoming adult content ban. It isn't clear what other changes were made, but Tumblr appears to have removed an option that let you toggle on or off whether ""Not Safe for Work"" content can appear in your search results. The option was probably scrubbed, given that Tumblr has already been cracking down on all NSFW material. For instance, searches for ""porn,"" ""hentai,"" and ""boob"" return nothing over the iOS app. So far, Tumblr and company parent Oath haven't commented on the app's return to the App Store. But it was originally taken down in mid-November over the presence of online child pornography. In trying to address the problem, Tumblr began purging pages belonging to erotic artists, sparking a flood of complaints. Then this month, the platform announced a ban on adult content, saying it was necessary to make the online service a ""safe place"" for all users. To filter out the porn, Tumblr will rely on automated tools. Erotic artists and sex workers argue that Tumblr is their go-to platform to promote their projects. Many have also noticed Tumblr's current porn-detecting algorithms are flagging innocent posts as explicit material. ""Indeed, the Internet is full of porn, the overwhelming majority of which caters to heterosexual men,"" said the Electronic Frontier Foundation. ""But on Tumblr, people created sex-positive spaces on Tumblr that don't exist elsewhere. People created portfolios of their work, all of it, on the platform. Those spaces are going to vanish."" As of today, you can still find porn and erotic art on the iOS app. But presumably, Tumblr will begin filtering out the content from public view on Dec. 17 when the adult content goes into effect. Whether users will care to continue using the iOS app is another matter; one study published in 2016 estimated that close to a quarter of people who visited Tumblr were there to consume porn. Many content creators affected by the ban are now looking to migrate to other platforms."	nonTerrorism	Tech
Google slammed by New Zealand lawmaker after naming suspect in the murder of British backpacker	"Google has been by slammed by a New Zealand lawmaker after the tech giant reportedly published the name of the suspect in the murder of British backpacker Grace Millane. The 22-year-old British tourist was murdered earlier this month, according to police. She was staying at a backpacker hostel in Auckland when she went missing Dec. 1. Millane failed to contact her family on her birthday the following day, which alarmed them. A week later, police found Millane's body in a forested area not far from the side of the road in the Waitakere Ranges near Auckland. BODY BELIEVED TO BE BRITISH BACKPACKER FOUND IN NEW ZEALAND, SUSPECT CHARGED IN MURDER, POLICE SAY A 26-year-old man has been charged with Millane’s murder but has not been named. The BBC reports that the suspect in the case was granted a “temporary name suppression” while he awaits trial. However, the suspect was named in a mass email sent out earlier this week by Google, according to the New Zealand Herald. The email, which was viewed by the Herald, reportedly named the accused in its subject heading. The email was sent out to people signed up to receive information on “what’s trending in New Zealand.” New Zealand Justice Minister Andrew Little told the newspaper that publication of the suspect’s details in New Zealand is a breach of the court order. If the breach was linked back to Google infrastructure in New Zealand, the tech giant could be prosecuted, he said. AMAZON EXECS GRILLED, JEERED AT NEW YORK CITY COUNCIL HEARING ON HQ2 Google told the Herald that its initial investigation shows that it did not know about the suppression order. The search giant would comply with any court order it was made aware of, it said. The spokesperson said that Google trends alerts are generated automatically by algorithms based on searches in specific geographies over a certain period of time. Police have declined to comment on reports that Millane met the man charged with her murder on Tinder. The Associated Press contributed to this article."	nonTerrorism	Tech
Fake Amazon packages and GPS helped cops catch package thieves	"As the online shopping market continues to explode – it reached $121.5 billion, up 14 percent year-over-year in the third quarter according to the U.S. Department of Commerce – the biggest concern has been package theft, alarming shoppers, law enforcement and e-commerce companies alike. Working in conjunction with Amazon, Jersey City police have taken the matter into their own hands to catch these so-called porch thieves, using technology. The Jersey City police department installed doorbell cameras and planted fake packages with GPS tracking devices inside and waited for thieves to try and steal them. Much to no one's surprise, they did not have to wait long, with someone trying to take a package three minutes after it had been placed. AMAZON EXECS GRILLED, JEERED AT NEW YORK CITY COUNCIL MEETING OVER HQ2 ""We had a box out on the street for three minutes before it was taken,"" police Capt. James Crecco, who is overseeing the mission, told the Associated Press ""We thought it was a mistake at first."" The suspect was caught, Crecco added. It is unclear if the suspect was subsequently charged with a crime. According to a 2017 study, 11 million homeowners in the U.S. had packages stolen in the previous year. Approximately 53 percent of homeowners are concerned that packages left outside their homes can be stolen, and 74 percent of packages are stolen while homeowners are at work, adding to the problem. Amazon — which is providing equipment free for the Jersey City program — declined to provide figures on how many packages are reported stolen or missing, as did UPS and FedEx. ""We absolutely report them to local law enforcement when we hear of them, and we encourage our customers to do the same,"" UPS spokesman Glenn Zaccara said. Jersey City Police Chief Michael Kelly told The Associated Press that locations for cameras and boxes were selected using the city's own crime statistics and mapping of theft locations provided by Amazon. ""Most of the package thefts we've made arrests on revolve around (closed-circuit TV) or private surveillance cameras that give us a still image,"" Kelly said. ""With the bait packages, some will be under video surveillance, and some will have GPS."" Several members of the Jersey City police department volunteered their dwellings to have the technology installed and the boxes placed. Jersey City Police Chief Michael Kelly told the AP that the program has been approved by a municipal prosecutor and hopes to expand the program, with Amazon's help. The Jeff Bezos-led company has not yet responded to a request for comment from Fox News, but told the AP: ""We appreciate the increased effort by local law enforcement to tackle package theft and remain committed to assisting however we can."" Similar programs have been tried in other cities including Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Hayward, California. Amazon has worked hard to stave off package theft in a number of different ways. Earlier this year, the tech giant acquired Ring, which makes video doorbells and a number of other home security products, for $1 billion. Upon completion the deal, the press release made sure to note that the ""two companies will work together to accelerate Ring’s mission to reduce crime in neighborhoods..."" Despite this, there has been an outcry against Amazon from several groups who say that the tech giant is infringing upon people's privacy with its technology. On Wednesday, the ACLU wrote a blog post about one of Amazon's patents that would add face surveillance to homeowner's front doors. ""As a former patent litigator, I've spent a lot of time reading patents,"" Jacob Snow, Technology & Civil Liberties Attorney, ACLU of Northern California wrote in the post. ""It’s rare for patent applications to lay out, in such nightmarish detail, the world a company wants to bring about. Amazon is dreaming of a dangerous future, with its technology at the center of a massive decentralized surveillance network, running real-time facial recognition on members of the public using cameras installed in people’s doorbells. The company has also received a significant amount of blowback for its Rekognition facial recognition technology, both from its employees and those who have bemoaned it could lead to mass surveillance in the not-too-distant future. In July, the Rekognition facial surveillance technology wrongly tagged 28 members of Congress as police suspects, according to ACLU research.

"Do you have Netflix face? How the blue light from your phone, laptop and iPad is ruining your skin"	"Look away now, because blue light from your mobile phone, laptop and other devices could be causing damage, premature aging and hyperpigmentation to your skin. According to experts, spending hours each day online could be having a drastic impact on the health of our skin - and it's all to do with blue light. How long do you spend each day looking at a screen? CLICK ON THE SUN FOR MORE From mobile phones to staring at our computer screens and tablets, we're clocking up hours upon hours of time exposing our skin to blue light (otherwise known as high-energy visible light). According to Glamour, it's having a detrimental impact on our skin, with 79 percent of us checking our smartphones before bed. Added to that, 28 percent of us will reach for our phones in the five minutes before we turn out the lights and over half of us check our devices within 15 minutes of waking up. According to Dr. Sweta Rai, a spokeswoman for the British Association of Dermatologists, light from your screens can ""cause some pigmentation problems."" ""They can give you a falsely aged appearance, we see that often in darker skin people,"" she explained. ""If you look at a pristine face and put brown spots on it it will look aged from sun damage. ""There is some truth to the fact that blue light penetrates deeper into the skin compared to UV light. ""And that is being studied at the moment as to what effect it does have."" The effect of blue light on our skin has led to several beauty brands launching blue light-fighting products. Earlier this year, dermatologist and clinical assistant professor at New York University Shari Marchbein, told Allure: ""Visible light, especially in the blue wavelength, has become a hot topic in skin care, as there is mounting evidence that supports its contribution to photo-aging, including wrinkles, worsening skin laxity, and hyperpigmentation."" And it seems other practicing dermatologists have noticed a growing trend in accelerated hyperpigmentation. Dr. Engelman, consulting dermatologist for Elizabeth Arden told Glamour: ""Women in their early twenties come into my office with heightened pigmentation. ""When I look into the waiting room, they’re all sat staring at their screens. ""As this accelerated hyperpigmentation is developing out of proportion to their sun damage and darkening over the winter months, we know it can’t be due to UV. ""The pigment cells are feeding off this new indoor light pollution.” Other experts recommend going hands-free (to avoid direct contact with your skin while you're on the phone) or turning devices onto night mode. And if you struggle with acne or blemishes, switching to hands-free could minimize breakouts, too. Dr. Mahto, author of The Skincare Bible, told Refinery29: “Spots on one cheek could be related to mobile phone use, where a dirty screen surface, combined with heat and occlusion, may stimulate the oil glands.” If this wasn't scary enough, some experts have claimed over-exposing ourselves to screens can result in an altered face shape. ""Continuous looking down and squinting has changed the way people’s faces sit,” said celebrity facialist Nichola Joss. Time to log off? We think so.

 FCC effort to stop robotexts prompts censorship concerns	" The FCC says it's giving more authority to wireless carriers to stop spam over text messages. But critics claim the commission may empower carriers to block legitimate content. On Wednesday, the FCC voted 3-1 against an attempt to reclassify SMS and MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) messages as ""telecommunication services,"" which would've have subjected the messaging services to more regulations. The FCC instead decided to classify SMS and MMS messaging as ""information services,"" so that wireless carriers can keep combatting spam and scam robotext messages without going through regulatory hurdles. ""The FCC shouldn't make it easier for spammers and scammers to bombard consumers with unwanted texts,"" FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement in supporting the move. But not everyone believes today's vote was about stopping spam. According to FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, it was actually about censorship. ""Let's be honest, today's FCC decision offers consumers no new ability to stop robotexts,"" she said in a tweet. ""It simply provides that carriers can block our text messages and censor the very content of the messages themselves."" The request to reclassify SMS and MMS messages as telecommunication services came from a 2015 petition by Twilio, a cloud provider that helps companies send text messages. The petition was filed on complaints that wireless carriers were blocking text messages Twilio's clients had been exchanging with their customers. In 2007, free speech advocate Public Knowledge also petitioned the FCC over the risk of wireless carriers blocking legitimate text messages, but from activist groups. This occurred when Verizon was found blocking an attempt by an abortion rights group to send text message alerts to its supporters. Reclassifying SMS and MMS messages as telecommunication services would have made it illegal for wireless carriers to filter out legitimate text messages. But Wednesday's vote now opens the door for potential SMS text censorship, critics say. ""No one should mistake today's action as an effort to help consumers limit spam and robotexts,"" said Public Knowledge SVP Harold Feld in a statement. ""This decision does nothing to curb spam, and is not needed to curb spam. It is simply the latest example of Chairman Pai's radical agenda that puts companies ahead of consumers."" Commissioner Rosenworcel said that prior FCC rulings have made it clear wireless carriers have the power to stop robotexts, without need for new regulatory authority. ""But instead of using this common-sense approach, this agency does the opposite. We twist the law to reach the conclusion that you no longer have the final say on where your text messages go and what they say,"" she said in a statement. However, the FCC says today's vote will have no impact on the legitimate text messages consumers send and receive. Carriers have ""every incentive"" to deliver the SMS text consumers want in order to retain customer loyalty, the commission said in its ruling. ""Consumers have a wealth of options for wireless messaging service,"" it added. ""If wireless providers do no ensure that messages consumer wants are delivered, they risk losing those customers to other wireless providers or to over-the top applications."""	nonTerrorism	Tech
How to stop Apple and Google from tracking you	"Apple and Google can track your every move. But there are ways to mitigate this or shut it down. The tracking and snooping that Apple and Google do isn’t necessarily a nefarious plot to spy on you. It can make apps more useful. For example, data used by Google Maps can be helpful in getting directions. That said, it’s not always clear how app providers harvest and use this data. There's no telling, for example, how a shopping or dating app may use your data. The New York Times reported this week that a variety of companies use location data when users enable location services. Set against this backdrop, users need to think about privacy. “Companies use IP addresses, advertising IDs, and cookies to track users and store details about their online behaviors, browsing history, searches, purchases, viewing habits, and more,” Paul Bischoff, privacy advocate at Comparitech.com, told Fox News. “The resulting ‘profiles’ sold to third parties might not have names attached, but they can be so specific as to only belong to a single person or small group of people,” he added. Generally, disable your phone's location services when not in use, Bischoff said. In iOS go to “Settings” then select “Privacy” and turn off the “Location Services.” You can also turn off tracking for individual apps on the list that appears below Location Services. Apple, however, warns on its support page that these actions will ""limit the performance of various Apple and third-party apps."" Even if you don't turn off Location features, Apple will give you reminders about apps using location data in the background. For example, a screen may pop up and say, “’Weather’ has been using your location in the background. Do you want to continue allowing this?” 'FORTNITE’S' POPULARITY HAS ALSO MADE IT A POPULAR TARGET FOR CRIMINALS And if you want to do something less drastic such as curb ad tracking, on the Privacy page under “Advertising” you can turn on “Limit Ad Tracking.” With Google, it can be a little more involved because Google is not only in charge of Android but its reach extends to the popular Chrome browser and to Google Search. On Android, go to the Settings icon on your phone and then tap “Security & location.” Then under “Privacy” tap ""Location"" then tap “Use Location” and turn that off.  Or below Use Location on “App-level permissions” you can turn off the location permissions for individual apps. But you may want to go a step further. Go to your Google My Account page and turn off “Location History.” Then, if you have more serious privacy concerns, you can opt to turn off “Web & App Activity.” “Remember that Google is a bit sneaky in this regard, as some apps collect location data even if your location history is disabled. You'll have to turn off all tracking of web and app activity, which may impact how other Google apps function,” Compareitech’s Bischoff said. And some more tips about app tracking from Marco DeMello, CEO of app security specialist PSafe. “When the product is free you are the product,” DeMello said, citing a widely-used axiom of the Internet. “Consider going for a premium or, at a minimum, an ads-free version of an app/game you're using or interested in. When you pay for services there's no incentive to sell your data,” DeMello said. “Keep your phone like you keep your house – clean. Don’t keep around apps and/or games you no longer need or use. [It will] reduce the chance of these apps and/or games capturing and profiting from your data,” DeMello added. Apple did not respond to a request for comment for comment on this story. Google provided pages (linked to above) that explain how to manage your location data on Android devices and in apps."	nonTerrorism	Tech
"Islamic State not defeated, just transforming: experts"	"Even as the last pockets of resistance in eastern Syria hold their ground, the Islamic State group is shapeshifting into a new, but no less dangerous, underground form, experts warn. Also known as ISIS, or the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the group had long been ready to cede the territory it once held in its self-styled “caliphate,” and has already begun the switch to a more clandestine role, closer to its roots. “ISIS anticipated its battlefield defeat and the loss of the caliphate and prepared accordingly,” said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University in Washington. “Hundreds of ISIS fighters were able to flee Syria, bribe their way through Syria to Turkey and thereby disappear,” he said. “Beneath the surface, ISIS has always played the long game.” In a recent study entitled “ISIS’s Second Resurgence,” Brandon Wallace and Jennifer Cafarella of the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said the jihadist group “has already restructured its operations to return to a regional insurgency.” “ISIS is finding new sources of revenue and rebuilding command-and-control over its scattered remnant forces in order to prepare for a future large-scale insurgency in both Iraq and Syria,” the report said. The group has managed to smuggle funds to several countries around the Middle East, using front companies such as car dealerships, electronics stores, pharmacies and currency exchanges that it established in Iraq, experts said. “We’re entering a very risky period,” said Seth Jones of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). “I have no faith that ISIS has been crushed, defeated.” “They already have gone underground,” he said. “They are doing what everybody does who faces a better-equipped opposition, with air and naval capabilities: they have to face Russian air strikes, cruise missiles.” “What do you do in a case like that?” he said. “You disperse, you don’t operate in platoon-size positions the way they did in 2014, you go underground, you build your clandestine network, you conduct targeted assassinations, IEDs [roadside bombs] and you wait for opportunities.” Data collected by the CSIS show that in some provinces in Iraq, such as Kirkuk in the northeast, the number of attacks attributed to IS doubled last year from 2017, with an average of 75 a month. The group has regularly picked off tribal leaders, government officials, police and members of the armed forces. In a television interview last month, the Iraqi Kurdish leader Massud Barzani said that IS “is not defeated and will not be ended easily.” “IS was on the ground, now they are underground,” Barzani said, noting that they had returned to many areas they had been driven out of even stronger than before. An Islamic State fighter in Syria, who spoke to The New York Times via WhatsApp, echoed Barzani’s grim message. “Do you think the Americans can defeat the caliphate?” said the fighter, who identified himself only as Yehya. “It’s a war of attrition. When the coalition stops the air strikes, we will return immediately.” “We didn’t leave for good. We’re still in Syria, even in the areas that you think we left. We still have our suicide bombers ready to attack. Our informers are active,” he said. Hoffman agreed that the US and Russia are locked in a war of attrition against the Islamists, “and frankly we’re losing it. There are nearly a quarter of a million salafi-jihadi fighters all around the world.” That is four times the number of jihadists there were in 2001, when Al-Qaeda triggered the global “war on terror” with its jetliner suicide attacks on the United States. Hoffman said that while military operations may have held them at bay, Islamic State operatives “carry within their own DNA the seeds to constantly regenerate, to continue to attract, recruit.” “Who would have thought in the immediate aftermath of September 11 that 17 years later, we would still be fighting?” he said."

"Two dead, 11 wounded in car bomb in northern Iraqi city Tal Afar"	"BAGHDAD (Reuters) – At least two people were killed and 11 wounded on Tuesday by a car bomb in the northern Iraqi city of Tal Afar, a former Islamic State stronghold, the military said. Tal Afar, about 80 km (50 miles) west of Mosul, experienced cycles of sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shi’ites after the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, and produced some of Islamic State’s most senior commanders. The city, which had about 200,000 residents, came under the militants’ control when Islamic State overran swathes of Iraq’s north in 2014. It fell to Iraqi Security Forces, backed by the US-led coalition, in August 2017, the last area to be retaken in the north before fighting moved to the Syrian border. A heavy security presence has remained since then and the city has been mostly quiet."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Bomb kills three Vietnamese tourists, Egyptian guide near pyramids: officials"	"CAIRO (Reuters) – Three Vietnamese tourists and an Egyptian guide were killed and at least 10 others injured when a roadside bomb blast hit their tour bus on Friday less than 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) from Egypt’s world-famous Giza pyramids, authorities said. The bombing is the first deadly attack against foreign tourists in Egypt for over a year and comes as the tourism sector, a vital source of foreign currency revenue, recovers from a sharp drop in visitor numbers since the country’s 2011 uprising. No immediate claim of responsibility was reported. Islamist extremists, including militants linked to Islamic State, are active in Egypt and have targeted foreign visitors in the past. At least nine Vietnamese tourists were injured, as well as the Egyptian driver, according to official statements. The tourists were heading to a sound and light show at the pyramids, which they had visited earlier in the day, said Lan Le, 41, who was also aboard the bus but unhurt. “We were going to the sound and light show and then suddenly we heard a bomb. It was terrible, people screaming,” she told Reuters, speaking at Al Haram hospital, where the injured were taken. “I don’t remember anything after.” Egypt’s interior ministry said the bus was hit by an explosion from an improvised device hidden near a wall at around 1815 local time (1615 GMT). About two hours later the vehicle could be seen behind a police cordon with one of its sides badly damaged and the windows blown out, a Reuters reporter said. Dozens of police, military and firefighters were at the site, on a narrow sidestreet close to the ring road, where traffic was moving normally. Shortly afterward, workers brought a pick-up truck to tow the bus away. An investigator at the scene said the device had likely been planted near the wall. The interior ministry confirmed the death of two of the tourists, and the state prosecutor’s office later said a third had died. In total, 14 Vietnamese tourists had been traveling on the bus, it said. Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly told local TV from Al Haram hospital that the guide had died from his injuries. “The bus deviated from the route secured by the security forces,” Madbouly told Extra News channel, an assertion also made by the owner of the company that organized the bus tour. “We have been in contact with the embassy of Vietnam to contain the impact of the incident, and what is important now is to take care of the injured,” the prime minister said. The bus driver later told local media he had not deviated from the route. Egypt’s army and police launched a major campaign against militant groups in February, targeting the Sinai Peninsula as well as southern areas and the border with Libya. UAE reopens Damascus embassy in boost for Assad The government says fighting Islamist militants is a priority as it works to restore stability after the years of turmoil that followed the “Arab Spring” protests of 2011. Those events and the bombing of a Russian airliner shortly after it took off from Sharm el Sheikh in 2015 caused tourist numbers to plunge. The last deadly attack on foreign tourists in Egypt was in July 2017, when two Germans were stabbed to death in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Police probe hoax bitcoin bomb threats across US	"(Reuters) – U.S. law enforcement officials on Friday were investigating a wave of hoax emailed bomb threats demanding bitcoin payment that caused worry but no damage in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. On Thursday in North America, hundreds of businesses, government offices and schools received awkwardly-worded letters threatening to set off explosives if payments of $20,000 in cryptocurrency were not received. The threats led to scattered evacuations of schools and transit stations before the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies dismissed them as lacking credibility. Hoax threats were received in cities including Washington, New York, Detroit, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Oklahoma City, Grand Rapids, Iowa, Denver, Ottawa and Calgary, Alberta. Investigators do not yet know who was responsible, two federal officials said on Friday. There is no evidence to suggest that any of the recipients made ransom payments, one of the officials said. Cisco Systems Inc’s (CSCO.O) Talos cyber security unit said it believes the threats came from a group of fraudsters previously responsible for sending “sextortion” emails that claim to have videos showing the recipients having sex. The fraudsters threaten to release compromising videos they claim to have obtained with software that recorded people through webcams on their computers. Some of this week’s bomb threats came from the same internet addresses used in those sextortion campaigns, Talos researcher Jaeson Schultz said in a blog post. “The criminals conducting these extortion email attacks have demonstrated that they are willing to concoct any threat and story imaginable that they believe would fool the recipient,” the blog said. “We expect these sorts of attacks to continue as long as there are victims who will believe these threats to be credible, and be scared enough to send money to the attackers,” it said. A similar series of hoax bomb threats occurred in December 2015, prompting officials in Los Angeles to close the city’s public school system, which national law enforcement officials later criticized as an over-reaction. Two weeks previously, a married couple inspired by Islamic State had killed 14 people at a California county office building in a shooting rampage. A teenager with dual Israeli-U.S. citizenship was arrested in Israel in March 2017 for making bomb threats to more than 100 Jewish organizations and Jewish community centers in dozens of U.S. states over several months."

Authorities: Wave of hoax bomb threats made across US	"By the Associated Press A wave of bomb threats emailed Thursday to hundreds of schools, businesses and government buildings across the U.S. triggered searches, evacuations and fear — but there were no signs of explosives, and authorities said the scare appeared to be a crude extortion attempt. Law enforcement agencies across the country dismissed the threats, saying they were meant to cause disruption and compel recipients into sending money and were not considered credible. Some of the emails had the subject line: “Think Twice.” They were sent from a spoofed email address. The sender claimed to have had an associate plant a small bomb in the recipient’s building and that the only way to stop him from setting it off was by making an online payment of $20,000 in Bitcoin. “We are currently monitoring multiple bomb threats that have been sent electronically to various locations throughout the city,” the New York City Police Department’s counterterrorism unit tweeted. “These threats are also being reported to other locations nationwide & are NOT considered credible at this time.” Other law enforcement agencies also dismissed the threats, which were written in a choppy style reminiscent of the Nigerian prince email scam. The Palm Beach County, Florida, sheriff’s office and the Boise, Idaho, police said they had no reason to believe that threats made to locations in those areas were credible. One of the emails wound up in a spam filter, Boise Police Chief William Bones said. The FBI said it is assisting law enforcement agencies that are dealing with the threats. “As always, we encourage the public to remain vigilant and to promptly report suspicious activities which could represent a threat to public safety,” the FBI said in a statement. Thursday’s scare came less than two months after prominent Democratic officials and CNN’s Manhattan offices were targeted with package bombs. The suspect in that case, Cesar Sayoc, is in jail while awaiting trial. In 2015, an emailed bomb threat prompted different reactions from the nation’s two largest public school systems. The Los Angeles school system closed down under threat of a mass attack, but New York City officials quickly saw it as a hoax. In the wake of Thursday’s emails, some schools across the country closed early and others were evacuated or placed on lockdown. Authorities said a threat emailed to a school in Troy, Missouri, about 55 miles (88 kilometers) northeast of St. Louis, was sent from Russia. The bomb threats also prompted evacuations at city hall in Aurora, Illinois, the offices of the News & Observer in Raleigh, North Carolina, a suburban Atlanta courthouse and businesses in Detroit. “Organizations nationwide, both public and private, have reported receiving emailed bomb threats today,” Michigan State Police spokeswoman Shannon Banner said. “They are not targeted toward any one specific sector.” Penn State University notified students via a text alert about threats to a half-dozen buildings and an airport on its main campus in State College, Pennsylvania. In an update, the school said the threat appeared to be part of a “national hoax.” Officials at Columbine High School in Colorado were dealing Thursday with a bomb threat of a different sort. Students were being kept inside for the rest of the school day after someone called in a bomb threat against the school. The Jefferson County, Colorado, Sheriff’s Office said the caller claimed to have placed explosive devices in the school and to be hiding outside with a gun. Sheriff’s spokesman Mike Taplin said nothing was found at Columbine, where 12 students and a teacher were killed by two students in 1999. Two dozen other Colorado schools were also temporarily placed on lockout, meaning their doors were locked but classes continued normally, as the threat was investigated."	Terrorism	Terrorism
" Iran’s Rouhani says sanctions may lead to drugs, refugee, bomb ‘deluge’ "	"DUBAI (Reuters) – Iranian President Hassan Rouhani predicted a “deluge” of drugs, refugees and attacks on the West if U.S. sanctions weaken Iran’s ability to contain them. “I warn those who impose sanctions that if Iran’s ability to fight drugs and terrorism are affected … you will not be safe from a deluge of drugs, asylum seekers, bombs and terrorism,” Rouhani said in a speech carried live on state television. Separately, Foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was quoted as saying that the United States is selling more arms into the Middle East than the region needs, making it a “tinderbox”. U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a multilateral nuclear deal with Iran in May and reimposed sanctions on Iran’s vital oil industry last month. Drug trafficking is a serious challenge for Iran as it borders Afghanistan – the world’s largest opium producer – and Pakistan, a major transit country for drugs. “We spend $800 million a year to fight drugs which ensures the health of nations stretching from of Eastern Europe to the American West and North Africa to West Asia. Imagine what a disaster there would be if there is a breach in the dam,” Rouhani said. In 2012, Iran accounted for two thirds of the world’s opium seizures and one fourth of the world’s heroin and morphine seizures, a U.N. report published in 2014 showed. “We have been just as determined in the fight against terrorism … sacrificing hundreds of valuable troops and spending millions of dollars annually,” Rouhani said. “We don’t expect the West to pay their share, but they should know that sanctions hurt Iran’s capacity to fight drugs and terrorism,” Rouhani added. Iran, a key supporter of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria’s civil war, has sent military advisers as well as materiel and regional Shi’ite militias to fight militant groups. In Iraq, Iranian-backed militias and their Iranian advisers helped Iraq defeat Islamic State. “Economic terrorism means creating horror in a country and create fear in other countries that intend to invest (there). America’s withdrawal from the (nuclear accord) is undoubtedly a clear example of economic terrorism,” Rouhani told a meeting of heads of parliaments of China, Russia, and four other countries. More than 700,000 undocumented Afghans have returned from Iran this year as the Iranian economy tightens, according to data from the U.N.’s migration agency, and Iranian media said some Afghans were seeking to enter Turkey to reach Europe. Zarif warned about the dangers of large U.S. arms sales in the Middle East, where Iran’s regional rival Saudi Arabia is a major buyer of Western weapons. “The Americans have turned the region into a tinderbox. The level of arms sales by the Americans is unbelievable and much beyond regional needs and this points to the very dangerous policies followed by the Americans,” IRNA reported Zarif as saying."

Three dead in suicide attack on Libyan foreign ministry	"TRIPOLI (Reuters) – At least three people were killed when suicide bombers attacked Libya’s foreign ministry in Tripoli on Tuesday, the health ministry said. The assailants were suspected to be Islamic State militants, a security source said. The three attackers began their assault with a car bomb, damaging vehicles and buildings, and then opened fire on the ministry. Two managed to get inside and blow themselves up. The other was killed by ministry guards, the source said. Heavy smoke rose from the building which was surrounded by security forces as people were rushed to hospital. The health ministry said at least eleven people were wounded. The ministry denounced the attack on its employees, saying: “the Libyan people are waging a war on terrorism on behalf of the world.” Suicide bombers have targeted a number of Libya’s vital institutions as militant groups take advantage of the chaotic political situation. A source from Tripoli Revolutionaries Brigade, one of the strongest armed groups in the capital, told Reuters their spokesman, Abdulrahman Mazoughi, died in the attack."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Nine more arrested in Morocco over murder of Scandinavian tourists	"OSLO/RABAT (Reuters) – Moroccan police have arrested nine more people in an investigation into the murder of two Scandinavian female tourists by suspected Islamic State militants, authorities said on Friday. Four suspects were already under arrest over the killing of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, from Denmark, and Maren Ueland, 28, from Norway, whose bodies were found on Monday in the Atlas Mountains with knife wounds to the neck. The North African country’s Central Bureau for Judicial Investigations said nine further arrests were made in various Moroccan cities over suspected links to the killers. It said electronic devices, an unauthorized hunting rifles, knives and materials that could be used for bomb-making were found in the course of the raids. Moroccan authorities have said the four suspects first arrested over the murder had pledged allegiance to Islamic State in a video posted on social media before the killings. In Norway, police said a separate video, purportedly showing the killings of the two tourists, was probably authentic. Further technical analysis of the video was needed, Norway’s National Crime Investigation Service said earlier on Friday. “We still believe, however, that we have grounds to say that so far, there is nothing concrete to show that this video is not real,” it said in a statement. Danish counterparts said they were still analyzing the video, while Moroccan authorities said on Thursday they working on authenticating it. Jespersen and Ueland were killed on the way to Toubkal, North Africa’s highest peak and a popular hiking destination. A source from Imlil, the village near where the two friends were killed, said one of them was found dead inside their tent while the body of the other was found outside. Compared to other countries in North Africa, Morocco has seen relatively few Islamist attacks. The last major one was in April 2011, when 17 people were killed in the bombing of a restaurant in Marrakech. Later on Friday, Norwegians planned to march with torches through Bryne, the coastal hometown of Maren Ueland, to express solidarity with her family. On Saturday, a gathering will be held outside the Norwegian Embassy in the Moroccan capital Rabat in support of the families of the victims and to condemn terrorism. Thousands of people have said on Facebook that they would attend."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Canadian gets 40 years for IS-inspired plot against New York	"A Canadian man who plotted to bomb the New York subway and Times Square and “create the next 9/11” in support of the Islamic State group was sentenced Wednesday to 40 years in prison. Abdulrahman El Bahnasawy, 20, of Mississauga, Canada, pleaded guilty two years ago to seven counts of terrorism-related offenses following his arrest in May 2016. But the charges against him were kept under seal until October 2017 while US authorities sought other participants in the plot. According to the Justice Department, El Bahnasawy launched the plot together with a US citizen living in Pakistan, Talha Haroon, and Philippines native and resident Russell Salic. El Bahnasawy scouted out possible attack locations in New York, including bombing targets and concert venues where he would shoot people, with his target date in mid-2016. The Justice Department said he had acquired materials to make bombs and a place to stay just outside of the city from which to stage the attacks. “Demonstrating his commitment to carry out the attacks, El Bahnasawy pinpointed bomb locations on a map of the subway system, and acquired an array of bomb-making materials. El Bahnasawy aspired, in his words, to ‘create the next 9/11,'” said Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney from New York. Haroon had planned to fly to the United States to take part while Salic wired money from the Philippines to help them. The plot was disrupted by an FBI agent who posed as an Islamic State supporter ready to take part in the plot, the Justice Department said. El Bahnasawy was arrested after he traveled to the New York City area to prepare for the attacks. Haroon was arrested in Pakistan in September 2016 and Salic was arrested in the Philippines in April 2017. Both are still being held and face extradition requests from the United States."

Somali man arrested in Italy after comments about attacking Vatican: police	"By Reuters ROME (Reuters) – Italian police said on Monday they had arrested a 20-year-old Somali man suspected of having been a member of Islamic State and who had threatened to bomb churches in Italy, including St. Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican. They told reporters in the southern city of Bari that the man, identified as Omar Moshin Ibrahim, was detained last Thursday and that a magistrate had charged him on Monday with instigating terrorism and supporting terrorism. Police said Ibrahim was stopped following a month-long surveillance operation as he was about to leave Bari where he worked for a cleaning company. The investigation, the police officials said, included wiretaps in which Ibrahim was heard telling someone, “Let’s put bombs in all the churches of Italy. Where is the largest church? It is in Rome.” In another conversation, they said, he was heard praising those who “killed on the path of Allah” and hailing last week’s shooting at the Strasbourg Christmas market in which a gunman killed five people. Police added that the man used the alias of Anas Khalil and called himself “Yusuf” on social media, and had arrived in Italy in 2016. He was suspected of having been a militant of Islamic State previously. Italian police have increased security around churches, including St. Peter’s, ahead of Christmas, which draws big crowds to the Vatican area."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Engineer, 32, who posted Islamic State propaganda videos on Facebook is jailed for seven years"	"A civil engineer and father-of-one who shared videos encouraging people to 'support, justify and glorify the actions of Islamic State' has been jailed for seven years. Abdulrahman Alcharbati, 32, shared links to the horrific videos on his Facebook page in the early hours of February 8 last year, with a judge saying they had been 'intended to encourage acts of terrorism'. During his trial at Newcastle Crown Court, it was also revealed jurors were told how one of the films showed Syrian soldiers being violently beaten to death and dragged away. His Facebook page had been suspended eight times between December 2016 and March 2017 - but he managed to get it reinstated on each occasion by claiming that he was merely 'exposing what was happening' and that he needed to use the site for work. The court also heard how another of the videos depicted young children at an orphanage being given Islamic State 'indoctrination' and being taught how to be a 'thorn in the side of enemies of religion'. Alcharbati, who was born in Syria, also uploaded a link to a film of people celebrating in the aftermath of a suicide bombing. He was convicted of six counts of disseminating terrorist material, relating to the postings he made in February 2017, and was also found guilty of possessing a 'bomb-making' manual. Jurors were told how the manual, which was discovered on his phone following his arrest on May 3, 2017, provided guidance on how to make suicide vests. Sentencing him to seven years in jail on Friday, Judge Paul Sloan QC said: 'These were links to extremist Islamic videos, Isis inspired videos which glorified terrorism and were intended to encourage acts of terrorism. 'In my view, your repeated claims that your intention was simply to share and shed light on what was happening is not credible. 'Your offending is aggravated by the fact that you failed to heed what were, in effect, repeated warnings from Facebook.' The judge added that Alcharbati, of Westholme Gardens, Newcastle, was someone who 'clearly had terrorist motivations', saying that his other Facebook posts were characterised by an antipathy towards the Syrian government, made worse by the death of his brother in Syria in 2015. Dan Pawson-Pounds, prosecuting, said: 'They were a series of videos which, of themselves, had one purpose, to support, justify and glorify the actions of Islamic State groups.' The court heard how Alcharbati, who has been diagnosed as bipolar, claimed that he suffered from a 'manic episode' when he made the posts. Bunty Batra, defending, told how the defendant has been on 'hunger strike' since Tuesday, as 'he believes he should be in a hospital, rather than a prison'. Detective Chief Superintendent Martin Snowden, of Counter Terrorism Policing North East, said that Alcharbati's postings 'encouraged others to carry out terrorist activity'. He added: ' He was also found to have downloaded an instructional guide which contained detailed instructions on how to make a suicide vest. 'While there was no evidence to indicate the purpose for the possession of this material, or any intended distribution of it, the very fact that it was downloaded is deeply concerning.'"

Man dies ‘after being found naked in the street’ and another injured in ‘connected’ attacks	"A man has died and another has been seriously injured after suspected connected attacks in Stockton. Two men have been arrested and remain in police custody over violence in the Parkfield area of the town on Sunday morning. A resident told TeessideLive he saw a man lying naked in the street with cuts to his face and body as people shouted 'we're going to kill you'. Police arrived and put a man into a van as officers tried to speak to the injured party, but he appeared to have died, the resident said. This was the second of two incidents this morning - Cleveland Police said the first incident occurred at around 4.30am, when officers were called to a report of an alleged serious assault on Yarm Road. A man was taken to hospital where he is being treated for a fractured skull and other injuries to his body and he is in stable condition. Officers were then called to nearby Westbourne Street at 7.15am, where a man had suffered serious injuries to his body. He was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead. The identity and ages of the victims have not yet been released, and police have also not said for what offences the two men have been arrested under suspicion of. Officers have not said how the victims were injured but the ambulance service said two men were taken to hospital with stab wounds. Westbourne Street remained cordoned off close to the junction with Shaftebury Street on Sunday morning. Crime scene officers could be seen in white suits carrying out investigations, placing items in clear evidence bags. Armed police are also understood to have attended. Blood could be seen on the road while an item of dark clothing was left by the kerb. The street comprises mainly rented accommodation and there are several hostels in the area. Worshipers returning from Sunday morning prayers at the Farooq E Azad Mosque and Islamic Centre at the end of the street witnessed the horrific sight. One resident told TeessideLive he saw a man lying naked face down in then street with serious injuries. He said: 'The guy was laid naked on the street and the coppers had just pulled up. 'People on the street were shouting at a man ""we're going to kill you"".' He said the injured man had cuts to his face and body and police tried to speak to him but he believed he had died. A man was put into a police van, he said. Both the injured man and the man spoken to by police 'looked English' and were 'young lads', he said. Police are increasing patrols in the area. Detective Superintendent Warren Shepheard said: 'We understand the levels of concern caused by incidents of this nature and increased patrols will remain in the area while enquiries continue. 'Please approach our officers with any concerns you may have and they will happily assist.' A spokesman for the North East Ambulance Service said they were called at 7.30am to reports of an assault. Two paramedic ambulances, a rapid response vehicle and the HEMS medic from the Great North Air Ambulance attended. The spokesman said: 'We treated and took to hospital two patients suffering stab wounds, head injuries, abdominal injuries and blood loss.' He said they were initially called to help one man in his 30s. 'But when were called there it was very clear there was a second patient needing assistance as well,' he said."	Terrorism	Terrorism

I Shot The Sheriff is played during French TV news report on terrorist killing	"Stunned viewers heard the Bob Marley hit 'I Shot The Sheriff' being played in the background during a French TV news report about Cherif Chekatt being killed by armed police. The 1973 song was being played by someone in the crowds and was picked up by BFM TV's microphones during a bulletin, aired hours after the Christmas market terrorist had been shot dead in Strasbourg. It is believed an onlooker chose the song because its lyrics include the word 'sheriff' which sounds the same as the attacker's first name. Chekatt killed three and injured 13 during a gun rampage on Tuesday before being 'neutralised' by cops last night. Viewers could scarcely believe their ears. One wrote on Twitter: 'Am I the only one to have heard I Shot the Sheriff behind the footage of the killed terrorist on BFM TV?' Another added: 'Surreal! I shot the sheriff is playing in the background.' BFM has yet to comment. Jubilant crowds shouted 'bravo' and applauded French police last night after the gunman was killed in the street. Three policemen found Chekatt walking in the Neudorf area of central Strasbourg at 9pm. They tried to stop him but he opened fire and they shot him dead outside a warehouse. Crowds at the scene paid a touching tribute to officers who had hunted the terrorist for two days. More than 720 anti-terror cops had been looking for the 29-year-old since he walked through a Christmas market shooting and stabbing pedestrians before escaping wounded in a hijacked taxi. Chekatt then hid out in a warehouse a few hundred yards from his parents' house where he grew up in the northeastern French city. A woman spotted a man fitting his description with an injured arm on Thursday afternoon and alerted authorities. Police sealed off the area and used a helicopter with thermal cameras to hunt for the terrorist - but couldn't find him until the evening. Checkatt, 29, had criminal convictions in France and Germany and was radicalised in jail. After his death, ISIS propaganda news agency Amaq claimed he was a 'soldier' of Daesh. Police found weapons and jihadist propaganda in his flat and on Wednesday arrested his parents, two brothers and a friend in connection with the attack. On Friday, they arrested his third brother in Algeria to see if he was involved. Police thanked people who spotted him for helping track him down tweeting: 'Thank you for your reports that helped to find the wanted individual.' Police officer Emmanuel Georg told BFM TV station that three police officers patrolling the neighbourhood tried to intercept a suspect corresponding to Chekatt's description as he was about to enter a building. The officer said: 'He opened fired, they responded and managed to shoot him down.' A witness said he heard shots and rushed to the window to see what was happening and closed the shutters when he spotted the cornered suspect across the street. Cem Akcakaya said: 'I was very afraid for my children, I told them to go away, and I went to the side.' The propaganda wing of the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack, calling Chekatt one of its 'soldiers' who responded to its calls to target citizens of nations in the coalition fighting the jihadists in Iraq and Syria. Among the 13 injured in the attack, three remain in critical condition while three others have been released from hospital, Castaner said Thursday. Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries told reporters after news that Chekatt had been killed: 'I think it will help to get back to a life that I would describe as normal. With the death of this terrorist... citizens, like me, are relieved.' Neighbours on the housing estate where Chekatt family's lived described the suspect as a typical young man who dressed in jogging pants and trainers rather than traditional Islamic robes. A leader of a community group said outside Chekkat's apartment building in Strasbourg: 'He was a little gangster, but I didn't see any signs of him being radicalised.' The Paris prosecutor's office said Chekatt's parents and two brothers were being held in custody, while two of his sisters in Paris were also questioned today and one of their homes was being searched. French President Emmanuel Macron expressed 'the solidarity of the whole country' towards the victims as he arrived for a European summit in Brussels last night. 'It is not only France that has been hit... but a great European city as well,' he added, referring to the seat of the European parliament in the eastern French city that lies on the border with Germany. A relieved Strasbourg prepared to reopen its popular Christmas market on Friday after French police shot dead the gunman who killed three people there in an attack claimed by the Islamic State group. Cherif Chekatt was killed late Thursday after a two-day manhunt when a police patrol spotted him on a street in the district where he was last seen after Tuesday night's attack on Christmas shoppers. The lights on the market's towering Christmas tree were illuminated Friday for the first time since the attack ahead of the official re-opening of the market at 11am. 'I hope life will get back to normal but I'm not too sure,' said Franck Hoffmann as opened his wooden chalet offering Christmas candles and ornaments on Friday. 'Business isn't going to be what it was,' he predicted. Questions remained over how Chekatt was able to evade the tight security perimeter set up for an event long known to be a prime target for jihadist groups. Around 500 police, security agents and soldiers control access at checkpoints on the bridges leading to the river island, a UN World Heritage site, that houses the market. The goal is to 'create a bubble with searches at the entry points,' Mayor Roland Ries said after the attack, while regional government representative Jean-Luc Marx said he had not determined 'any flaws in the security measures'. Many residents, however, were not convinced after Chekatt managed to slip through the controls with a handgun and a knife. 'It doesn't surprise me,' said Emeline, 38, who works in the city centre. 'You wear a heavy coat, put something in the bottom of your bag. You can bring in what you want.' France's anti-terror prosecutor Remy Heitz is to hold a press conference in Strasbourg on Friday while Interior Minister Christophe Castaner will attend the reopening of the market, which usually draws two million people every year. France has been on high alert since the start of a wave of jihadist attacks in 2015, which prompted a threefold surge in the security budget for the market, to one million euros. Chekatt, a 29-year-old career criminal who lived in a rundown apartment block a short drive from the city centre, was flagged by French security forces in 2015 as a possible Islamic extremist. Strasbourg's deputy mayor Alain Fontanel admitted that despite patrols, plainclothes police, profilers and video surveillance, 'the risks can be reduced, but not eliminated'. 'We can't pat down and search everyone, only carry out random checks,' he said, adding that huge lines at checkpoints would only create a new potential target for terrorists. 'Someone who wants to get in an area this big with a weapon can do it,' he said. Such reasoning was little comfort to the residents and tourists who flock to the Strasbourg market. 'We thought this would happen only in Nice or at the Bataclan, but here it is at home,' said Sylvain, who works at another market in the city centre. He was referring to the truck attack which killed scores at Bastille Day festivities in Nice, southern France, in 2016, and the massacre at the capital's Bataclan concert hall in November 2015. 'I'm not going to forget this anytime soon. It's too painful. I'm not even sure I'm able to cry,' he said. Residents of Strasbourg's Neudorf neighborhood expressed relief, such as Pierre Plasse, who said: 'Everybody's quite happy that the killer has been finally shot. I think now, the city and life can keep going on in Strasbourg.'"	Terrorism	Terrorism
Suspects in Morocco murder of Scandavian tourists made video pledging allegiance to Islamic State	"Four suspects arrested over the killings of two Scandinavian university students in Morocco's Atlas Mountains made a video pledging allegiance to the Islamic State group, authorities in the country said on Thursday. Morocco's general prosecutor confirmed the authenticity of a video circulating on social media in which the four threatened to carry out attacks for Isil and its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Investigations showed that the video was made last week before the killing of the two women, Danish and Norwegian tourists who were trekking in the Atlas Mountains. The Danish intelligence agency had earlier said the women's slayings ""may be related"" to the Islamic State group. Three of the suspects were arrested on Thursday as they tried to flee Marrakech on a bus, Moroccan national security spokesman Boubker Sabik said. Another suspect was arrested on Tuesday.  Authorities have said no one is being sought besides the four in custody. Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen confirmed the identities of the victims, 24-year-old Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, of Denmark, and Norwegian citizen Maren Ueland, 28. The University of South-Eastern Norway said both women were students at its campus in Boe, southern Norway. ""What should have been a holiday trip turned into a nightmare"" for the women, Mr Loekke Rasmussen told reporters in Denmark."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Islamic State links hinted as Morocco nabs three more suspects in Nordic hikers' slaying	" Authorities arrested three more suspects Thursday in the deaths of two Scandinavian university students who were killed in Morocco’s Atlas Mountains, while the Danish intelligence agency said the women’s slayings “may be related” to the Islamic State group. The three suspects were arrested as they tried to flee Marrakech on a bus, Moroccan national security spokesman Boubker Sabik said. Authorities have said they consider the killings a terrorist act, and Sabik said officials are investigating if the three have extremist ties. Another suspect was arrested Tuesday. Moroccan prosecutors said he had affiliations to an extremist group, without naming it. No other suspects besides the four now held are being sought, Sabik said. Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen confirmed the identities of the victims, 24-year-old Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, of Denmark, and Norwegian citizen Maren Ueland, 28. The University of South-Eastern Norway said both women were students at its campus in Boe, southern Norway. “What should have been a holiday trip turned into a nightmare” for the women, Loekke Rasmussen told reporters in Denmark. The women’s bodies were found Monday in a remote region of the Atlas Mountains not far from a village that often is the starting point for treks to Mount Toubkal, North Africa’s highest peak. Moroccan media outlets reported that investigators have video surveillance footage showing three suspects putting up a tent near the victims’ tent and leaving the area after the slayings. Other tourists found the women with stab wounds in their necks and alerted police, according to national media in Morocco. The killings were “politically motivated and thus an act of terror,” Denmark’s Loekke Rasmussen said, without identifying the potential motives. “There are still dark forces that want to fight our values” and “we must not give in.” In neighboring Norway, Prime Minister Erna Solberg said terrorism “is not the only lead that is being investigated in Morocco,” but the case “emphasizes the importance of combating violent extremism.” “We trust that Moroccan authorities are doing their utmost to arrest those responsible for the murders,” she said at a news conference. Preliminary findings from the investigation “indicate, according to Moroccan authorities, that the killings may be related to the terrorist organization the Islamic State group,” Denmark’s domestic security agency said in a statement to The Associated Press. The slayings have shocked Morocco, a popular tourist destination where attacks on foreigners are extremely rare. In the capital of Rabat, government spokesman Mustapha El Khalfi said Morocco condemned “this terrorist, criminal act.” “It is an unacceptable act that does not fit with the values and traditions of Moroccan people nor the traditions of the area where the crime happened,” Khalfi said Thursday. It is a denounced, condemned act.” A national security official who asked not to be named because he wasn’t authorized to speak to the media identified the suspects to The Associated Press as Abdessamad Ejjoud, born in 1993; Younes Ouziad, born in 1991; and Rashid Aftati, born in 1986. They had knives and slingshots when they were arrested, the official said. Morocco is generally considered safe for tourists but has battled with Islamic extremism for years. More than a thousand Moroccans are believed to have joined the Islamic State group. An anti-terrorism rally is being planned for Saturday in Rabat."	Terrorism	Terrorism
ISIS Christmas warning urges followers to 'kill crusaders in their festivals'	"ISIS have urged all Muslims to 'kill crusaders in their festivals' over the Christmas period. It comes as tourists in Barcelona were warned of potential Christmas Day terror attack by bus driver. Officers have been told the Casablanca-born terrorist may try to commit a spectacular massacre in the Catalan capital using a coach or similar type of vehicle. At a Christmas market in Strasbourg earlier this month gunman Cherif Chekatt killed five before fleeing the scene. He was shot and killed days later - but had recorded a video pledging himself to Islamic State. The terrorist group, still fighting coalition forces in Syria, wants Muslims to 'kill crusaders' over the festive period as they increasingly rely on lone wolf-style attacks. The revelation surfaced after the US state department tweeted: ""Spain. Exercise heightened caution around areas of vehicle movement including buses in the Las Ramblas area of Barcelona during Christmas and New Year. ""Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, and other public areas."" Donald Trump recently announced that he was withdrawing roughly 2,000 US troops from Syria saying that ISIS had been 'defeated'. The decision led to Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis quitting his key role and issuing a scathing rebuke in his resignation letter. Trump later partially walked back his earlier tweet and said that Turkey had the means to defeat the Islamic State. The US president has also lost envoy Brett McGurk. The US special presidential envoy for the global coalition to defeat the militant group, submitted his resignation effective December 31 to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday, a State Department official said. McGurk, who was slated to leave his post in February 2019, objected to Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, a person familiar with the matter said, and added that Mattis' departure had a ""significant impact"" on McGurk's resignation. Trump, for his part, tweeted late Saturday that McGurk had simply moved up the date of his resignation and added: ""Grandstander?"" ""The Fake News is making such a big deal about this nothing event!"" he said on Twitter. McGurk was appointed by Obama in 2015 and has been instrumental in shaping Washington's policy in northern Syria, particularly its backing of Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militia that have been fighting Islamic State with US support for three years. Trump's declaration of triumph has alarmed key NATO allies such as France and Germany, who said the change of course on Syria risks damaging the fight against Islamic State, which has now been squeezed to a sliver of Syrian territory."

Scandinavian student murders: nine more arrested in Morocco	"Nine more people have been arrested in Morocco over links to the four initial suspects in the murder of two Scandinavian university students in a remote corner of the Atlas mountains, authorities said. A total of 13 men have been detained after the murder of the female hikers from Denmark and Norway. Moroccan authorities are treating the killings as a terrorist act. The women’s bodies were found on Monday with stab wounds to their necks. Morocco’s central bureau of judicial investigations said the nine new suspects had been carrying arms and “suspicious materials” used in the manufacture of explosives at the time of their arrests. No further details were available. The remains of the Danish student Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, and 28-year-old Norwegian Maren Ueland were put on a plane that left Casablanca for Copenhagen on Friday. Both women had lived in southern Norway, where they attended university. Moroccan authorities said on Thursday the four initial suspects arrested after the murder had pledged allegiance to Islamic State. The bodies of the two women were found on Monday. The pair had pitched their tent in an isolated mountain area two hours’ walk from the tourist village of Imlil. One of them had been beheaded, according to a source close to the investigation. Imlil is a starting point for trekking and climbing tours of Mount Toubkal, which at 4,167 metres is the highest summit in north Africa. Detectives are investigating a link to Islamic extremism after a video emerged showing the suspects pledging allegiance to Isis, the Rabat prosecutor has said. Authorities are also working to determine the authenticity of a video posted on social media that allegedly shows the murder of one of the tourists, according to the prosecutor. “At this point, there is no tangible evidence that the video is not authentic,” Norway’s criminal investigations agency, Kripos, said on Friday. The first four suspects to be arrested were detained in Marrakesh, an hour away from the scene of the murders. Younes Ouaziad, 27, lived with his parents in the Al-Azzouzia neighbourhood. His family and neighbours said on Friday that they were in shock. “He was a boy without any history, private. There was nothing to suggest he could do something like that,” Abdelaati, 35, a vegetable seller in the neighbourhood, said. Authorities in Denmark and Norway have condemned the murders. The Danish prime minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, denounced what he called a “beastly crime”. Norway’s prime minister, Erna Solberg, spoke of a “brutal and meaningless attack on innocents”. A Moroccan government spokesman, Mustapha Khalfi, described the killings as a “terrorist act” while the prime minister, Saadeddine Othmani, said it was a “stab in the back of Morocco and Moroccans”. Tourism is a cornerstone of Morocco’s economy, accounting for 10% of national income. The country has been spared jihadist attacks since 2011, when a bomb attack on a cafe in Marrakesh’s Jamaa El Fna Square killed 17 people, most of them European tourists."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Netanyahu says Israel is Arabs’ ‘ally’ against Iran	"RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan 1 — Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said yesterday that Arab countries viewed Israel as an “indispensable ally” fighting Iran and the Islamic State group. That evaluation, he told Brazil’s Globo TV during a visit to Rio, has caused “a revolution in relations with the Arab world.” The comments came as Israel has stepped up air strikes on Iranian positions in neighbouring Syria, and as Israel digested an abrupt decision by President Donald Trump to withdraw US troops from Syria. Netanyahu has repeatedly warned that Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons to destroy his country. Israel, he said, had shown itself to be active in battling “radical Islam, violent Islam — either the one led by radical Shiites led by Iran, or the one led by the radical Sunnis led by Daesh (IS) and Al-Qaeda.” “Unfortunately we have not made any advance with the Palestinians. Half of them are already under the gun of Iran and of radical Islam,” Netanyahu added. Asked if he could ever contemplate sitting down with an Iranian leader to talk peace, Netanyahu replied: “If Iran remains committed to our destruction the answer is no.” The only way, he said, would be “if Iran undergoes a total transformation.” Netanyahu was in Brazil to attend today’s inauguration of the Latin American country’s new, pro-Israel president, Jair Bolsonaro. On the sidelines of the ceremony, Netanyahu was to hold talks with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is also among the visiting dignitaries. They were expected to discuss the US troop pullout from Syria and Iranian activities in the Middle East. — AFP"	Terrorism	Terrorism
 IS-inspired group eyed in blast	" COTABATO CITY—Military and police officials are looking at an Islamic State-inspired group as possibly behind the blast that killed two people and injured more than 30 others outside a shopping mall here on New Year’s Eve. Maj. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, commander of the Army’s 6th Infantry Division, said the attack was apparently a retaliation for his unit’s offensive against the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) and a group that had broken away from it, the Daulah Islamiyah. Both groups have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) jihadi group in Iraq and Syria. A homemade bomb packed with cut nails and ball bearings went off in front of the baggage counter at the entrance to South Seas Mall along Don Rufino Alonzo Avenue at 1:59 p.m. on Monday, killing the driver of a member of the Bangsamoro Transition Commission (BTC) and a woman who was about to enter the shopping mall. The fatalities were identified on Tuesday as Jonathan Tasic Torribiano, 39, driver of BTC Commissioner Melanio Ulama, and Miriam Wahab Kali, 31, of Barangay Poblacion 2, Cotabato City. Malacañang vowed that justice would be served. “We empathize with the families, relatives and friends of those who suffered from this unhappy occurrence. To them, we vow that we will get to the bottom of this at the soonest possible time,” presidential spokesperson Salvador Panelo said in a statement. The bomb went off as people were doing last-minute shopping for the traditional New Year celebrations. Officials said on Tuesday that 34 other people were injured in the blast. Three of them were in critical condition, they said. Scattered debris, including items sold for New Year’s Eve revelry such as horns made of cardboard and plastic, gifts and a bloody slipper lay at the shopping mall’s entrance. Windows of surrounding buildings were shattered by the blast. Sobejana said a man was seen carrying a box that he left in front of the baggage counter of the shopping mall. It exploded a few seconds later. The explosion prompted police to search the shopping mall, leading to the discovery of another bomb, which they destroyed, said Chief Insp. Rowell Zafra, spokesperson for the local police. Sobejana said the bomb that went off had the signature of the Daulah Islamiyah. He said the military had some “leads” in the attack but did not elaborate. Abu Misry Mama, spokesperson for the BIFF and the Daulah Islamiyah, said on Tuesday that neither group had a hand in the blast. Senior Supt. Rolly Octavio, city police director, said investigators were reviewing images captured by security cameras at the shopping mall for leads. Octavio said a security camera captured the image of the man who left the second bomb at the shopping mall’s baggage counter. He said bomb experts recovered about a kilo of cut nails, a plastic container with traces of black powder, and cell-phone parts. Cotabato City Mayor Cynthia Guiani-Sayadi on Tuesday claimed the authorities had “information about the suspects,” but had yet to determine the motive for the attack. Sayadi said the city had been put on lockdown, with a “no ID, no entry” policy being enforced at checkpoints and all points of exit and entry into the city. Jerome Succor Aba, a spokesperson for Suara Bangsamoro, said the rush to accuse IS-inspired militants even before an investigation could be carried out would justify a military takeover of Cotabato City and other Muslim-majority areas in Mindanao as residents prepared for a plebiscite to ratify the proposed charter of a new Muslim autonomous region on the island. The plebiscite for the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), which would establish the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, is set for Jan. 21 and Feb. 6. Aba said a military takeover could limit the campaign for the plebiscite or even lead to the cancellation of the vote for security reasons. Lt. Gen. Benjamin Madrigal, chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, condemned the bombing and gave assurance of full military cooperation with the Philippine National Police in the investigation of the attack. Responding to criticism that the blast happened despite the extension of martial law in Mindanao for another year, Col. Noel Detoyato, chief of the AFP public affairs office, said, “It could have been worse without martial law.” President Duterte placed Mindanao under martial law in May 2017 to crush IS-inspired local terrorists who seized Marawi City in Lanao del Sur province. Congress has extended military rule on the island three times on the President’s request, the latest up to Dec. 31, 2019. Gov. Mujiv Hataman of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao called the perpetrators of the explosion “evil,” and urged residents of the region to pray for the people of Cotabato City. “Evil acts like this will be punished in this world and the next, while all good deeds will be rewarded,” Hataman said. Murad Ebrahim, chief of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which has signed a peace agreement with the government and is leading the campaign for the ratification of the proposed Bangsamoro charter, also condemned the attack, describing it as “an act of cowardice, inhuman and atrocious.” —WITH REPORTS FROM JEANNETTE I.

Police hunt across eastern France for Strasbourg Christmas market attacker Manila Bulletin News	"STRASBOURG, France (Reuters) – Police searched through eastern France on Wednesday for a man suspected of killing at least two people in a gun attack on a Christmas market in Strasbourg and who was known to have been religiously radicalized while in jail. Witnesses told investigators the assailant cried out “Allahu Akbar” (God is Greater) as he launched his attack on the market, the Paris prosecutor said. The prosecutor, Remy Heitz, also suggested the suspect may have chosen his target for its religious symbolism. “Considering the target, his way of operating, his profile and the testimonies of those who heard him yell ‘Allahu Akbar’, the anti-terrorist police has been called into action,” Heitz told a news conference. Police issued a wanted poster for the suspect identifying him as Strasbourg-born Cherif Chekatt, 29, who is on an intelligence services watch list as a potential security risk. An investigation had been opened into alleged murder with terrorist intent and suspected ties to terrorist networks with intent to commit crimes, Heitz said. Two people were killed and a third person was brain-dead and being kept alive on life support, he said. Six other victims were fighting for their lives. France raised its security threat to the highest alert level, strengthening controls on its border with Germany as elite commandos backed by helicopters hunted for the suspect. French and German agents checked vehicles and public transport crossing the Rhine river, along which the Franco-German frontier runs, backing up traffic in both directions. Hundreds of French troops and police were taking part in the manhunt. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said an additional 1,800 soldiers would be put on anti-terror security patrols with a special focus on Christmas markets. Sylvaine Jardin, director of the Porcus charcuterie, just metres from where the shooting took place struggled to hold back tears saying she needed to work so as not to think about what had happened. “We can’t let ourselves be submerged by fear, but we’ll feel better when he is caught,” she said, adding that traders had last year been given training and advice in preparation for a possible attack. SERIAL CONVICT The gunman struck at about 1900 GMT on Tuesday, just as the picturesque Christmas market in the historic city was shutting down. He engaged in two gunfights with security forces as he evaded a police dragnet and bragged about his acts to the driver of a taxi that he commandeered, prosecutor Heitz said. No one has yet claimed responsibility, but the U.S.-based Site intelligence group, which monitors jihadist websites, said Islamic State supporters were celebrating. French and German security officials painted a portrait of Chekatt as a serial law-breaker who had racked up more than two dozen convictions in France, Germany and Switzerland, and served time in prison. “It was during these spells in jail that we detected a radicalization in his religious practices. But we there were never signs he was preparing an attack,” Deputy Interior Minister Laurent Nunez said. One German security source said the suspect was jailed in southern Germany from August 2016 to February 2017 for aggravated theft but was released before the end of his 27-month sentence so that he could be deported to France. “He was banned from re-entering Germany at the same time”, the security source in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg said. “We don’t have any knowledge of any kind of radicalization.” BORDER CONTROLS The attack took place at a testing time for President Emmanuel Macron, who is struggling to quell a month-long public revolt over high living costs that has spurred the worst public unrest in central Paris since the 1968 student riots. The disclosure that Chekatt was on a security watchlist will raise questions over possible intelligence failures, though some 26,000 individuals suspected of posing a security risk to France are on the “S File” list. Of these, about 10,000 are believed to have been radicalized, sometimes in fundamentalist Salafist Muslim mosques, in jail or abroad. Police had raided the suspect’s home early on Tuesday in connection with a homicide investigation. Five people were detained and under interrogation as part of that investigation. At the Europa Bridge, the main border crossing in the region used by commuters traveling in both directions, armed police inspected vehicles. Police were also checking pedestrians and trains arriving in Germany from Strasbourg. Secular France has for years grappled with how to respond to both homegrown jihadists and foreign militants following attacks in Paris, Nice, Marseille and beyond. In 2016, a truck plowed into a Bastille Day crowd in Nice, killing more than 80 people. In November 2015, coordinated Islamist militant attacks on the Bataclan concert hall and other sites in Paris claimed about 130 lives. There have also been attacks in Paris on police on the Champs-Elysees avenue, the offices of satirical weekly publication Charlie Hebdo and a kosher store. A man drove a trunk into a crowd at a Christmas market in Berlin in December 2016, killing 12 people."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Rubble and charred cars in former Syria jihadist hub	"HAJIN (Syria), Dec 17 — Burnt-out cars, craters and collapsed buildings dot the side of a road in the Syrian village of Hajin, after US-backed forces expelled the Islamic State group. The sound of mortar fire and flying bullets resounded inside Hajin on Saturday, as huge clouds of grey smoke billowed over the outskirts of the large village in eastern Syria. The yellow flag of the Syrian Democratic Forces flew above one building, after the Kurdish-led fighters seized the village from IS jihadists on Friday. “Hajin has come under the control of our forces,” SDF commander Zanar Awaz said. “We are now fighting on the outskirts of Hajin and we are preparing to enter nearby villages,” he said in Kurdish, a shot of white in his short black hair. “We will finish off this terrorist group.” Hajin lies on the east bank of the Euphrates in the eastern province of Deir Ezzor, about 30 kilometres from the border with Iraq. The village’s capture marks a milestone in a massive and costly operation backed by a US-led coalition to expel IS from eastern Syria. On Saturday, armoured vehicles brought in SDF fighters to reinforce the front lines outside Hajin, as coalition planes and helicopters flew overhead. An SDF fighter sitting on the top of a vehicle with fellow combatants flashed a victory sign. The Kurdish-led SDF launched an offensive in September to expel IS from a pocket including its main village Hajin, but their advance has been fraught with obstacles. “We’ve been facing a lot of difficulties: IS car bombs, suicide attackers. Most of them are foreign,” Awaz said. On Saturday morning, IS launched a counterattack, but the SDF said it succeeded in repelling them with the backing of coalition air strikes. Since the start of the operation on September 10, at least 930 jihadists and more than 540 SDF fighters have been killed, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said. In addition, more than 320 civilians have lost their lives, many in coalition air strikes, according to the Observatory. The coalition has however repeatedly denied targeting civilians. But no civilians were visible in Hajin on Saturday, after thousands fled the village and nearby areas. A convoy of armoured cars ferried in US soldiers, churning up dust along the way. On a hill that used to act as the village cemetery, tunnels and trenches dug by the jihadists lay covered in sheets and colourful blankets. SDF fighter Bahouz, who did not give his last name, remembered first entering the district’s hospital. He said he took pictures of the dead jihadists he saw there. “They think they’ll go to paradise, but we killed them,” he said, carrying a gun and hand grenades around his waist. “Death is their destiny as they destroyed everything.” IS swept across large swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq in 2014, implementing their brutal interpretation of Islamic law in areas they controlled. But they have since seen their dream of a state crumble, as they have lost most of that territory to various offensives. In Syria, IS fighters are holding out in what remains of the pocket that once included Hajin, including the villages of Al-Shaafa and Sousa. They have also retained a presence in the vast Badia desert, but that front is managed by Russia-backed regime forces. According to the Observatory, a total of 17,000 SDF fighters are involved in the fight to seize the eastern pocket, compared to around 2,000 jihadists. Inside Hajin village, SDF fighter Mohammed al-Mohammed said his spirits were high. “There’s only a bit left” to capture from IS, said the 19-year-old. “We will head on to Al-Shaafa and Sousa to liberate them and win, God willing.” — AFP"	Terrorism	Terrorism
Macron visits Strasbourg as police probe potential accomplices	"STRASBOURG, Dec 15 — French President Emmanuel Macron visited Strasbourg yesterday, a day after police shot dead a gunman who killed four people at the city’s Christmas market, as investigators probe whether the jihadist had any accomplices. Macron placed a white rose on the Kleber monument, which has become a makeshift memorial in the centre of the city with thousands of candles, flowers and messages, as soldiers sang the Marseillaise national anthem. “The whole nation stands with the people of Strasbourg. This is what I wanted to tell them tonight,” said Macron, who had earlier taken part in a European Union summit in Brussels. Annette, 80, one of the hundreds attending the Strasbourg memorial, said she “came to pray for those who are no longer here”. The eastern French city near the German border slowly began to return to normality yesterday, with its famous Christmas market reopening after 29-year-old Cherif Chekatt, a small-time criminal turned jihadist, went on a shooting spree there on Tuesday evening. He shot dead a Thai tourist, on holiday in Strasbourg with his wife, an Afghan who sought refuge in France some 20 years ago, a 28-year-old Italian journalist in town to cover the European parliament, and a local Frenchman who had just retired. Twelve people were also wounded in his attack, including one who has been declared brain-dead. The Islamic State group’s propaganda arm said in a Twitter post that Chekatt was one of its “soldiers”, a claim which was dismissed yesterday by France’s Interior Minister Christophe Castaner as “completely opportunistic”. France’s anti-terror prosecutor Remy Heitz said the investigation was now focusing on whether anyone “helped or encouraged Chekatt preparing or carrying out” the attack — or assisted him while he was on the run. Seven people were in police custody yesterday, including Chekatt’s parents and two brothers, Heitz said. Another brother, who like Chekatt was on France’s anti-terror watchlist for suspected extremists, has been detained in Algeria, sources close to the inquiry told AFP. Officials praised the massive public help and quick police reaction that led to the death of Chekatt, a career criminal with 27 convictions in four countries, late on Thursday. He was tracked down at around 9:00 pm (2000 GMT) when a police patrol spotted him on a street in the Neudorf district where he was last seen after his gun and knife attack on Tuesday night. Around 800 people called in tips to a hotline after the authorities released his name and photo Wednesday night. Two calls in particular were “decisive” in finding Chekatt, Heitz said. The information allowed police to cordon off an area while a helicopter equipped with a heat-seeking camera flew over the gardens. Spotted by a police patrol, Chekatt tried to escape by entering a building. Unable to get in the door, he turned and shot at the three officers with a handgun as they tried to approach. Two police officers returned fire and killed him, Heitz told a press conference in Strasbourg. Questions remain over how Chekatt was able to evade the tight security perimetre set up around the Christmas market, a prime target for jihadist groups. Around 500 police, security agents and soldiers control access at checkpoints on the bridges leading to the river island, a UN World Heritage site, that houses the market. The goal is to “create a bubble with searches at the entry points,” Mayor Roland Ries said after the attack, while regional government representative Jean-Luc Marx said he had not determined “any flaws in the security measures”. France has been on high alert since the start of a wave of jihadist attacks in 2015, which prompted a threefold surge in the security budget for the market, to one million euros. Chekatt, a Strasbourg native who lived in a rundown apartment block a short drive from the city centre, was flagged by French security forces in 2015 as a possible Islamic extremist. But Defence Minister Florence Parly rejected criticism that Chekatt’s presence on the extremist watchlist should have prompted a more proactive reaction from the authorities. “You can’t... arrest someone just because you think he might do something,” Parly told Radio Classique yesterday. Strasbourg’s deputy mayor Alain Fontanel admitted that despite patrols, plainclothes police, profilers and video surveillance, “the risks can be reduced, but not eliminated”. “We can’t pat down and search everyone, only carry out random checks,” he said, adding that huge lines at checkpoints would only create a new potential target for terrorists. “Someone who wants to get in an area this big with a weapon can do it,” he said. — AFP"	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Most Islamic State commanders in Mosul already killed, Iraqi general says"	"A civilian walks next to a vehicle of the Iraqi Special Operations Forces (ISOF) as he leaves the city to escape from clashes during a battle with Islamic State militants, in al-Zirai district in Mosul, Iraq, January 19, 2017. — Reuters pic MOSUL, Jan 19 —Most Islamic State (IS) commanders in Mosul have been killed in battles with Iraqi government forces that raged over the past three months in the eastern side of the city, an Iraqi general said today. The fight to take the western side of Mosul, which remains under the jihadists’ control, should not be more difficult than the one on the eastern side, Lieutenant-General Abdul Ghani al-Assadi told Reuters before embarking on a tour of areas newly retaken. Assadi’s Counter-Terrorism Service announced yesterday that almost all of the city’s eastern half had been brought under government control. “God willing, there will be a meeting in the next few days attended by all the commanders concerned with liberation operations,” he said, replying to a question on when he expects a thrust into the western side of Mosul to begin. “It will not be harder than what we have seen. The majority of (IS) commanders have been killed in the eastern side.” He did not give further details. Since late 2015, government forces backed by US-led coalition air power have wrested back large amounts of northern and western territory overrun by IS in a shock 2014 offensive. On Thursday, regular Iraqi army troops captured the Nineveh Oberoy hotel, the so-called “palaces” area on the eastern bank of the Tigris, and Tel Kef, a small town just to the north according to military statements in Baghdad. The army is still battling militants in al-Arabi, the last district which remains under their control east of the river, said one of the statements. Over 50 watercraft and barges used by Islamic State to supply their units east of the river were destroyed in air strikes, the US envoy to the coalition, Brett McGurty, tweeted. Mogul’s five bridges across the Tigris had already been partially damaged by US-led air strikes to slow the militants’ movement, before Islamic State blew up two of them. “God willing, there will be an announcement in the next few days that all the eastern bank is under control,” Assai said. A Reuters correspondent saw army troops deploying in an area by the river as mortar and gun fire rang out further north. On one of the streets newly recaptured from Islamic State, men were reassembling breeze blocks into a wall that was blown up by a suicide car bomb several days ago. Prime Minister Hailer al-Badri said late on Tuesday that Islamic State had been severely weakened in the Mosul campaign, and the military had begun moving against it in the western half. He did not elaborate. If the US-backed campaign is successful it will likely spell the end of the Iraqi part of the self-styled caliphate declared by the ultra-hardline Islamic State in 2014, which extends well into neighbouring Syria. Several thousand civilians have been killed or wounded in the Mosul fighting since October. — Reuters"	Terrorism	Terrorism
Islamic State cells in nearly all Indonesian provinces — military chief	"The Islamic State militant group has a presence in nearly all provinces across Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority country, the military chief in Jakarta has said. General Gatot Nurmantyo’s comments late on Monday that there are clandestine “sleeper” cells across the sprawling Indonesian archipelago underscored concerns about Islamic State’s growing influence in Southeast Asia. “After observation, we see that in almost every province … there are already IS cells, but they are sleeper cells,” Nurmantyo told reporters in the capital, Jakarta. He singled out the predominantly Christian province of Papua as one of the few exceptions. “These sleeper cells can easily join up with other radical cells,” he said. Governments across the region have been on high alert since Islamic State-linked militants, mostly from Southeast Asian countries, overran a city in the southern Philippines about three weeks ago. The Philippine military, which has carried out air strikes and raids in Marawi city, said on Tuesday the militants still control about 20 percent of the city. Indonesian and Malaysian officials have stepped up security to prevent militants from escaping from Marawi over their shared borders with the Philippines. “It’s easy to jump from Marawi to Indonesia and we must all beware of sleeper cells being activated in Indonesia,” Nurmantyo said. Southeast Asian nations believe the region is home to thousands of Islamic State sympathizers, and Indonesia and Malaysia have detained scores of suspected militants in recent years. Singapore said on Monday it had detained an assistant child-care worker suspected of trying to join Islamic State, the first woman to be held on such charges in Singapore. A gun-and-bomb attack that killed four people in Jakarta last year marked the first Islamic State strike in the region.

Sona 2 blasts ‘state enemies’	"PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte took aim at communist rebels and Islamic State extremists in his second State of the Nation Address Monday, saying the enemies of the state deserve to be “bullied” with the full might of the government. “Times have changed because God placed me here. They call me a bully. You sons of whores, I’m really a bully, especially to the enemies of the state,” the President said in Filipino, in an expletive-laced speech that ran for more than two hours. Duterte recently called off peace talks with the communist rebels, after New People’s Army rebels ambushed a military convoy that included his security group. The President went off script and peppered his speech with expletives as he took potshots at the communist movement and his former professor, Jose Maria Sison, the founding chairman of the Communist Party of the Philippines, who is in self-exile in the Netherlands. He also said the peace talks were becoming expensive for Norway, which has agreed to broker the negotiations. “It’s expensive because those crazies keep going back and forth like tourists,” he said, referring to the communist negotiators. “They don’t say anything, then when they come here, they say they want this, and want that. Lulu mo,” he said, using a Visayan phrase that means to go masturbate. He also slammed the communist New People’s Army for attcking members of his security detail in Arakan, North Cotabato. “Even my policemen, you ambush them every day. And you even want to kill me, because that was my convoy you fired on with a machine gun,” he said, while acknowledging that he was far away from the scene of the ambush. In an unprecedented move, Duterte confronted leftist protesters near the Batasang Pambansa after his Sona, and said they could talk peace only if both sides respected the other. He also dared anyone with a gun to shoot him there and then. “Respect? You’d ambush me. We should all suffer. Who has a gun? Fire away. Go ahead, I’ll catch it and send it back to you crazies,” he said in Filipino. Toward the end of his speech to the protesters, he asked for more time for his administration to continue with the reforms, noting that he had accepted leftists into his Cabinet.  Then he cursed again at the NPA ambush of his convoy. “You want to kill even me. If I die, who will you talk peace with? My spirit?” he said in Filipino. Over the weekend, Duterte said he will no longer talk peace with the communists and ordered the military to train its guns on the New People’s Army after it has retaken Marawi City from Islamist terrorists. Duterte also said that the NDF was no longer interested in pursuing talks amid its continued criticism of some of his policies and the NPA’s relentless attacks on state troops. He ordered the arrest of all NDF consultants who were given temporary freedom to hold talks with the government.The Office of the Solicitor General earlier asked the Supreme Court and several regional trial courts handling the cases against the communist leaders to recall the bail given them, after backchannel talks were called off Wednesday amid the renewed attacks by communist rebels, including one against members of Duterte’s security detail. Duterte also accused communists of abuses when a leftist group occupied housing units intended for soldiers. “The left is too much. You build a house and they will steal it,” he said in Filipino. “And you try to intimidate me by saying you will occupy the streets? I’ll give you six months there. Don’t you leave,” he said. Duterte was referring to an urban poor group, Kadamay, that had forcibly occupied thousands of housing units that were intended for soldiers and policemen. In the same speech, Duterte reiterated that the government is determined to finish off jihadist forces lurking in Mindanao, where martial law has been extended to the end of the year. “I declared martial law in Mindanao because I believed that that was the fastest way to quell the rebellion at the least cost of lives and properties,” Duterte said. “At the same time, the government would be adequately equipped with the constitutional tool not only to prevent the escape of rebels who can easily mingle and pretend to be civilian evacuees only to re-group in another place to fight another day, but also to prevent them from spreading their gospel of hate and violence in the rest of Mindanao.” “To decisively address insurgency and terrorism, we are working doubly hard towards [achieving] a stronger and more credible national defense system for the country. We continue to strengthen the defense capability of the AFP as a deterrence against terrorists, lawless elements, and other threats,” he added.  He also reiterated his support for and commitment to the military and for those who are on the ground.  “The people of Marawi need help. Caught in the crossfire between government troops and Muslim extremists, they have been through hell and we need to help them rise and move forward,” he said.  “If we cannot provide for the poor and the needy who are many, then we will not be able to keep from harm the rich who are few,” he added.  At a press conference after his SONA, Duterte rejected the possibility of putting the entire nation under martial law, saying this would make him look stupid. Duterte also acknowledged there was a failure of intelligence in Marawi City, which was overrun by Islamic State-inspired terrorists. “There was a failure of intelligence. There were tunnels. Maute was stocking explosives. There was a mistake in the evaluation or assessment,” Duterte said."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Islamic State group claims Las Vegas attack	"BEIRUT, Lebanon—The Islamic State group claimed Monday that the shooting massacre in Las Vegas was carried out by one of its “soldiers” who had “converted to Islam” months ago. “The executor of the Las Vegas attack is a soldier of the Islamic State and he carried out the operation as a response” to calls to target countries fighting the jihadists, Islamic State’s propaganda outlet Amaq said on the Telegram online messaging service. It dubbed 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, who shot dead at least 58 people from a high-rise hotel window on the Las Vegas Strip, a “soldier of the caliphate” with the nom de guerre Abu Abdel Bar al-Amriki. READ: Sniper in high-rise hotel kills at least 58, injures 515 in Las Vegas “The author of the Las Vegas attack converted to Islam a few months ago,” Amaq said in a series of messages. “From a hotel overlooking a music concert, [Paddock] opened fire on one of the groups, leaving 600 dead or injured, until using up his ammunition and becoming a martyr.” The group provided no evidence to back up its claims, and US security officials remained cautious amid no other signs to connect Paddock to the jihadists. Early in their investigation police said they had no information to link him with international terror groups. In response to a query, Central Intelligence Agency spokesman Jonathan Liu said they were aware of the Islamic state claim. “We advise caution on jumping to conclusions before the facts are in,” Liu said. Islamic State has moved quickly to claim credit for a number of recent attacks around the world, suggesting the “soldiers” were acting under their inspiration. However, said Lorenzo Vidino, director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, they have also made a number of false claims, including that they were behind a robbery in a Manila casino in June, and what turned out to be a neo-Nazi attack on a Russian FSB intelligence service office in Khabarovsk in April. “Especially recently, they have claimed responsibility for very random stuff that they had nothing to do with,” Vidino said. “For a long time they have embellished real events. They twist the foundation of truth.” Such claims have gained pace as Islamic State finds its hold on its “caliphate” territory in Iraq and Syria greatly shrunk in the face of US-guided coalition assaults. Almost fully expelled from their one-time bastion in Raqa, Syria, coalition leaders say they are preparing for a final siege against the remnants of the jihadist army in the Middle Euphrates River Valley spanning Syria and Iraq. On Friday Islamic State released an audio recording of what it said was its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi calling on jihadists in Syria and Iraq to “resist” their enemies. That was seen as a move to boost the morale of its fighters in Syria and Iraq. Even if the group is defeated in its base area, anti-terror experts say they do not expect that will end its global reach. Despite their battlefield losses, “the ISIS ability to reach globally is still largely intact,” Nick Rasmussen, director of the US National Counterterrorism Center, said last week. On Sunday the group claimed responsibility for an attack in Marseille, France where a young man stabbed two women to death before he was shot by security officials. But by Monday afternoon it had not claimed the attack in Edmonton, Canada, in which a Somali refugee attacked a policeman on Saturday with a knife and then hit four people with a truck."

"ISIS fighter with American accent urges supporters to take advantage of US gun laws, United States News & Top Stories"	"WASHINGTON (WASHINGTON POST) - In a video released on Wednesday (Dec 27) by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) militant group, a one-legged fighter identified by the group as an American called on Muslims in the United States to ""take advantage"" of the country's gun laws to obtain weapons and carry out attacks. The fighter, identified as ""Abu Salih al-Amriki,"" wears khaki fatigues with a holstered pistol in the online video, which was published by a propaganda wing of ISIS. He speaks in English with what sounded like a New York City-area accent. ""Take advantage of the fact that you can easily obtain a rifle or a pistol in America,"" the fighter implored. ""Spray the kuffar (infidels) with bullets so that their fear of the Muslims rises and they continue to reveal their hatred towards Islam."" The Site Intelligence Group, a private organisation that tracks Islamist militant media, published a copy of the video in which Abu Salih also called President Donald Trump a ""dog of Rome"". ""You entered into the White House on the back of your crusader rhetoric which the fake media has pressured you to tone down,"" the fighter said. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security had no immediate comment on Abu Salih's identity nor the potential threat of his entreaties to violence. But the possibility that ISIS followers in the United States will acquire powerful weapons by legal means has been a growing concern of American counterterrorism officials. Just last week, the outgoing director of the National Counterterrorism Centre, Nicholas Rasmussen, told reporters that permissive US gun laws enable mass murders who want to carry out large-scale attacks. ""We find ourselves in a more dangerous situation because our population of violent extremists has no difficulty gaining access to weapons that are quite lethal,"" Rasmussen said. ""I wish that weren't so."" The video released on Wednesday begins with Abu Salih slipping on what looks like a prosthetic leg and pushing himself up on crutches. A bullet-scarred cityscape of demolished buildings appears in the background as he launches into his statement, which also urges other wounded and disabled militants to keep fighting. It was not immediately clear where or when Abu Salih's statement was recorded. The slickly produced video is part of a recent series the militant group has dubbed Inside The Caliphate that has featured mainly foreign militants threatening attacks. A montage of beheadings and bombings follows Abu Salih's statement, set to a soundtrack of militants chanting. The recent videos were produced by the ISIS' al-Hayat Media Centre, which has published some of the group's most high-profile material targeting Western audiences. Its online magazine Rumiyah is published in several languages, including English, and often features calls for attacks in the West. The group has urged followers to kill with any tools at their disposal, including vehicles, and the group claimed responsibility for the Oct 31 truck attack that killed eight people along a bike path in Lower Manhattan. In Wednesday's video Abu Salih also tells attackers to ""get a knife and slice the throat of the (infidels) so that they know that the blood of the Muslims is not cheap."" The group's media output has waned, however, as it loses prime territory in Iraq and Syria, where it once declared an Islamic caliphate. Before Wednesday's release, the most recent of the Inside The Caliphate series urged ISIS followers to be patient following the ""blood spilled"" in Syria and Iraq. It also encouraged supporters everywhere to ""rise against the (infidels)."""	Terrorism	Terrorism
NTT policeman turns gun on himself in apparent suicide attempt	"Adj. First Insp. Fransisco De Araujo, the head of the Vital Installation Security Unit for the Kupang Kota Police in East Nusa Tenggara (NTT), was found in critical condition in his house in Oebobo district, Kupang, on Tuesday morning after he apparently shot himself in the head. “We are still investigating the reason why he shot himself,” NTT Police spokesman Adj. Sr. Comr. Jules Abast told The Jakarta Post. A witness, Saladin, heard a gunshot at about 7.30 a.m. “Along with the victim’s neighbors, they forcefully opened his room’s door, which was locked from inside,” Jules said. Fransisco was found lying on a bed with a bullet wound to the head. “We have seized the pistol, which was found on the floor,” the spokesman added. The man has been treated at the Bhayangkara Hospital, Kupang. A criminal expert from Nusa Cendana University, Dedy Manafe, said the police needed to conduct annual psychological tests on every officer who carried firearms. “Many police officers suffered from psychological disorder because of pressure, such as financial problems or receiving punishment from superiors. If an officer is found to be not mentally fit, his or her firearm must be withdrawn,” he said. (bbs)"	Terrorism	Terrorism
Terror fears prompt first Australia gun amnesty in 20 years	"The government believes there are as many as 260,00 illicit weapons on the streets, and with the threat of extremist attacks and a spate of gangland shootings, it wants to minimise the danger. ""We are living in a time when our national security environment has deteriorated. Unfortunately, we have seen, through terror attacks in Australia, that illegal guns have been used,"" said Justice Minister Michael Keenan ""We believe... now is the time to run another amnesty, with the aim of reducing this pool of illegal guns."" Australian officials have grown increasingly concerned over the threat of extremist attacks and have prevented 12 on home soil since September 2014. But five have taken place, mostly with guns, including a fatal shootout in Melbourne this month claimed by the Islamic State group. The amnesty will run from July 1 until September 30, allowing people to hand in unregistered or unwanted firearms with no questions asked. Outside that period people face fines of up to Aus$280,000 (US$212,000) or 14 years jail. While individual states periodically run amnesties, this is the first national one since 35 people died at the historic Tasmanian colonial convict site of Port Arthur in 1996. The massacre, when lone gunman Martin Bryant went on the rampage armed with semi-automatic weapons, shocked Australia and then-prime minister John Howard enacted tougher gun laws, including bans on certain weapons, a minimum ownership age, and licences. Gun control measures continue to have strong public support in Australia. More than 600,000 weapons were destroyed in the aftermath of the Port Arthur attack, during a gun buy-back in which compensation was offered. No money is on offer this time and Keenan admitted many hardened criminals were unlikely to hand in their weapons. But he voiced hope some would heed the call. ""When we have had state-based amnesties, we have seen guns handed in in the thousands and my expectation is this will get a similar sort of number,"" he said. All guns in Australia must be registered but many arrive illegally from overseas through organised syndicates. Canberra set up a new border protection agency merging operations from the customs and immigration departments in 2014, partly to better screen what was coming in. Keenan said millions of dollars had since been spent since on better tools to detect illegal firearms in the mail or cargo, while a police anti-gang squad had seized 5,500 illicit guns or gun parts since being established in 2013."

Vietnamese hostage killed in Philippine clash	"July 16, 2017 MANILA (AFP) – A Vietnamese sailor being held hostage by extremist gunmen in southern Philippines was killed during a gun battle between the militants and troops, a military official said Thursday. Van Viet Tran was found dead yesterday following the clash with members of the feared Abu Sayyaf kidnapping group in the strife-torn Sulu island group, Brigadier General Cirilito Sobejana said. A soldier was also killed with 15 other troops wounded while the Abu Sayyaf suffered undetermined casualties, said Sobejana who heads a special anti-terror task force. “He (the Vietnamese) was hit by a bullet. Two things may have happened: he was hit during the encounter or he may have tried to take advantage of the situation (to escape) and then his abductors shot him,” he said. He said militants were holding Van and four other Vietnamese apparently kidnapped at sea in Sulu. Six other Vietnamese seamen were also being held on Basilan Island near Sulu, but two of them were beheaded last week. Abu Sayyaf militants have been seizing hostages for ransom for years, often targeting foreigners such as seamen passing through the waters of southern Philippines. The group, blamed for the worst terror attacks in the country’s history, is known to behead its hostages unless ransom payments are made. German Jurgen Kantner, 70, was beheaded in February after the kidnappers’ demand for 30 million pesos ($600,000) was not met. Last year, the Abu Sayyaf group also beheaded two Canadian hostages. Originally a loose network of militants formed in the 1990s with seed money from Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda network, the Abu Sayyaf group has splintered into factions with some continuing to engage in banditry and kidnapping. One faction led by Isnilon Hapilon has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, and its members are among the hundreds of militants who have been occupying parts of the southern city of Marawi for almost two months, despite a massive military operation to crush them."

Fil-Am in North Carolina gets life term for plotting mayhem with ISIS	"ASHEVILLE, North Carolina — A North Carolina man accused of plotting a U.S. terror attack that he discussed with a member of the Islamic State group received a life sentence on Tuesday, June 27. Justin Sullivan, 21, (a Filipino American) pleaded guilty in November. The Morganton man is also accused of killing his neighbor and stealing his money so he could buy an assault rifle to carry out an IS-inspired shooting at a concert or club. A doctor will observe Sullivan to determine if he’s predisposed to schizophrenia. The defense argued that being placed in a high-security prison could trigger schizophrenia. Prosecutors asked for a determination on the Clarke murder, but the judge only ruled on the acts of terror. The judge said he didn’t need to make a decision on the homicide case because that is the state’s responsibility. Prosecutors say Sullivan spoke with Junaid Hussain in June 2015 via social media about making a video of a terrorist attack in the U.S. to be used by the militant group. Hussain was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Syria in August 2015. Prosecutors said in a statement that Sullivan pleaded guilty to attempting to commit an act of terrorism – planning to kill hundreds of innocent people to prove his allegiance to the terrorist group ISIL. Prosecutors say Sullivan also admitted to regular contact with Junaid Hussain, one of ISIL’s prominent members in Syria, who asked Sullivan to make a video of the deadly attack. “It is frightening to know that the defendant in this case was able to use social media to contact and seek advice from ISIL, a murderous organization,” Rose said. Prosecutors said Sullivan watched violent ISIL attacks on the Internet, including beheadings, expressed support for the group and destroyed religious items that belonged to his parents. His father, retires US Marines Capt. Rich Sullivan, reported his son to the police. The young Sullivan also told an undercover FBI employee that he planned to buy a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle at a gun show and tried buying hollow point ammunition to use with the gun in June 2015."

"British police treating Manchester knife attack as terrorist investigation, Europe News & Top Stories"	"MANCHESTER • British police confirmed yesterday that they were treating a stabbing attack which injured three people at Manchester's Victoria train station as a terrorist investigation, and were searching an address in the Cheetham Hill area of the city. ""We are treating this as a terrorist investigation,"" Chief Constable Ian Hopkins told reporters. Monday's incident, classified as critical, is being investigated by the counter-terrorism police. Officials said that a man and a woman, both in their 50s, and a police officer were treated for knife injuries following the stabbings. Witness Sam Clack, 38, a BBC radio producer, yesterday said he heard the suspect shouting ""Allah"" before and during the attack. He quoted the suspect as saying: ""As long as you keep bombing other countries, this sort of s*** is going to keep happening."" The male suspect has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, said the police. The woman suffered injuries to her face and abdomen, and the man was wounded in the abdomen, while a British Transport Police officer sustained a stab wound to the shoulder. Their injuries were described as serious but not life threatening. The two members of the public were taken to hospital. The incident happened at around 8.50pm, when many revellers would have been out enjoying New Year's Eve celebrations across the city. Mr Clack said: ""I just heard this most blood-curdling scream and looked down the platform. ""He came towards me. I looked down and saw he had a kitchen knife with a black handle with a good 12-inch (30cm) blade. It was just fear, pure fear."" Mr Clack said police officers used a stun gun and pepper spray on the suspect who had been resisting arrest, before ""six or seven"" officers jumped on the man. An attack in May 2017 killed 22 people and wounded 139 at a concert in Manchester by US singer Ariana Grande."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Terrorist charges over death of Thai tourist	"PARIS: A man suspected of supplying the gun used in the Christmas market shooting attack that killed five people in Strasbourg has been handed preliminary terror charges, according to a French judicial official close to the investigation. The official, who could not be named with the case ongoing, said the individual appeared Monday before a judge and was charged with criminal association with terrorists, as well as possessing and supplying arms in connection with a terrorist enterprise. The man is suspected of furnishing the weapon that alleged gunman Cherif Chekatt used in the Dec 11 attack, the judicial official said. He was remanded into custody. Chekatt, 29, died in a shootout with police in Strasbourg last Thursday. Two other people were arrested and detained Monday as part of the terror investigation the Paris prosecutor's office is conducting into the attack. They also were suspected of ""playing a role in supplying the firearm,"" said the official. Their arrests bring the number of suspects in custody since the attack to three; Chekatt's parents and two of his brothers were questioned by police last week and released. The death toll from the attack increased to five Sunday night after a Polish man died of his wounds in a Strasbourg hospital. Barto Orent-Niedzielski, 36, lived in the city, where he worked at the European Parliament and as a journalist. The other casualties include an Italian journalist and Anupong, the tourist from Chachoengsao. According to reports, Orent-Niedzielski fought the shooter and stopped him from entering a crowded club, possibly preventing more deaths. Polish President Andrzej Duda wrote on Twitter that ""I knew him by sight. I am shocked. I had not realised that he was the one mortally wounded protecting other people. Honour to his memory. RIP."""

"PNP nabs couple supplying arms, ammo to terrorist groups"	"Assault firearms and thousands of ammunition rounds believed to be the property of the Philippine Army were seized by police authorities from a couple during an entrapment operation in Valenzuela City Monday. Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Director General Oscar Albayalde said the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) received a tip from a confidential informant that the couple, Edgardo Medel, 46, and his wife Rosemarie, 34, of Daisy Street, Land Ville Subdivision, BarangayPambuan, Gapan, Nueva Ecija, were supplying bulk of unlicensed firearms and ammunition for a hefty price to Maute terrorists, the Abu Sayyaf Group and rogue politicians. Elements of NCRPO-Regional Special Operations Unit (RSOU) and Regional Intelligence Division (RID) apprehended the suspects after buying two assault rifles, a handgun, and 12, 893 rounds of live ammunition worth P1.2 million. The transaction occurred around 6:30 p.m. Sunday at the service station along North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) while the couple were onboard an L300 van (REV 675). Albayalde said the three minor children of the couple who were inside the vehicle during the buy bust were turned over to social workers following the arrest of their parents. The firearms and ammunition presented by Albayalde in Camp Crame, Quezon City Monday afternoon were stored in two crates showing markings of the Philippine Army (PA). Albayalde revealed the couple were in contact with a retired AFP soldier, who may have been the source of the high-powered firearms and ammunition which they were selling to interest groups. The PNP chief withheld the identity of the retired soldier. “I just cannot imagine the death and destruction that will result should these war materials fall into the hands of the New People’s Army or the Abu Sayyaf Group,” Albayalde said. “Part of the continuing investigation will be to determine the source of these weapons and ammunition, and to possibly identify other persons involved,” he added. The suspects who are facing charges in relation to Republic Act 10591 were brought to the NCRPO headquarters."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Couple selling arms, ammos to terror groups nabbed"	" A couple allegedly supplying ammunitions and firearms to terrorist groups and private armed groups in Mindanao were arrested in Nueva Ecija on Sunday. The police said the war materiel worth millions of pesos seized from the couple’s possession may have come from a government arsenal. The cache of ammunitions consisting of 12,893 rounds for M-60 machine gun and armalite assault rifle and two high-powered firearms were intercepted by operatives of the National Capital Region Police Office from a Nueva Ecija based couple at 6 pm on Sunday. NCRPO director Guillermo Eleazar identified the alleged illegal arms dealer as Edgardo and Rosemarie Medel, residents of Landville Subdivision, Barangay Pambuan, Gapan, Nueva Ecija. The ammunitions were placed inside a wooden box with an Armed Forces of the Philippines markings. Investigators suspect that the war materiels came from a government arsenal. The seizure of cache of ammunitions, prompted Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana to order an investigation into the matter. “We’ll investigate how these ammo ended up in the wrong hands,” he said. The operation was made after NCRPO operatives acted on reports from their colleagues in Mindanao that arms supplies are being provided by the Medel couple who had also figured in previous arms transactions in Mindanao. Prior to the seizure, operatives conducted a test buy of ammunition from Medel, who told undercover security officials that they can supply as many as 10 rifles.The NCRPO operatives then initiated a buybust operations, sending undercover agents to purchase the weapons and ammunitions worth P1.2 million. At 6:30 pm, the couple arrived on aboard a white van bearing license plate REV 675 at the service station along NLEX where the transaction was made. The couple were immediately arrested after accepting the P1.2 million marked money from two undercover female operatives who posed as buyers of the weapons and ammunition purportedly to be used for the upcoming midterm elections in 2019. PNP Chief Oscar Abayalde said they have identified the couple’s sources, who, according to the suspects, was a retired military soldier from Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija. “We have names actually for verification allegedly meron siyang connection sa Fort Magsaysay,” Albayalde said. The PNP chief have yet to identify the source, but said that the alleged military officer could have been keeping the firearms and ammunitions for a time when he was still in active duty and decided to dispose of them only now. When asked if the ammunitions came from the Philippine Army, Albayalde said yes, but added that he will talk to Philippine Army authorities to determine the “lot numbers” of the firearms which could easily be traced to the unit that disposed them. “I just cannot imagine the death and destruction that will result should these war materials fall into the hands of the New People’s Army or the Abu Sayyaf Group,” Albayalde said."

Egyptian forces kill 40 suspected militants after tourist bus bombed	"CAIRO (REUTERS) - Egyptian security forces have killed 40 suspected militants in three separate incidents in North Sinai and Giza, the Interior Ministry said on Saturday, a day after a bombing on a Vietnamese tourist bus in Giza killed four people. The bombing, less than 4 km from the pyramids, on the outskirts of Cairo, is the first deadly attack against foreign tourists in Egypt for more than a year and comes as the tourism sector, a vital source of foreign currency, recovers from a sharp drop in visitor numbers since the country’s 2011 uprising. A spokesman for Britain’s Thomas Cook travel group said it had cancelled day trips to Cairo from the Red Sea resort of Hurghada following the attack and it would continue to review the security situation. The ministry did not say whether the suspected militants were connected to Friday’s attack, but said its forces killed 30 people during raids on their hideouts in Giza where it said “terrorist elements” were planning a series of attacks targeting state institutions and the tourism industry. Security forces also killed 10 suspected militants in North Sinai, where the country is fighting an insurgency led by Islamic State. State news agency MENA said that the suspects were killed in a gun battle. The ministry did not give any details about the suspects’ identity or whether there had been any casualties or injuries among the security forces. The statement said the three raids took place simultaneously. The ministry published photos of bloodied bodies with their faces concealed and assault rifles and shotguns lying on the floor beside them. Three Vietnamese tourists and an Egyptian guide were killed and at least 10 others injured when the roadside bomb hit their tour bus on Friday. Events such as the bombing of a Russian airliner shortly after it took off from Sharm el Sheikh in 2015, killing all 224 people on board, caused tourist numbers to Egypt to plunge. There are still no direct flights from major tourist markets such as Britain and Russia to the country’s biggest Red Sea resort, Sharm el Sheikh, since that attack. The government says fighting Islamist militants is a priority as it works to restore stability after the years of turmoil that followed the “Arab Spring” protests of 2011. Egypt’s military and police launched a major campaign against militant groups in February, targeting the Sinai Peninsula as well as southern areas and the border with Libya."	Terrorism	Terrorism
 Northern Ireland policeman injured in 'terrorist' attack	"BELFAST, Jan 23 — A police officer in Belfast was injured in a suspected drive-by shooting on yesterday in what Northern Ireland’s Police Federation said amounted to a “terrorist gun attack”. The incident happened at a petrol station in north Belfast at around 7.30pm, police said on Twitter. He was hit in the arm. There have been a number of bomb and gun attacks in recent years on police officers in Northern Ireland, which endured three decades of violence before a peace accord was signed in 1998. The Police Federation, which represents officers, said the incident amounted to a “terrorist gun attack”. Chairman Mark Lindsay condemned the shooting and warned officers to remain at high alert. “This attack on the life of an officer is a stark reminder of the determination on the part of terrorists to murder and maim police officers,” he said in a statement. Britain’s Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire said the incident was “sickening”. The attack comes as Northern Ireland prepares for snap elections on March 2 after the power-sharing executive collapsed earlier this month. — AFP"	Terrorism	Terrorism

 ‘Bato’ exhorts gun owners to help govt fight terrorists	"PHILIPPINE National Police chief Ronald dela Rosa said gun holders and owners can help the government fight terrorists, like the ones who overran Marawi City in May. “I wish all gun owners would unite so they can stop a repeat of the Marawi siege,” Dela Rosa said in Filipino during an arms show in Mandaluyong City. He said organized gun owners could deter terrorist groups. “I wish all the gun holders for example in the cities of Cotabato, Davao, Iligan, and Cagayan de Oro would organize themselves so that they can become a deterrent to a possible takeover like the Marawi siege,” he said. Dela Rosa said licensed and trained gun holders could shoot it out with terrorists before the military arrived. Dela Rosa said he already organized gun owners in Davao City so they could fight off terrorists. On Friday, military spokesman Maj. Gen. Restituto Padilla said government troops found more firearms and explosive devices in different parts of Marawi City. These included nine high-powered firearms and explosives buried in the shallow waters of Lake Lanao and at the village of Torongan, also in Lanao del Sur.Padilla said soldiers found two M16 machine guns, three rifles and two grenade launchers buried in Barangay Torongan. Two other high-powered firearms were found near the lake, Padilla added. The latest recover brought to 399 the number of firearms recovered by security forces who are conducting clearing operations in Marawi City. Troops also found 16 unused explosive devices, he said. In the main battle area and surrounding areas, troops were scouring for explosive devices and potential booby traps before residents would be allowed back into their homes. Padilla said 10 more villages would be cleared next week."	Terrorism	Terrorism

Man shot dead at Paris Orly airport after seizing soldier's gun	"PARIS • Security forces shot dead a man who seized a soldier's gun at Paris Orly airport in France yesterday, less than two hours after the same man shot and wounded a police officer during a routine check, the Interior Ministry said. The incident triggered a major security scare that shut down the airport and left thousands of travellers stranded. It took place at around 8.30am local time (3.30pm Singapore time) in the Orly-Sud terminal at the smaller of Paris' two international airports, located south of the capital. The man, identified as Ziyed Ben Belgacem in media reports, tried to snatch a gun from a female soldier ""in an extremely violent attack"" on her before he was shot dead, a French army spokesman said. Mr Benoit Brulon, a spokesman for France's anti-terror patrol force, said of the female soldier: ""She's doing fine."" Mr Brulon, speaking on BFMTV, said that the female soldier fell to the ground as she struggled with her attacker. ""It was then that her comrades opened fire to protect her and people around,"" he said. Separately, Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henri Brandet said it was ""possible"", but had yet to be established, that the incident could be called a terrorist attack. ""There's possibly a terrorist motive, but that's something the justice system will have to ascertain, and it will do so in due time,"" Mr Brandet told reporters. Interior Minister Bruno Le Roux said that the slain man had been linked to an earlier attack on police during a routine traffic inspection in the northern suburb of Garges-les-Gonesse at around 7am, in which an officer was slightly wounded in the head. He then continued south to steal another car in the suburb of Vitry-sur-Seine about 10km from Orly airport. In Vitry, he also ""burst into a bar and threatened those present"", Mr Le Roux said. The Journal du Dimanche said that the suspect, a 39-year-old French citizen, was known for robbery and drug trafficking. His home was searched in 2015, the paper reported. A police source described him as a radicalised Muslim. The anti-terrorism prosecutor has opened an investigation. BFMTV, without giving a source, said the attacker had texted his father, saying: ""I've screwed up. I've shot a policeman."" Police also searched his house in Garges-les-Gonesse, in the multiethnic Seine-Saint-Denis area. A witness to the events at the airport told BFMTV that he saw the man in possession of the soldier's rifle and threatening her. ""The soldiers were trying to reason with him,"" he said, adding that as he fled the scene he heard two shots. Mr Franck Lecam, a traveller bound for Tel Aviv, said that he heard ""three or four shots"" nearby as he was queuing to check in. ""There are policemen, emergency workers and soldiers everywhere,"" he said, after being forced to evacuate the terminal with around 3,000 others. Air traffic to Orly was suspended and all incoming flights rerouted to Charles de Gaulle airport, in the north of Paris. Several planes that were preparing for take-off or had just landed in Orly were grounded on the tarmac while the security operation unfolded. Passengers in the nearby Orly-Ouest terminal were confined in the building. Elite police teams intervened quickly to secure the airport and search it for possible explosives, but none were found. By early afternoon, Orly-Ouest had reopened and flights had started to resume. Orly-Sud had reopened to incoming flights, but outgoing flights were still suspended. The incidents come five weeks before France holds presidential elections, and on the second day of an official visit to Paris by Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Recent terror attacks in region linked to death of IS's Wanndy: DPM	"KUALA LUMPUR: Recent terror attacks in Mindanao, Bangkok and Jakarta are linked to the killing of Malaysian Islamic State (IS) terrorist Muhammad Wanndy Jedi, Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said today. He cautioned the public to be on the alert and keep a lookout for suspicious activities. The public, he said, should not take the incidents overseas lightly since they could easily occur in Malaysia if authorities are not cautious and if preventive measures are not in place. ""Malaysia's counterterrorism department is always on the watch (for suspicious activities). ""The recent bombing in Manchester could happen in this region. ""The police and counterterrorism department are on high alert following the attacks in Manchester and Jakarta. Plain-clothes officers are patrolling several hotspots,"" Zahid told a press conference after attending the Big Splash Open Data event here today. He noted that Malaysia's Intelligence Unit has identified Katibah Nusantara, a Malay archipelago unit linked to the IS, operating in this region. Zahid added that Malaysia is working closely with neighbouring countries in information-sharing and is cooperating with Interpol and Aseanapol to combat terrorism. Yesterday, two suspected suicide bombers killed three Indonesian police officers and injured 10 people in twin blasts near a bus station in Jakarta. On Monday, 22 people died and 59 others were badly wounded when Salman Abedi, a 22-year-old Briton of Libyan descent, detonated a homemade bomb at a crowded concert hall in Manchester. Hours earlier, a bomb explosion at the Royal Thai Army-affiliated Phramongkutklao Hospital, also known as the King Mongkut Hospital, injured 24 people. In addition, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte declared martial law on the country’s southern island of Mindanao after about 100 Muslim fighters laid siege to a major city following a deadly gun battle with government forces on Tuesday.

"Before Parliament violence, other attacks on Britain"	"Britain has been targeted anew by what authorities are calling a terrorist incident. A look at other attacks on the country in recent years: An attacker stabbed a police officer at Britain's Parliament before being shot by police, while a vehicle ran over pedestrians on nearby Westminster Bridge at around the same time. One woman was killed, others injured. An Islamic State-inspired taxi driver tried to behead a passenger in the east London Underground station of Leytonstone. Somali-born Muhiddin Mire was sent to a high-security mental hospital to serve a life sentence. The judge ruled that Mire had been motivated by events in Syria. The incident came days after Parliament approved British airstrikes on Islamic State group targets in Syria. Two British-born, al-Qaida-inspired extremists stabbed off-duty soldier Lee Rigby to death on a busy south London street. The men ran Rigby down with their vehicle and then used a cleaver to hack him to death. Images of attacker Michael Adebolajo holding a butcher knife and cleaver with bloodied hands in the moments after killing shocked people around the world and sparked fears of Islamist extremism in Britain. Adebolajo and his accomplice were sentenced to life in prison. Two men were arrested after they drove a Jeep Cherokee into Glasgow Airport's terminal in Scotland and set it ablaze. Authorities said the attack was linked to a failed car bombing a day before in London's West End, where an ambulance crew outside a nightclub spotted smoke coming from a Mercedes that turned out to be rigged with explosives. A second Mercedes also filled with explosives was found hours later in an impound lot. In the worst peacetime attack on Britain this century, four Al-Qaida-inspired bombers blew themselves up on three subway trains and a bus in London, killing 52. Three of the bombers were British-born, all of Pakistani descent; the other emigrated from Jamaica. (**)"	Terrorism	Terrorism
Arrested Terror Suspects Closely Linked to Islamic State: Nat'l Police	"Jakarta. Eight terror suspects arrested in a series of raids on the outskirts of Jakarta this week are Islamic State supporters who were allegedly involved in attacks and the smuggling of firearms, police said on Friday (24/03). One alleged terrorist was shot dead after resisting arrest during an operation in Cilegon, Banten, on Thursday. Three others were arrested and a pistol was confiscated. Police identified the deceased as Nanang Kosim, whom they said attended meetings by Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) in Batu, Malang, East Java, in late November. The JAD unites small Islamic State-supporting terrorist cells in Indonesia. The group is led by Aman Abdurrahman, a cleric currently imprisoned on Nusakambangan Island at Cilacap, Central Java. Police have named Aman as one of the masterminds behind the terrorist attack in Jalan Thamrin, Central Jakarta, in January last year, which resulted in the death of four people, including the attackers. Investigations showed that Nanang had assisted a militant identified as Abu Asybal in his bid to evade police raids following the attack. Police said along with the three militants who were arrested this week, Nanang also planned to train militants in Halmahera, North Maluku. He allegedly also supplied the JAD with M16 assault rifles. Officers identified those arrested as Ahmad Supriyanto, Icuk Pamulang and Abdul Majid – who was shot in the arm during Thursday's raid. Hours before moving against the four terror suspects, the National Police's anti-terrorism squad, Densus 88, arrested four others in Pandeglang and South Tangerang in Banten and Bekasi in West Java. Police identified the suspect arrested in Bekasi only by the initials S.M., whom they said funded the Thamrin attack. He also had links to terrorist networks in the southern Philippines, who supplied him with the firearms that were used in the Thamrin attack, police said. ""There were two firearms used in the Thamrin bomb attack. It turns out that they were bought from the Philippines,"" National Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Martinus Sitompul said at his office in Jakarta. Indonesia has seen a series or Islamic State-linked attacks since the one in Jakarta, but police have also managed to thwart several other plots, and arrested dozens of suspects across the country."

PNP defends ML implementation in Mindanao amid Cotabato bomb attack	" Security forces could not guard every inch of Mindanao from terrorist groups, a police official said yesterday following a bomb attack in Cotabato City on Tuesday despite the martial law implementation in the southern part of the country for more than a year now. Chief Supt. Benigno Durana, Jr., spokesman of the Philippine National Police (PNP), also defended the martial law implementation, saying there could have been more attacks if it is not existing in the entire Mindanao. “There could have been more attacks from local terror groups if martial law was not imposed in Mindanao,” said Durana. The entire Mindanao has been under martial law since the Marawi City siege in May 2017. Recently, Congress has approved the extension of martial law for one year, or until December 31, 2019, citing the continuing rebellion in Mindanao. Critics and members of the opposition have been rejecting the extension of martial law, Mindanao security could still be ensured like in the past even without it. Netizens have also been raising questions as to why the bombing in front of a mall in Cotabato City that left two dead and more than 30 injured still happened when Mindanao was supposed to be under tight watch due to martial law. But Durana said more than the presence of soldiers, public cooperation and vigilance are still essential to thwart any terror attack, especially form ISIS-inspired local groups. “The security forces cannot guard every inch of Mindanao. That’s why the people’s cooperation and vigilance not just security sector’s vigilance is equally if not much more important in keeping our communities safe and secure,” said Durana. He stressed that the same terror problems are still being experienced by much-more developed countries. “But one way or the other one or two incidents may fall on some cracks. This is true not only in the Philippines but also in much more developed countries like in Europe that are likewise facing the same global problem of terrorism,” said Durana. He however said that the security situation on Mindanao has been improved because of the martial law. The same reason was also raised by proponents of martial law when they sought for martial law extension. Security officials would also argue that Mindanao people have been supportive of the martial law. “Safety and security wise, the people of Mindanao are in a much better shape now due to the signed peace agreements with MNLF (Moro National Liberation Front) and recently the MILF that brought, despite some challenges, a much more stable peace and security and much more positive economic outlook in Mindanao than at any other times in its history,” said Durana."

Blast triggers travel warning	"Australia and the United Kingdom have cautioned their citizens against traveling to Mindanao in the wake of recent“Terrorists are very likely to try to carry out attacks in the Philippines, including in Manila,” an advisory from the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office said. “Terrorist groups continue to  plan attacks and have the capacity and the intent to carry out attacks at any time and anywhere in the country, including in places visited by foreigners, like airports, shopping malls, public transport, including the metro system, and places of worship.” The advisory citedthat killed two people and wounded 34 others. Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade cautioned its citizens against travel to central and western Mindanao, including Sulu and the Zamboanga Peninsula. The military said Wednesday. Although the latest advisory focused on Mindanao, the FCO also advised against non-essential travel to points south of Cebu due to threat of terrorism.“Terrorist groups continue to plan kidnap operations against western nationals in the Philippines. This threat extends throughout the Philippines, both on land and at sea, but is particularly acute in the southern Philippines [Mindanao, Palawan and central Visayas, including Siquijor and Dumaguete],” the UK advisory said. The United Kingdom also cited the report of American authorities that highlighted “poor aviation security” at the capital’s main airport. “Additional security measures are in place on flights departing from this airport to the UK. You should cooperate fully with security officials. The UK keeps aviation security measures under constant review, in conjunction with international partners and the aviation industry,” the advisory said. The United Kingdom said that some 154,000 British nationals visited the Philippines in 2015. “Most visits are trouble-free,” it said. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana played down the British advisory, saying it was nothing unusual. “The British advisory is an automatic and default warning of governments to their nationals like we also do when these things happen in other countries,” Lorenzana said. Meanwhile, the US Embassy in Manila condemned the recent bombing in Cotabato. “We offer condolences to the loved ones of the victims and hope for a quick recovery for the injured,” it said in a statement. A ranking military official said Wednesday intense disagreements over the BOL could be behind the Cotabato blast, but said they have not ruled out possible extortion by communist rebels.Close to 2.8 million voters are expected to cast their votes during the BOL plebiscite on Jan. 21, 2019 in the areas of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, Isabela City in Basilan and Cotabato City. Separate voting will be held on Feb. 6, 2019, for those residing in Lanao del Norte, except Iligan City and six North Cotabato municipalities. Armed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff Lt. Gen. Benjamin Madrigal assured the public that security forces are doing everything they can to prevent a repeat of the blast in Cotabato City. Police have formed a special task group to speed up the investigation of the mall bombing. Chief Supt. Eliseo Tam Rasco, police director for Region 12, said the task group in coordination with the military and other security agencies, is looking at all possible angles and motives behind the Dec. 31 bombing in front of South Seas Mall. “I admit the suspects slipped past our tight security,” Rasco told reporters here Tuesday. The special task group South Seas is headed by Senior Supt. Oliver Enmodias, PRO-12 deputy regional director for operations. Rasco said while the task group is looking at possible retaliatory attacks by Islamic State-linked group, it is also looking at possible “destabilization” by a third group opposed to the holding of a plebiscite for the Bangsamoro Organic Law later this month.  In a statement, Presidential Peace Adviser Carlito Galvez Jr. strongly condemned the bomb attack, describing it as a treacherous and a cowardly attack against humanity and the people of Cotabato City.  “In these trying times when our resolve to pursue just and enduring peace is being tested, I encourage everyone to practice sobriety and not be swayed to spread unfounded speculations relating to the incident,” Galvez said as he extended condolences to the families of the recent attack. He described the incident as an “isolated case” and said security forces are on top of the situation. “Let us not allow this incident to discourage us to unite and act as one in our collective aspiration to achieve just and enduring peace not just in Mindanao, but in the whole country,” he said."

" Yellow Vest protesters mull over protest on Saturday after terror attack in France, Europe News & Top Stories"	"PARIS (BLOOMBERG) - Members of the grassroots Yellow Vests movement plan to protest in Paris and elsewhere in France on Saturday (Dec 15), even as security concerns mount following a terror attack in Strasbourg. The government hasn't decided whether to ban the protests, spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said on Thursday in an interview on C-News television. Griveaux added that security forces will be deployed regardless, since more radical elements of the movement ""may take to the streets, pillage and destroy property"". The Paris police will unveil plans by the end of Friday, a spokesman said in an e-mail. People across France have been pulling yellow vests from the trunks of their cars for more than a month to express a whole series of grievances. What began as traffic blockades has peaked in serious violence in Paris for the past two weekends. Yet the only thing the protesters really have in common is their contempt for President Emmanuel Macron. That lack of a single policy goal means that at least some protests are nearly certain to continue. Police and military forces, who've also been deployed to address tensions in some high schools and universities, now have to add terrorism into the equation. French authorities have increased the national terror alert to its highest level after a man shot people in the streets of Strasbourg on Tuesday, killing three and wounding a dozen. The suspected gunman was shot dead on Thursday in a brief gunbattle with police after being on the run for 48 hours, reports said. ""Law enforcement could be significantly distracted because of the recent terrorist attack,"" Ryan DeStefano, vice-president of security for travel risk management provider On Call International, said in an e-mailed note. ""In addition, protests provide an opportune time for radicals to engage in terrorist activities under the guise of peaceful protest."" At least one union head, Laurent Berger of the CFDT union, called for a halt to the Yellow Vest demonstrations. While some members of the Yellow Vests, named after the safety jacket required to be carried in each car, have decided to halt their protests, others remain unconvinced. In a press conference on Thursday, demonstrators from Montceau-les-Mines in eastern France said they would wouldn't stop. They found some support from both ends of France's political spectrum. Jean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the leftist France Unbowed party, said he was ""surprised"" the terror attack could be used to pressure those who want to demonstrate. Yellow Vests are ""not responsible for the terrorist risk"", Marine Le Pen, leader of the National Rally party, formerly known as the National Front, said, without making a specific reference to what followers of her movement should do on Saturday."

 US man allegedly planned IS-inspired attack Ohio synagogue	"US authorities on Monday charged an Ohio man with providing material support to the Islamic State for an alleged plan to carry out a mass shooting attack at a synagogue. Damon Joseph, 21, allegedly had made a detailed plan to kill worshippers at a synagogue in the city of Toledo during the Jewish Sabbath, which begins at sunset Friday and lasts until nightfall Saturday. He was arrested Friday when he picked up two semi-automatic assault rifles from a federal undercover agent. Police said the rifles had been rendered inoperable. An affidavit filed in federal court claimed Joseph was inspired by Islamic State online propaganda and the October shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue -- the worst anti-Semitic attack in modern US history in which 11 were killed. ""I admire what the guy did with the (Pittsburgh) shooting actually,"" Joseph wrote to an undercover agent, according to the affidavit. ""I can see myself carrying out this type of operation inshallah,"" he was quoted as saying, using a common Arabic-language expression which roughly translates to ""God willing."" A day before his arrest, authorities said Joseph provided a plan for his attack -- including the address of the synagogue and research to identify when more worshippers would be present. An undercover agent met Joseph at a predetermined location Friday and he took a duffel bag containing two AR-15-type rifles, according to the affidavit. He then was arrested. ""This man spent months planning a violent terrorist attack on behalf of ISIS here in the United States,"" US Attorney Justin Herdman said in a statement. ""The charges describe a calculated man fueled by an ideology of hatred and intent on killing innocent people."" Joseph came to the attention of the FBI in May, when he began distributing messages of support for the Islamic State on social media, authorities said. An undercover agent began communicating with Joseph. Over the subsequent months, he expressed an interest in supporting Islamic State propaganda operations and, eventually, to carrying out an attack. If convicted, Joseph could face up to 20 years in prison."	Terrorism	Terrorism

9 hurt as car crashes into New Year's crowd in Tokyo	"TOKYO: A car ploughed into crowds celebrating New Year's Day early on Tuesday in a suspected terror attack, leaving nine people injured, including one who was unconscious. Police arrested Kazuhiro Kusakabe, 21, who was driving the rental car with an Osaka license plate, on suspicion of attempted murder. Investigative sources quoted the man as saying he had perpetrated an act of terrorism ""in retaliation for an execution"" and ""would not make any excuse"" for his act. It was not immediately clear whether he was referring to a specific execution or Japan's system of capital punishment. Kusakabe told the police he had driven from Osaka and intended to kill the pedestrians he hit. There was a tank of kerosene in the rental car, which he said he planned to use to burn the vehicle, the investigative sources said. Eight people were hit by the car, including a teenage boy who is in critical condition, the police said. Another man was slightly injured after Kusakabe allegedly struck him after getting out of the car, the police said. Kusakabe fled the scene, but the police found him in a nearby park about half an hour later. The incident happened shortly after midnight local time on Monday in a popular tourist area of Harajuku, near Meiji Shrine, in central Tokyo.

MILF denounces Cotabato mall blast; military sees terror hand	"Cotabato City—The Moro Islamic Liberation Front has added its voice to those condemning the bomb attack that killed two persons and wounded 31 others along a busy thoroughfare outside a mall on Monday. At the same time, the Bangsamoro Transition Commission under MILF first vice chairman Ghazzali Jaafar urged the Office of the President to direct national law enforcement agencies to help determine the real perpetrators of the bomb attack and bring them to justice. In an official statement sent to news organizations, MILF Chairman Hadji Murad Ibrahim said the MILF “condemns in the highest possible terms” Monday’s bomb attack. “The dastardly act of [placing] an improvised explosive device [IED] with intent to kill or harm civilians is an act of cowardice, inhuman, and atrocious,” Murad said. Murad called on “concerned authorities to sincerely and thoroughly investigate this evil act”—saying that ascribing any motive would be too premature at this time. “We ask the authorities to examine all angles and make the result of the same public. We should not allow any party or group to make premature conclusions or draw insinuations so as to advance their own personal interest and political agenda,” he said. He said the MILF sympathizes with the victims, and that the families of the fatalities and the wounded deserved true justice. He said it is for the reason of securing the community that the MILF and the government, together with all their partners in the peace process, have pushed hard for the passage of Bangsamoro Organic Law” to establish a “government that can really protect and promote the peace and security of the place and its peoples.” In a BTC statement, Jaafar said it was unfortunate that one of the fatalities was an employee--Jonathan Torribiano, who was a driver for BTC Commissioner Melanio Ulama. Lawyer Naguib Sinarimbo, secretary-general of the MILF’s United Bangsamoro Justice Party, said while residents should be thankful for a prompt defusing of “explosives found in the baggage counter of the mall,” reports falsely identified Nur Misuari, founding chairman of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) as the owner of the South Seas Mall. Sinarimbo said residents knew that the mall is not owned by Misuari but by the Lim family, who have been engaged in legitimate businesses after settling in Tawi-Tawi in the early 1960s when Misuari was still virtually unknown. Military officials said they believed the Islamic State-linked Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters had a hand in the bombing. Among those injured in Monday’s bombing, which came at about 2 p.m., were 10 minors, according to Maj. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, the commander of the Army’s 6th Infantry Division (ID). He said an initial investigation led to the BIFF, which has shifted to attacking non-combatants, starting with the twin bombings in Isulan in September 2018. “We are not discounting the possibility that the Daesh-inspired group was responsible in the bombing,” Sobejana said. Senior Supt. Rolly Octavio, city police director, said police are reviewing the closed circuit TV (CCTV) camera footage taken at South Seas Mall to help identify the perpetrators. “Our authorities have the information about the suspects, as to the motive, that is being determined,” Cotabato City Mayor Cynthia Guiani-Sayadi said in a news conference some two hours after the blast. Octavio said bomb experts recovered about one kilo of cut nails, a plastic container with traces of black powder and broken parts of a mobile phone at the blast site.In a follow-up operation inside the mall, police found another bomb in the second-floor baggage counter left by a still unidentified man. “A CCTV captured the man’s facial features,” Octavio said. Gov. Mujiv Hataman of the 00Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao also condemned the attack, calling those behind it “evil.” “We are irrevocably grieved about the casualties incurred, thoroughly condemn this act, and call for a thorough investigation. We need to make sure acts like these never happen again, and that the perpetrator is brought to justice,” Hataman said in a statement released Monday. Cotabato City, though not part of ARMM, hosts the administrative center of the region through its Shariff Kabunsuan Complex here. Hataman urged investigators to look deeply into the case and ensure that civilians do not get caught up in terror. “We cannot afford to be divisive at this moment. Only by melding together can we bring about peace and justice,” he said. He urged civil leaders and security officials to remain united. “What we need is to be composed, to redouble our efforts, and to hold on to our dream of peace in the region. We cannot be divided on this front,” Hataman added. The Japanese government and the European Union on Tuesday stood in solidarity with the Philippines following the mall bombing. As a country “strongly condemning violent extremism,” Japan stands in solidarity with the government and the people of the Philippines, Japanese Ambassador Koji Haneda said in a statement. EU Ambassador Franz Jessen, meanwhile, said his thoughts and prayers go to the victims as he reiterated the bloc’s support to the ongoing peace process in Mindanao. “The EU fully supports the ongoing peace process in Mindanao. I frequently visit Cotabato and am impressed each time by the progress made, and the commitment of my counterparts to build a better future for the region. Peace and reconciliation is the way forward. Violence and hatred will never succeed,” he said in a separate statement. “The New Year brings new hope to us all, and we stand together with the Philippine government in its efforts to make the country more peaceful and safer,” he added."

French extremist in court for Brussels Jewish museum attack trial	"BRUSSELS (AFP) – A French extremist appeared in court yesterday ahead of his trial for shooting dead four people at a Jewish museum in Brussels in 2014 following his return from Syria. Mehdi Nemmouche, accused of being the first battle-hardened extremist to stage a terror attack on European soil, faces a life sentence if convicted over the killing spree in the Belgian capital on May 24, 2014. Both Nemmouche, 33, and Nacer Bendrer, a fellow Frenchman aged 30 who allegedly supplied the weapons, deny charges of ‘terrorist murder’. Nemmouche, wearing a blue sweater, spoke only to confirm his identity as the hearing began at 10.30am. “Nemmouche, Mehdi, 33 years old, unemployed,” he told the criminal court in Brussels, which spent the day yesterday selecting the 12-member jury ahead of the start of the full trial on Thursday. More than 100 witnesses are due to testify at the trial, which will be attended by the victims’ families and Jewish community leaders, who have denounced the anti-Semitic nature of the attack. And more than 300 Belgian and foreign journalists have registered to cover the proceedings which could last until the end of February. The deadly attack, which lasted only 82 seconds, shocked Belgium and the world. Firing a pistol and then an assault rifle, the gunman killed two Israeli tourists, a French volunteer and a Belgian receptionist at the Jewish Museum. Nemmouche – born to a family of Algerian origin in the northern French town of Roubaix – was arrested six days after the attack. He was caught in the southern French port city of Marseille after arriving on a bus from Brussels, carrying a handgun and an assault rifle."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Three killed, 13 injured in Strasbourg attack"	"Police motorcycles drives in the streets of Strasbourg, eastern France, after a shooting breakout, on Tuesday. FREDERICK FLORIN/AFP Three people were killed and 13 wounded, eight seriously, when a gunman opened fire at a famed Christmas market in the eastern French city of Strasbourg, officials said on Wednesday. “The attacker, who was on the S list [of extremists watched by police], is actively being hunted by security forces,” local officials said in a statement. Some 350 people, including police, troops and helicopters, were on the heels of the attacker who had “sowed terror” in the city, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said. The killer opened fire at around 1900 GMT (2am in Cambodia) on one of the city’s busiest streets, sending crowds of evening shoppers fleeing for safety. Soldiers patrolling the area as part of regular anti-terror operations exchanged fire with the suspect and wounded him, but could not stop him escaping, police sources said. A soldier was slightly injured by a ricohet from a shot by the gunman. Castaner also said France had raised its security alert level to “emergency attack” with “the implementation of reinforced border controls and tightened controls on all Christmas markets in France to avoid the risk of a copycat” attack. The gunman has been identified and was on a watchlist of suspected extremists, a statement from local security services said. France’s security forces, already on high alert after a series of terror attacks since 2015, are particularly stretched at the moment due to anti-government protests that have swept the country. “I heard shooting and then there was pandemonium,” said one witness, who gave his name as Fatih. “People were running everywhere.” He said he had seen three people injured on the ground only a few metres from the giant Christmas tree in the centre of the city. Shortly after the shooting, lines of police vehicles and ambulances streamed into the market area, under festive lights declaring the city the “capital of Christmas”. “We heard several shots, three perhaps, and we saw people running,” one witness said anonymously. “One of them fell down, I don’t know whether it was because she was tripped up or if she was hit,” the witness said. President Emmanuel Macron expressed on Twitter the solidarity of the whole nation after holding a crisis meeting with cabinet officials in Paris. Two separate security sources said on condition of anonymity that the shooter was believed to be a 29-year-old from the city, whose name was given as Cherif, and who was set to be arrested on Tuesday morning. He was being investigated over an attempted murder, one of the sources said. Several areas neighbouring the Christmas market were sealed off on Tuesday night and residents were being told to stay indoors. Many people took refuge in local restaurants and bars which pulled down their shutters. “We let everyone inside, down into the wine cellar. They’re locked in there,” said local restaurant owner Mouad, 33. A police source, again speaking on condition of anonymity, said security forces had opened fire in an area of the city where the suspect was thought to be hiding. The source did not give the address and it was unclear if the shooter had been located. Specialist anti-terror prosecutors have opened an investigation into the incident in Strasbourg, which lies on the border with Germany. Several residents of the city have been detained in recent years for trying to reach jihadist groups in Syria, or have been arrested upon their return. “Shocked and saddened by the terrible attack in Strasbourg. My thoughts are with all of those affected and with the French people,” British Prime Minister Theresa May wrote on Twitter. The Strasbourg-based European Parliament was also on lockdown, with MEPs, staff and journalists unable to leave the building. In a parliament bar usually reserved for MEPs, EU commissioners, powerful legislators and staffers huddled in small groups waiting for developments. “Our first thought was for colleagues who had already made it to the centre of town, who are safe,” Belgian MEP Kathleen Van Brempt said. Security has been stepped up in recent years after a series of attacks in France by Islamist gunmen and the Strasbourg market was long considered a possible target. Three years after groups of jihadists gunned down and blew up 130 people in Paris on November 13, 2015, French counter-terror officials say their focus has shifted. Rather than coordinated attacks, their main concern is attacks by “lone wolves” – self-radicalised individuals acting without links to terror groups such as Islamic State. A total of 246 people have been killed in terror attacks in France since 2015, according to an AFP toll."	Terrorism	Terrorism

Suicide bomber hits Kurdish-run base in Syria - IS	"AMMAN: Islamic State said one of its suicide bombers killed some people on Monday at a military base in Syria’s Raqqa city, which is under control of a U.S.- backed and Kurdish-led militia. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), led by Kurds, said a militant blew himself up in a blast that killed one civilian and injured several of its fighters. Though the SDF did not say where the blast took place, two Raqqa residents reached by Reuters said they heard an explosion in a central district of the city housing military offices. The ultra hardline jihadist Islamic State’s (IS) claim of responsibility came in a statement by the affiliated Amaq news agency. It said the attack targeted a recruitment centre in Raqqa and that 17 people were killed or wounded. Amaq said the bomber, whom it named as Abu Abdullah al Shami, had first used his machine gun then detonated a vest. The SDF also said earlier it had clashed with IS fighters who infiltrated through an old tunnel in the city near an outpost where their fighters were stationed. The Kurdish-led alliance seized the city in Syria’s northeast from Islamic State with the help of U.S.-led air strikes in 2017. Raqqa, which IS declared the capital of its self-proclaimed caliphate, was taken by the SDF six years into Syria’s civil war after a protracted battle that killed thousands of civilians and wrecked much of the city. Rebuilding and restoring Raqqa, which was once home to more than 300,000 people, is proving a monumental task. Since losing almost all the large swathes of territory it took in lightning offensives in Syria and Iraq in 2014-15, IS has returned to deadly hit-and-run attacks and ambushes. Some people in Raqqa resent effective Kurdish control over the predominately Arab city, with many objecting to compulsory enlistment to its forces, heavy taxes on civilians and a tight security grip where dissent is not tolerated. --Reuters"	Terrorism	Terrorism
No Filipino casualties in attacks in Brazil and France	"MANILA, Philippines — No Filipinos were reported to be among the casualties in the shooting incidents in Brazil and France, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said. In a statement on Wednesday, the DFA said that Ambassador to Brazil Marichu Mauro and Ambassador to France Ma. Theresa Lazaro informed the DFA home office “that so far there have been no reports of any Filipinos among the dead and injured in the two incidents.” According to Mauro, four people were killed when a gunman on Tuesday opened fire at the end of the midday services at the Metropolitan Cathedral in the city of Campinas, 100 kilometers north of Sao Paolo. Mauro said the motive behind the shooting was still under investigation as the suspect, who killed himself after the incident, reportedly had no criminal record. Meanwhile, Lazaro said that three people were killed while 12 others were left wounded after a gunman opened fire near a popular Christmas market in Strasbourg, 490 kilometers east of Paris Tuesday evening. Lazaro added that “the French government had categorized the incident as a terror attack and had raised the risk level to the highest category.” /atm"	Terrorism	Terrorism
Man acquitted of terror charge over Buckingham Palace sword attack	"LONDON, Dec 20 — An Uber driver was found not guilty yesterday of a terror charge after he injured police officers arresting him outside Queen Elizabeth II's Buckingham Palace residence while he was armed with a Samurai sword. Mohiussunnath Chowdhury, 27, was unanimously acquitted by jurors at England's Old Bailey central criminal court in London of one charge of preparing acts of terrorism, following a retrial. Two unarmed officers had suffered cuts to their hands when they tried to disarm him near the monarch's famous London residence in August 2017. They feared for their lives during the confrontation as Chowdhury repeatedly shouted “Allahu Akbar.” The court also heard he supported terrorism by the Islamic State group, and had sent a suicide note to his sister “expressing hate of the queen and her soldiers.” But during his trial Chowdhury, from the town of Luton, north of London, told jurors he only wanted to be killed by police and had no intention to hurt anyone himself. After the not guilty verdict was read out, he saluted the jurors who had spent 11 hours and 36 minutes considering his fate. A spokesman for England's Crown Prosecution Service said Chowdhury had been charged with “the most appropriate offence” and would face no further prosecution over the incident. — AFP"	Terrorism	Terrorism
UK counter-terror police probe Manchester knife attack	"MANCHESTER: British counter-terrorism police were investigating a multiple stabbing in which the suspect reportedly shouted ""Allah"" at a Manchester railway station on New Year's Eve, officials said Tuesday. A man and a woman, both in their 50s, and a police officer were being treated for knife injuries following the stabbings on Monday evening at Manchester Victoria station in the northwestern English city. Witness Sam Clack, 38, a BBC radio producer, said he heard the suspect shouting ""Allah"" before and during the attack. He quoted the suspect as saying: ""As long as you keep bombing other countries, this sort of shit is going to keep happening."" The male suspect has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said in a statement. The woman suffered injuries to her face and abdomen and the man was wounded in the abdomen, while a British Transport Police officer sustained a stab wound to the shoulder. Their injuries were described as serious but not life-threatening. The two members of the public were taken to hospital. The incident happened at around 8.50pm (3.50am on Tuesday in Thailand), when many revellers in the city would have been enjoying New Year's Eve celebrations. 'Blood-curdling scream' Clack said: ""I just heard this most blood-curdling scream and looked down the platform. ""He came towards me. I looked down and saw he had a kitchen knife with a black handle with a good 12 inch (30-centimetre) blade. ""It was just fear, pure fear."" Clack said police officers used a stun gun and pepper spray before, ""six or seven"" officers jumped on the man. Clack said he heard the alleged knifeman shouting ""Allah"" during the attack. He added: ""He shouted it before, he shouted it during it -- 'Allah'."" A witness who gave her name as Rebekka told the Daily Mirror newspaper: ""I heard the most blood-curdling scream I've ever heard and turned to see everyone running towards me. ""I jumped off the tram track and started to run down the tram lines and hid behind some concrete slabs under one of the arches. ""I was just really scared, I didn't know if I was going to die."" Police 'open mind' Police declared the attack a ""critical incident"". GMP Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts said the investigation was being led by counter-terrorism police and officers were keeping an ""open mind"". ""Tonight's events will have understandably worried people but I need to stress that the incident is not ongoing, a man is in custody and there is currently no intelligence to suggest that there is any wider threat at this time,"" he said. ""While we don't yet know the full circumstances and are keeping an open mind, officers from Counter Terror Policing North West are leading the investigation. ""This is to ensure we have all the expertise available to us and progress our investigation as soon as we possibly can."" The city's New Year celebrations went ahead in Albert Square despite the incident, with a firework display taking place as planned, though increased security was brought in. The city experienced a suicide attack in May 2017, when 22 people were killed and 139 wounded at a concert by the US singer Ariana Grande at the Manchester Arena. The bomber, Salman Abedi, 22, was born and raised in Manchester."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Indonesia uses tougher anti-terror law to detain suspects for holidays	"JAKARTA, Dec 20 — Indonesian police have detained about 20 suspected militants as security is stepped up ahead of the Christmas and New Year’s holiday season, a commander said today. National police chief Tito Karnavian said the detentions were made preventively under a revised anti-terrorism law approved in May, after suicide bombings claimed by Islamic State killed more than 30 people in the city of Surabaya. “There is no information yet about terror acts over Christmas and New Year’s but we are taking proactive steps including these arrests,” Karnavian told reporters. Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority country, has struggled to contain a resurgence in militancy and scores of Indonesians have travelled to the Middle East to join the Islamic State group. Near-simultaneous attacks on churches in the capital, Jakarta, and elsewhere on Christmas Eve in 2000, killed nearly 20 people. Ever since, authorities have stepped up security at churches and tourist spots for the holiday. Karnavian did not identify any of the suspects but said they were detained in various parts of the country. Under the revised law, anyone suspected of planning an attack can be held for up to 21 days for an initial inquiry and for up to 200 days for a formal investigation. — Reuters"	Terrorism	Terrorism
India busts ISIS-inspired militant group	" NEW DELHI (AFP) - India's anti-terror agency on Wednesday (Dec 26) said it had busted a local militant cell inspired by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group that was planning to carry out bombings and target prominent political figures. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) said 10 members of an obscure militant group ""Harkat ul Harb-e-Islam"" were arrested in multi-city raids and a further six suspects were being questioned over their alleged links with the outfit. NIA spokesman Alok Mittal said arms and ammunition were recovered from the raids over 17 locations, including in the capital New Delhi, as the group prepped for striking several targets ahead of the high-profile Republic Day national event on Jan 26. ""They were at an advanced stage of carrying out a series of blasts,"" Mr Mittal told reporters at a press conference in New Delhi. ""They wanted to explode remote-controlled bombs and even conduct fidayeen (suicide) attacks."" Mr Mittal said the group had attempted to make suicide vests and developed a homemade rocket launcher, adding that the unknown mastermind of the module was based abroad. One of the accused is an engineer, he said. The authorities have previously claimed to have foiled similar ISIS-inspired cells but there is no evidence of the militant group's presence in the country. Indian Muslims have largely remained insulated from ISIS influence, with only a handful of young men from the country's nearly 175 million minority community joining the militant group that gained worldwide prominence after capturing large swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria in 2014. But India's security agencies have voiced concern over the radicalisation of men over the Internet. In 2014, a group of four Mumbai engineering students travelled to Iraq to join the group. One of them later returned to India. But some activists have accused security agencies of falsely charging Muslim men for terrorism, due to discrimination against the community in the Hindu-majority country of 1.25 billion people."

Look back 2018: Year of hope and despair for South-east Asia	"On Sunday, May 13, Dita Oeprianto, his wife Puji, and their two sons and two daughters, attacked three churches in Indonesia's second biggest city, Surabaya. Eighteen people were killed, including the family of six. The father attacked one church, the mother and two daughters, aged nine and 12, targeted another, and the two sons, who were 16 and 18, bombed a third church. The attacks were the first time children were involved in a suicide bombing in Indonesia, and also the first successful local suicide bombing involving a woman. The next day, another family of a couple and their daughter and two sons carried out a suicide bombing at Surabaya's police headquarters. Ten people were wounded while all the attackers were killed, except for the daughter, Aisyah, eight. The fathers from the two families were involved with Indonesia's terror network Jemaah Ansharut Daulah, which is affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria terror group. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte ordered the shutdown of the Philippines' famous holiday island of Boracay in April for six months, saying it had become a cesspool, tainted by sewage dumped directly into the sea by hotels, restaurants and businesses. The island brought in tourism revenue of some 56 billion pesos (S$1.46 billion) last year. The holiday island was reopened in October with promises of cleaner waters and beaches. The biggest scandal in the region is over state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a name now synonymous around the world with high-level corruption and embezzlement. With the shock fall of the Barisan Nasional government, the wrongdoing has been actively pursued by the new Mahathir administration, snagging former premier Najib Razak. Lorryloads of cash, luxury bags and jewellery were hauled from apartments linked to him, in probes into whether these were linked to the scandal. The Malaysian government also seized the 91.5m-long yacht Equaminity, bought by its owners for US$250 million (S$343 million), with help from Indonesia, and moved it to Port Klang, where it was later put up for auction. Najib currently faces 32 charges in Malaysia's court, including those linked to missing 1MDB funds. Malaysians changed their government for the first time in the country's modern history, voting out Barisan Nasional, which had ruled for 61 years, in a shock result at the May 9 general election. The new Pakatan Harapan government made then 92-year-old Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad the country's seventh prime minister. It was his second stint as premier after an absence of 15 years. Pakatan Harapan's victory was helped by a scandal involving state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), with some US$4.5 billion (S$6.2 billion) allegedly embezzled, and voter anger over a consumption tax. More than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled a sweeping army crackdown in Myanmar's Rakhine state last year. Many now live in cramped conditions in camps in Bangladesh. In October, Bangladesh and Myanmar agreed to repatriate hundreds of thousands of refugees. But the plan has been opposed by the Rohingya and the United Nations refugee agency and aid groups, fearing for their safety. The repatriation planned for November stalled amid protests at the refugee camps. Meanwhile, Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi - once a global human rights icon - has been criticised heavily for the crackdown, with many groups withdrawing honours they had awarded her. In October, Bangladesh and Myanmar agreed to repatriate hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees. But the plan has been opposed by the Rohingya and the United Nations refugee agency and aid groups, fearing for their safety. Thousands fell victim to natural disasters. In July and August, a series of earthquakes hit Lombok, east of Bali, killing more than 500. In September, a magnitude 7.4 earthquake and tsunami in Central Sulawesi province killed more than 2,000 people. And a tsunami hit the Sunda Strait last Saturday. Earlier, in September, Typhoon Mangkhut tore through the Philippines en route to China. More than five million people were affected. Lion Air Flight JT610 ran into trouble just after take-off from Jakarta on Oct 29, with witnesses saying it crashed at high speed into the Java Sea. All 189 on board were killed in one of the worst air disasters in Indonesia. The plane was headed for Pangkal Pinang, capital of Bangka Belitung Islands province. Lion Air was using Boeing's new 737 Max 8 aircraft. The plane had been dogged by problems on several earlier flights, including its penultimate flight the night before the crash. The world watched with bated breath as Thai navy and international cave divers carried out a daring and dangerous rescue of a youth soccer team.

They were evacuated one by one, with the last person brought out on July 10. The boys and coach were praised for their bravery throughout their ordeal."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Alleged leader of Chinese consulate attack in Pakistan reported killed	"QUETTA, PAKISTAN (REUTERS) - One of the alleged masterminds of an attack by a Pakistani separatist group on the Chinese consulate in Karachi last month has been killed along with five associates, the insurgent group said on Wednesday (Dec 26). The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which opposes projects linked to China's Belt and Road infrastructure initiative in resource-rich Baluchistan, issued a statement on Tuesday confirming the death of Aslam Baloch, one of its leaders. ""The important BLA commander Aslam Baloch, along with five associates in the organisation were martyred in an enemy attack on Monday,"" Jiand Baloch, a spokesman for the separatist group said in a statement that gave no further details. Pakistan's Samaa Television reported that Aslam was killed along with a number of his commanders in a suicide attack in Aino Maina in Kandahar province, Afghanistan, across the border from Baluchistan. There was no claim of responsibility for the killings and a spokesman for the Pakistani foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment. Last month, three attackers stormed the Chinese consulate in Karachi, killing four people. Security forces killed the three attackers who were carrying explosives. Pakistan has long accused its old rival India of supporting insurgents in Baluchistan. India denies helping Baluchistan insurgents and accuses Pakistan of nurturing Islamist militants throughout the region. China has funded development of a deepwater port at Gwadar in south Baluchistan, and is also investing in other projects as part of the giant China Pakistan Economic Corridor. Baluchistan, on the borders of Afghanistan and Iran, has rich mineral and natural gas reserves but is Pakistan's poorest province. Separatists have for decades campaigned against what they see as the unfair exploitation of resources, in particular natural gas and minerals."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Communists have nothing to celebrate	"The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) on Tuesday advised peace-loving Filipinos to take extra caution and remain vigilant against attacks from the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army-National Democratic Front (CPP-NPA-NDF) which marks its 50th founding anniversary on Wednesday, stressing that they have nothing to celebrate and no achievement to be proud of. The military said that CPP founding chairman Jose Maria Sison has ordered communist rebels them to escalate attacks and violence during the Christmas season. In a statement, AFP spokesman Colonel Noel Detoyato said the threat of heightened atrocities marks another year of violence and manifests their nature as a terror group that works to undermine the government, disrupt national development, and damage public and private properties – all to the inconvenience of the Filipino people. “As far as we, peace-loving Filipinos, are concerned, the CPP-NPA-NDF has nothing to celebrate and no achievement to be proud of,” Detoyato said. “Our soldiers on the ground and at all levels of command will continue to monitor and conduct security operations against the CPP-NPA-NDF. We are ready to secure any community threatened by them especially during this season of Christmas celebration,” he added. Detoyato said the AFP’s lines of communication are also open to those who wish to take this opportunity to abandon the armed struggle and violence perpetrated by the CPP-NPA-NDF and embrace a life of peace and prosperity with their family. The alert level, he said, will be determined by field commanders on the ground. The government had earlier rejected proposal to reciprocate the annual declaration of truce by the NPA. Meanwhile, the Philippine Ecumenical Peace Platform (PEPP), a peace advocate group, said President Duterte’s order to the military to “destroy” the NPA is worrisome. The PEPP, which is composed of five church institutions or groups, said they are particularly worried about the escalation of violence and human rights violations that will surely ensue because of such statement. “As leaders of churches in the country, we are troubled by this announcement and the escalation of violence and violation of human rights that will surely ensue,” read their statement, titled “Our Enduring Call this Christmas: Resume GRP-NDFP Peace Talks!” “As we celebrate the day of birth of Jesus Christ, the bearer of hope, we affirm our belief that peace is possible through principled dialogue and that the peace talks are still the most viable option to attain a just and enduring peace in the country,” it further read. The group said House Resolution 2339, which the House of Representatives adopted to urge President Duterte to resume peace talks with the NDFP was a piece of good news for peace advocates like them. PEPP called on President Duterte to heed the House resolution and continue the peace negotiations with the NDFP and resume the formal peace talks. (With a report from Leslie Ann G.

"We're entering a very risky period': Experts say ISIS not defeated, just transforming"	" WASHINGTON (AFP) - Even as the last pockets of resistance in eastern Syria hold their ground, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group is shape-shifting into a new, but no less dangerous, underground form, experts warn. The group had long been ready to cede the territory it once held in its self-styled ""caliphate"", and has already begun the switch to a more clandestine role, closer to its roots. ""ISIS anticipated its battlefield defeat and the loss of the caliphate and prepared accordingly,"" said Professor Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University in Washington. ""Hundreds of ISIS fighters were able to flee Syria, bribe their way through Syria to Turkey and thereby disappear,"" he said. ""Beneath the surface, ISIS has always played the long game."" In a recent study entitled ""ISIS's Second Resurgence"", Mr Brandon Wallace and Ms Jennifer Cafarella of the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said the extremist group ""has already restructured its operations to return to a regional insurgency"". ""ISIS is finding new sources of revenue and rebuilding command-and-control over its scattered remnant forces in order to prepare for a future large-scale insurgency in both Iraq and Syria,"" the report said. The group has managed to smuggle funds to several countries around the Middle East, using front companies such as car dealerships, electronics stores, pharmacies and currency exchanges that it established in Iraq, experts said. ""We're entering a very risky period,"" said Mr Seth Jones of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). ""I have no faith that ISIS has been crushed, defeated."" ""They already have gone underground,"" he said. ""They are doing what everybody does who faces a better equipped opposition, with air and naval capabilities: They have to face Russian air strikes, cruise missiles."" ""What do you do in a case like that?"" he said. ""You disperse, you don't operate in platoon-size positions the way they did in 2014, you go underground, you build your clandestine network, you conduct targeted assassinations, IEDs (roadside bombs), and you wait for opportunities."" Data collected by the CSIS show that in some provinces in Iraq, such as Kirkuk in the north-east, the number of attacks attributed to ISIS doubled last year from 2017, with an average of 75 a month. The group has regularly picked off tribal leaders, government officials, police and members of the armed forces. In a television interview last month, the Iraqi Kurdish leader Massud Barzani said that ISIS ""is not defeated and will not be ended easily"". ""ISIS was on the ground, now they are underground,"" Mr Barzani said, noting that they had returned to many areas they had been driven out of even stronger than before. An ISIS fighter in Syria, who spoke to The New York Times via WhatsApp, echoed Mr Barzani's grim message. ""Do you think the Americans can defeat the caliphate?"" said the fighter, who identified himself only as Yehya. ""It's a war of attrition. When the coalition stops the air strikes, we will return immediately."" ""We didn't leave for good. We're still in Syria, even in the areas that you think we left. We still have our suicide bombers ready to attack. Our informers are active,"" he said. Prof Hoffman agreed that the US and Russia are locked in a war of attrition against the Islamists, ""and frankly we're losing it. There are nearly a quarter of a million salafi-jihadi fighters all around the world"". That is four times the number of extremists there were in 2001, when Al-Qaeda triggered the global ""war on terror"" with its jetliner suicide attacks on the US. Prof Hoffman said that while military operations may have held them at bay, Islamic State operatives ""carry within their own DNA the seeds to constantly regenerate, to continue to attract, recruit"". ""Who would have thought in the immediate aftermath of Sept 11 that 17 years later, we would still be fighting?"" he said."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Ten suspected suicide attack plotters to appear in Indian court	"NEW DELHI, Dec 27 — Ten people suspected of planning imminent suicide attacks in the New Delhi region will appear in court in the capital today, India's federal counter-terrorism agency said.

They have yet to be charged. It was not immediately clear whether the accused would be represented in court. The agency said it had recovered about 25 kg of explosives material, such as potassium nitrate and ammonium nitrate, as well as 12 pistols, a home-made rocket launcher and Islamic State-related literature. According to media reports, the interior ministry had written to state authorities in June about an all-time high threat to Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of the next general election, which must be held by May. The NIA said the main suspect arrested, a Muslim cleric, and his associates had procured weapons and explosive material to produce bombs and planned to carry out attacks at crowded places in and around Delhi. The Muslim cleric, 29, was working at a madrasa at Amroha, a town in the state of Uttar Pradesh. The accused include three Delhi students, three shopkeepers and an auto rickshaw driver. “The module was planning to strike very soon. Likely targets included vital installations, security establishments, important persons and crowded places,” NIA spokesman Alok Mittal told reporters."	Terrorism	Terrorism
 Iran arrests 10 over suicide attack on police	"TEHRAN, Dec 9 — Iranian police said today that 10 people had been arrested in connection with a suicide attack in southeastern Iran that killed two police officers. Jihadist separatist group Ansar al-Furqan has claimed responsibility for Thursday's assault in which an explosives-laden car was driven into a police station in the port city of Chabahar. The authorities have rejected the claim of responsibility for the attack, relatively rare in Iran, which also injured around 40 people. Police chief Hossein Ashtari said 10 people had been arrested, according to the conservative Fars news agency, without giving any details. Ansar al-Furqan released a photo of the alleged suicide bomber on Saturday, identified as Abdullah Aziz, according to the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadist activities. Sistan-Baluchistan province has faced decades-long insurgencies by Pakistan-based Baluchi separatists and Sunni Muslim extremists. Iran has blamed the United States and Tehran's regional rivals, Saudi Arabia and Israel, for supporting the insurgent groups."	Terrorism	Terrorism
DFA warns Filipinos to stay vigilant after Libya suicide bomb attack	"The Philippine government has advised Filipinos in Tripoli to remain vigilant and avoid unnecessary movement following a suicide bomb attack at the Libyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday.

According to Philippine Embassy Chargé d’Affaires Mardomel Melicor, three suicide bombers were involved in the attack that took place at around 10:30 a.m. (4:30 p.m. Manila time). Melicor said no Filipino has been reported to be among the casualties. The Embassy official advised the more than 2,000 Filipinos and their dependents in the Libyan capital to restrict their movement and stay indoors in the meantime."	Terrorism	Terrorism
 Catholic prelate asks Filipino in Libya to be safe following bomb attack	" A Catholic prelate asked overseas Filipino workers in Libya to always think of their safety following a suicide bomb attack there. “They must think first and foremost of their safety,” Balanga bishop Ruperto Santos, chairman of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines Episcopal Commission on Migrants and Itinerant People, said in an interview. He also asked the OFWs there to heed the call of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Philippine Embassy to be vigilant. “With dangerous situations and uncertain times in Libya, our OFWs must always listen and follow the instructions of our Philippine Embassy officials,” said Santos. The CBCP ECMI official asked the government to assist OFWs there. “Those willing to be repatriated, our government must assist and help,” Santos said. The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on Tuesday advised Filipinos in Tripoli to remain vigilant and avoid unnecessary movement. The advisory was issued in the aftermath of the suicide bomb attack at the Libyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs that reportedly left at least three persons dead and seven others injured. Although no Filipino has been reported to be among the casualties, Philippine Embassy Chargé d’Affaires Mardomel Melicor advised the more than 2,000 Filipinos and their dependents in the Libyan capital to restrict their movement and stay indoors for the time being. It was in September when the DFA raised Alert Level 3 in Libya due to the escalation of violence there. Under an Alert Level 3 from the DFA, an automatic deployment ban is imposed by the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Death toll in suicide attack rises to 43 in one of the deadliest attacks in Kabul this year	" KABUL (AFP) - An hours-long gun and suicide attack on a Kabul government compound killed at least 43 people, the health ministry said Tuesday (Dec 25), making it one of the deadliest assaults on the Afghan capital this year. Another 10 were wounded in Monday's raid on a site where the Ministry of Public Works and other offices are located, spokesman Waheed Majroh said. Gunmen stormed the compound mid-afternoon after detonating a car bomb at the entrance, sending terrifying government workers running for their lives. Some jumped from the windows. Hundreds more were trapped inside buildings as security forces swarmed the area, engaging in a fierce gun battle with the attackers. It was the deadliest attack in the Afghan capital since a suicide bomber blew himself up in the middle of a religious gathering last month, killing at least 55 people."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Gunmen kill at least 28 in raid on Afghan government building	"KABUL (REUTERS) – Gunmen who raided a government building in the Afghan capital killed at least 28 people - mostly government employees – and wounded more than 20 others in a seven-hour standoff with police that ended on Monday (Dec 24) night, Afghan authorities said. Others killed included a policeman and three of the attackers who were shot dead by Afghan security forces, Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danish said. The attack began in the afternoon when a suicide bomber blew himself up in a car outside the public works ministry. Militants then stormed the building of the National Authority for Disabled People and Martyrs’ Families, taking civilians hostage as they fought a gun battle against Afghan soldiers. Afghan security forces went from floor to floor of the building in an operation to rescue over 350 people inside, but had to exercise restraint in their operations against the attackers given the number of employees there, a senior security official said. No militant group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.  Ambulances raced to the scene during a lull in the shooting, a witness who lives nearby told Reuters. At least 20 people wounded in the clashes were taken to hospital. An official working in another government building close by said employees had locked themselves in their offices after hearing the explosions and gunfire. During the standoff, the building’s second floor caught fire, local news channels reported. Attacks on government offices are frequent and are generally carried out by the Islamist Taliban, who are fighting to expel foreign forces from strategic provinces, topple the Western-backed government and restore their version of hardline Islamic law. The 17-year-old war with the Taliban has seen both fighting and diplomacy intensify in recent months. On Thursday, an official said US President Donald Trump was planning to withdraw at least 5,000 of the 14,000 US troops in Afghanistan, a day after Trump unexpectedly announced that US troops in Syria would be withdrawn. The United States went to war in Afghanistan in 2001 in the wake of the Sept 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington, seeking to oust the Taliban militants harbouring Saudi-raised militant Osama bin Laden, who led plans to carry out the attacks. At present, American troops make up the bulk of the Resolute Support mission to train and advise Afghan forces fighting the Taliban and the Islamic State militant group. Others are part of a US-led counter-terrorism mission. The prospect of a US drawdown has triggered widespread uncertainty in war-torn Afghanistan.  With security deteriorating, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Sunday replaced his defence and interior ministers with two uncompromising opponents of the Taliban."	Terrorism	Terrorism
 At least 13 killed in Mogadishu car bomb claimed by al Shabaab	" MOGADISHU, Dec 22 —At least 13 people were killed and 17 wounded in a car bomb attack claimed by al Qaeda-linked group al Shabaab close to the president's residence in the Somali capital Mogadishu, police said on today. A second explosion followed nearby. Al Shabaab, in comments broadcast on its Radio Andalus, claimed responsibility for both blasts and said the second was also a car bomb. ""The death toll has risen to 13 people including civilians and soldiers. Seventeen others were injured. The casualties are from the two blasts,"" Major Mohamed Hussein, a police officer, told Reuters. Among those killed were a journalist, two security personnel and a driver working for local station Universal TV, whose car was passing the checkpoint at which the first blast went off, another reporter working for the station said. ""My colleague Awil Dahir Salad died in the blast together with the driver and two security guards. They were killed by the first blast as they drove. May Allah rest their souls,"" journalist Abdiasis Ibrahim who works for Universal TV, told Reuters. Police had earlier said the first car bomb at the checkpoint killed five, mostly soldiers. A Reuters witness at the scene of the second blast said he saw at least two bodies. Ahmed Abdi, another police officer, said the first car bomb exploded at a checkpoint some 400 metres from the president's residence. Al Shabaab carries out frequent attacks in Mogadishu. Its members want to dislodge the government and impose its rule based on its own strict interpretation of Islam's sharia law. The group was forced from Mogadishu in 2011 but maintains a foothold in some regions. It has killed thousands of Somalis and hundreds of civilians across East Africa in a decade-long insurgency."

Four killed in attack on Afghan security forces in Kabul	"KABUL, Dec 11 — At least four people were killed and another six injured after a suicide bomber targeted a convoy of security forces in Kabul early today, officials said, in the latest bloody Taliban-claimed attack in the Afghan capital. The blast took place in Paghman district in western Kabul as the convoy was returning from an overnight operation, interior ministry spokesman Najib Danish told AFP. “It is still not clear whether the attacker was on foot or driving a vehicle,” the spokesman added. Another security official requesting anonymity said the assailant had used a car bomb to target the convoy. Attacks on Afghan forces by the Taliban and the Islamic State group have been inflicting record-high casualties on security personnel this year. Afghan security forces, beset by killings and desertions, have been struggling to beat back insurgents since US-led Nato mostly left them on their own three years ago. In November President Ashraf Ghani said nearly 30,000 Afghan soldiers and police officers have been killed since 2015 — a figure far higher than anything previously acknowledged. Earlier this month, Lieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie — who has been nominated to lead the US military's Central Command — said the death rate among Afghan forces will no longer be sustainable unless urgent measures are taken to address recruiting and training issues. The early morning attack in Kabul came just hours after an overnight assault on a checkpoint in Arghistan district of southern Kandahar province by Taliban fighters killed at least eight Afghan police officers according to the provincial media office. “The fighting lasted several hours, eleven Taliban were also killed,” the office added. The uptick in violence comes as Washington continues to press for a negotiated end to the 17-year conflict. US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad — who is currently canvassing the region to rustle up support for potential peace talks — expressed hopes that a deal to end the war could be struck before the Afghan presidential election scheduled for April."

IS claims attack on Libya foreign ministry	" TRIPOLI, Dec 26 — Suicide attackers stormed the Libyan foreign ministry in the capital Tripoli yesterday, killing at least three people including a senior civil servant in an attack claimed by the Islamic State jihadist group. Twenty-one other people were wounded in the attack, authorities said. A car bomb exploded near the ministry, prompting security forces to rush to the scene, said special forces spokesman Tarak al-Dawass. A suicide bomber then blew himself up on the second floor of the building while a second attacker died when a suitcase he was carrying exploded, he said. A third assailant, who was unarmed and wearing a bulletproof vest, was killed by security forces outside, Dawass added. At least three people were killed and 21 wounded, according to the health ministry. Foreign Minister Tahar Siala said one of the dead was senior diplomat Ibrahim al-Shaibi who headed a department in his ministry. Plumes of smoke were seen rising from the building as ambulances, paramedics and security forces gathered outside. IS claimed the attack in a statement distributed on social media, saying that it was carried out by three “soldiers of the caliphate” who were armed with suicide belts and automatic weapons. Interior Minister Fathi Bash Agha admitted during a news conference that “security chaos” reigned in Libya and was “out of our control”. He said this was creating a “fertile ground” for IS to operate in the North African country. Torn apart by power struggles and undermined by chronic insecurity, Libya has become a haven for jihadists since the ouster and killing of Moamer Kadhafi in 2011. Two competing administrations, rival militias, tribes and jihadists have been vying for control of territory and the country's vast oil wealth. IS took advantage of the chaos to gain a foothold in the coastal city of Sirte in 2015. Forces loyal to the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) regained control of Sirte in December 2016 after eight months of deadly fighting. Since then, some jihadists have returned to the desert in an attempt to regroup and reorganise. The interior minister said his department lacked the equipment necessary to restore law and order in Libya. Bach Agha said he found “zero weapons and zero vehicles” in the ministry’s warehouses when he took up his job in October. “Weakness and a security breakdown” allowed assailants to attack the foreign ministry, he said. The foreign minister said the UN should lift an arms embargo it has imposed on Libya since the 2011 uprising. “Stability cannot be restored... without a partial lifting of the embargo. It is needed to guarantee security and combat terrorism,” Siala told reporters. The head of the UN mission in Libya (UNSMIL) denounced the “cowardly terrorist attack” in a statement. Ghassan Salame also pledged to work with Libyan people “to prevent terrorist groups from turning Libya into a haven... for their crimes”. Frank Baker, Britain’s ambassador to Libya, also denounced an “appalling terrorist attack” and tweeted his condolences to the families of the victims. Italian Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero Milanesi joined the chorus of condemnation in a statement reiterating Rome’s “solidarity with the Libyan people and their just aspiration to real security”. In September, IS claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on the headquarters of Libya’s National Oil Company in the heart of Tripoli which left two dead and 10 wounded. Four months earlier, it claimed an attack on the electoral commission’s headquarters which left 14 dead. In April, the GNA launched an operation to track down IS fighters operating in areas of western Libya under its control. Last month IS claimed responsibility for an attack on militia forces in southeastern Libya in which at least nine people were killed. The US military has regularly carried out strikes on jihadists in Libya, particularly south of Sirte. The GNA was set up under a 2015 UN-brokered deal, but a rival administration based in the country’s east aligned with military strongman Khalifa Haftar refuses to recognise its authority. Rival Libyan leaders had agreed to a Paris-brokered deal in May to hold a nationwide election by the end of the year. But instability, territorial disputes and divisions have delayed plans for elections."	Terrorism	Terrorism
43 killed in Kabul govt compound attack	"Kabul ?An hours-long gun and suicide attack on a Kabul government compound killed at least 43 people, the health ministry said Tuesday, making it one of the deadliest assaults on the Afghan capital this year. No militant group has claimed responsibility for the raid, which caps a bloody year for Afghanistan as long-suffering civilians and security forces are slaughtered in record numbers. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid told AFP the attack had “nothing to do with the militants”. Another 25 people were wounded in Monday’s massacre on a site where the Ministry of Public Works and an office that handles pensions and benefits for war veterans are located, spokesman Waheed Majroh said. Gunmen stormed the compound mid-afternoon after detonating a car bomb at the main entrance—opposite residential apartment buildings—sending terrified people running for their lives. Some jumped from windows several floors high to escape the militants. The suicide blast appears to have been a decoy, according to witnesses who told AFP they saw several militants enter the compound through a back gate. Hundreds were trapped inside the compound for hours as heavily armed security forces swarmed the area, engaging the attackers in a fierce gun battle punctuated by multiple explosions. At least four militants, including the bomber, were killed and more than 350 people freed, officials said. Most of the dead and wounded were civilians, who have borne the brunt of the 17-year war. It was the deadliest assault in the Afghan capital since a suicide bomber blew himself up in the middle of a religious gathering last month, killing at least 55 people. President Ashraf Ghani, whose government has been skewered over its security failures, said “terrorists attack civilian targets to hide their defeat on the battleground”. Afghanistan’s de facto prime minister Abdullah Abdullah also sounded a defiant note as he blamed the Taliban for the attack.“Every attack they carry out against our people, our resolve is further strengthened to eliminate them,” he said. But their statements belie the grim reality on the battlefield where the Taliban have the upper hand. Afghanistan’s largest militant group has made significant territorial gains this year as its fighters inflict record casualties on government forces. The raid followed a tumultuous few days in Afghanistan where officials are reeling from US President Donald Trump’s plan to slash troop numbers, which many fear could harm efforts to end the conflict with the Taliban. It also comes after a major security shake-up in Kabul that has placed staunch anti-Taliban and Pakistan veterans in charge of the police and military. While there has been no official announcement of a US drawdown, the mere suggestion of the United States reducing its military presence has rattled the Afghan capital and potentially undermined peace efforts. General Scott Miller, the top US and NATO commander in Afghanistan, said Sunday he had not received orders to pull forces out of the country. Trump’s decision apparently came Tuesday as US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad met with the Taliban in Abu Dhabi, part of efforts to bring the militants to the negotiating table with Kabul. Many Afghans are worried that Ghani’s fragile unity government would collapse if US troops pulled out, enabling the Taliban to sweep back into power and potentially sparking another bloody civil war."

Terror attacker was ‘inspired by Islamic State	"Sydney?A Somali-born Australian who went on a deadly knife rampage in the country’s second-largest city of Melbourne was inspired by Islamic State but did not have a direct link to the jihadist group, the government said Sunday. Hassan Khalif Shire Ali stabbed to death well-known local cafe co-owner Sisto Malaspina and injured two other men in Bourke Street in the heart of Melbourne on Friday afternoon before he was shot and killed by police. The 30-year-old had gone to the bustling city in a utility vehicle filled with gas cylinders before setting it alight. Islamic State said via its propaganda arm that Shire Ali was an “Islamic State fighter and carried out the operation”, but provided no evidence to back its claim. “In relation to his connections with ISIL (another name for IS) or with any terrorist group... there’s not, as I’m advised, a membership of an organization or a definite link to ISIL,” Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton told reporters in Brisbane. “The working theory is at the moment a case where this person has been downloading information or receiving messages in his own mind about what he should be doing. It’s inspired as opposed to affiliation or membership.” Shire Ali, known to the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO), had his passport revoked in 2015 on fears he was trying to travel to Syria to join IS. But he was also assessed by authorities as not being a domestic threat. Dutton defended the actions of ASIO, saying they had more than 400 investigations and people of interest to monitor.“Police did not have intelligence in relation to this person that he was about to commit an act,” he added. “The fact is that many people, particularly where there is a low level of sophistication, where you have someone who can grab a knife from a kitchen drawer... it is impossible for authorities to cover every one of those circumstances.” Dutton’s comments came as Melbourne’s Herald Sun reported Sunday that Shire Ali had drug and alcohol problems, and had split from his wife and become distanced from his family. Melbourne’s The Age raised questions about his mental health, quoting a local imam as saying Shire Ali told him he was being “chased by unseen people with spears”. Meanwhile more than Aus$50,000 (US$36,000) has been raised on GoFundMe for a bystander dubbed “trolley man”, who was hailed as a hero for trying to stop Shire Ali by knocking him over with a shopping cart. The man, named in local media as Michael Rogers, is homeless according to the GoFundMe page creators. Authorities say more than a dozen terrorist attacks have been prevented in recent years, but several have taken place, including a cafe siege in Sydney in 2014 where two hostages were killed. Shire Ali’s brother will go on trial next year on separate terror-related charges?accused of trying to acquire a firearm and kill people in a New Years’ Eve crowd."	Terrorism	Terrorism

Grandma devastated by ISIS video showing boy coached to kill Australians	"SYDNEY (AFP) - The devastated grandmother of a young boy filmed being coached to kill Australians has lashed out at his notorious ISIS fighter father for using him as a ""media tool"". Footage surfaced in Australia on Sunday (April 30) of Australian Khaled Sharrouf grilling his six-year-old son Hamze in Syria about how to murder non-Muslims. It reportedly showed the boy holding guns and a knife and making threats as a voice off-camera asked him: ""How do you kill an Australian?"" Sharrouf, the first Australian to be stripped of his citizenship under anti-terrorism laws, made international headlines in 2014 when he posted an image on Twitter of another son holding a severed head. The children's grandmother Karen Nettleton, whose daughter left Australia for Syria in 2013 with her young family to join Sharrouf but has since reportedly died, said she was disgusted to see the latest images. ""Everybody out there is going to see it and think he's a little terrorist. I don't know how his father could have done it to him. I really don't understand that,"" she told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Monday evening. ""He (Hamze) was the baby out of all of them. I rocked him to sleep, I sang him songs, I took him swimming. ""It kills me because I know he's just a six-year-old little boy. I know what's he's like. He's just being used, I think as some sort of media tool."" Nettleton has been fighting for three years to bring her five grandchildren - three boys and two girls - back to Australia, and insisted they were not lost to Islamic State. ""They're not lost, they're not gone. They're just kids, with the right help they will be OK,"" she said. The ABC said the video had been made by Sharrouf, once thought killed in a drone strike, with the aim of selling it to Australian media, but there were no takers. It was accompanied by a photo which showed the boy in front of a strung-up corpse of a man in an orange jumpsuit with a poster round his neck saying he was a traitor, the broadcaster added. Justice Minister Michael Keenan slammed the ""appalling"" use of a child in extremist propaganda. ""The Australian government condemns this truly appalling act of using a child to espouse ISIL's terrorist messaging,"" he said at the weekend, referring to the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Canberra lifted its terror threat alert level in September 2014 and introduced new national security laws amid concerns of attacks by individuals inspired by organisations such as ISIS. It also cracked down on Australians attempting to travel to conflict zones including Syria and Iraq."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Libya strikes kill more than 80 ISIS fighters	"LIBYA (REUTERS) - US military strikes in Libya on Wednesday night (Jan 18) have killed more than 80 fighters from the Islamic State, some of whom were believed to be actively plotting attacks in Europe, US Defense Secretary Ash Carter said on Thursday (Jan 19). “We need to strike ISIL everywhere they show up. And that's particularly true in view of the fact that we know some of the ISIL operatives in Libya were involved with plotting attacks,” Carter said. A Pentagon spokesman said an initial assessment indicated the US military strikes destroyed two camps southwest of Sirte, Libya. Libyan forces backed by US airstrikes finished clearing the last Islamic State holdout in Sirte last month after a battle of nearly seven months for the militant group's former North African stronghold. The US also carried out about 470 air strikes against Islamic State targets in Sirte during that campaign. The loss of Sirte was a major blow for Islamic State, leaving the group without any territory in Libya, although it retains an active presence in parts of the vast country. The jihadist group took over Sirte in early 2015, turning it into its most important base outside the Middle East and attracting large numbers of foreign fighters into the city. It imposed its ultra-hardline rule on residents, and extended its control along about 250km of Libya's Mediterranean coastline. Since Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown in 2011 by rebel forces backed by NATO air strikes, Libya has slipped deeper into chaos."	Terrorism	Terrorism
From caliph to fugitive: ISIS leader Baghdadi on the run	"BAGHDAD/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is on the brink of losing the two main centres of his 'caliphate' but even though he is on the run, it may take years to capture or kill him, officials and experts said. ISIS fighters are close to defeat in the twin capitals of the group's territory, Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria, and officials say Baghdadi is steering clear of both, hiding in thousands of square kilometres of desert between the two. ""In the end, he will either be killed or captured, he will not be able to remain underground forever,"" said Lahur Talabany, the head of counter-terrorism at the Kurdistan Regional Government, the Kurdish autonomous region in northern Iraq. ""But this is a few years away still,"" he told Reuters. One of Baghdadi's main concerns is to ensure those around him do not betray him for the US$25 million (S$34.60) reward offered by the United States to bring him ""to justice"", said Hisham al-Hashimi, who advises Middle East governments on ISIS affairs. ""With no land to rule openly, he can no longer claim the title caliph,"" Hashimi said. ""He is a man on the run and the number of his supporters is shrinking as they lose territory."" Iraqi forces have retaken much of Mosul, the northern Iraqi city the hardline group seized in June 2014 and from which Baghdadi declared himself ""caliph"" or leader of all Muslims shortly afterwards. Raqqa, his capital in Syria, is nearly surrounded by a coalition of Syrian Kurdish and Arab groups. The last public video footage of him shows him dressed in black clerical robes declaring his caliphate from the pulpit of Mosul's medieval Grand al-Nuri mosque back in 2014. Born Ibrahim al-Samarrai, Baghdadi is a 46-year-old Iraqi who broke away from Al-Qaeda in 2013, two years after the capture and killing of the group's leader Osama bin Laden. He grew up in a religious family, studied Islamic theology in Baghdad and joined the Salaafi Islamist insurgency in 2003, the year of the US-led invasion of Iraq. He was caught by the Americans who released him about a year later as they considered him then as a civilian rather than a military target. He is shy and reserved, Hashimi said, and has recently stuck to the sparsely populated Iraq-Syria border where drones and strangers are easy to spot. The US Department of State's Counter-Terrorism Rewards Programme had put the same US$25 million bounty on Bin Laden and Iraqi former president Saddam Hussein and the reward is still available for Bin Laden's successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Neither Saddam nor Bin Laden were voluntarily betrayed, but the bounties complicated their movements and communications. ""The reward creates worry and tension, it restricts his movements and limit the number of his guards,"" said Fadhel Abu Ragheef, a Baghdad-based expert on extremist groups. ""He doesn't stay more than 72 hours in any one place."" Baghdadi ""has become nervous and very careful in his movements"", said Talabany, whose services are directly involved in countering ISIS plots. ""His circle of trust has become even smaller."" His last recorded speech was issued in early November, two weeks after the start of the Mosul battle, when he urged his followers to fight the ""unbelievers"" and ""make their blood flow as rivers"". US and Iraqi officials believe he has left operational commanders behind with diehard followers to fight the battles of Mosul and Raqqa, to focus on his own survival. It is not possible to confirm his whereabouts. Baghdadi does not use phones and has a handful number of approved couriers to communicate with his two main aides, Iyad al-Obaidi, his defence minister, and Ayad al-Jumaili, in charge of security. There was no confirmation of an April 1 Iraqi state TV report that Jumaili had been killed. Baghdadi moves in ordinary cars, or the kind of pick-up trucks used by farmers, between hideouts on both sides of the Iraqi-Syrian border, with just a driver and two bodyguards, said Hashimi. The region is well known to his men as the hotbed of the Sunni insurgency against US forces that invaded Iraq and later the Shi'ite-led governments that took over the country. At the height of its power two years ago, ISIS ruled over millions of people in territory running from northern Syria through towns and villages along the Tigris and Euphrates river valleys to the outskirts of the Iraqi capital Baghdad. It persecuted non-Sunnis and even Sunnis who did not agree with its extreme version of Islamic law, with public executions and whippings for violating strict controls on appearance, behaviour and movement. But the group has been retreating since in the face of a multitude of local, regional and international forces, driven into action by the scores of deadly attacks around the world that it has claimed or inspired. A few hundred thousand people now live in the areas under the group's control, in and around Raqqa and Deir Ezzor, in Syria's east, and in a few pockets south and west of Mosul. Hashimi said ISIS was moving some fighters out of Raqqa before it was encircled to regroup in Deir Ezzor. Mosul, with pre-war population of 2 million, was at least four times the size of any other the group has held. Up to 200,000 people are still trapped in the Old City, ISIS' besieged enclave in Mosul, lacking supplies and being used as human shields to obstruct the progress of Iraqi forces by a US-led international coalition. The Syrian Democratic Forces, made of Kurdish and Arab groups supported by the US-led coalition, began to attack Raqqa last week, after a months-long campaign to cut it off. The militants are also fighting Russian and Iranian-backed forces in Syria loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, and mainly Sunni Muslim Syrian rebels backed by Turkey. The last official report about Baghdadi was from the Iraqi military on Feb 13. Iraqi F-16s carried out a strike on a house where he was thought to be meeting other commanders, in western Iraq, near the Syrian border, it said. Overall, ISIS has 8,000 fighters left, of which 2,000 are foreigners from other Arab states, Europe, Russia and central Asia, said Abu Ragheef. ""A small number compared to the tens of thousands arrayed against them in both countries, but a force to be reckoned with, made up of die-hards with nothing to lose, hiding in the middle of civilians and making extensive use of booby traps, mines and explosives,"" he said. The US government has a joint task force to track down Baghdadi which includes special operations forces, the CIA and other US intelligence agencies, as well as spy satellites of the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. It will take more than that to erase his influence, Talabany said. ""He is still considered the leader of ISIL and many continue to fight for him; that hasn't changed drastically,"" he said, using an alternate ISIS acronym. Even if killed or captured, he added, ""his legacy and that of ISIL will endure unless radical extremism is tackled."""	Terrorism	Terrorism
Fighters on Raqqa front line brace for final showdown with Islamic State	"RAQQA (Syria), Oct 10 — In the gutted four-storey building that he and five other US-backed fighters have turned into a frontline fortress, Babel can peer out at Islamic State positions just 150m away. The jihadist militants expected to make a last stand for this stronghold of their self-proclaimed caliphate are cornered and desperate here in Raqqa, the city on the Euphrates river that has served as their de-facto Syrian capital since 2014. “Let Daesh come — we’re ready for them. We have explosives to drop downstairs,” said Babel, which is his nom de guerre. He and his fellow members of the US-backed Syrian Defence Forces have occupied the frontline building for three weeks and are now preparing for a final showdown with Islamic State, the group also known as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh. The SDF fighters’ position is well prepared in case the cornered IS militants attempt an attack. The front porch steps have been demolished, leaving a drop to the basement that can be crossed only by climbing a section of iron fence - a makeshift ladder, which the defenders can pull up. Inside, plastic bottles have been strewn across the floor to squeak when stepped on and alert them to intruders. After months of intense fighting and heavy US bombardment, the SDF have surrounded Islamic State militants in a small part of the city. As the Kurdish and Arab militias of the SDF close in and US-led air raids increase, they expect fierce fighting to mark the final stages of the campaign. “Daesh regularly launch small raids, even behind our position. Yesterday they attacked the building opposite and tried to push towards us. We killed a few and they retreated to the hospital,” Babel said. SDF units have a clear view over the Raqqa hospital, one of Islamic State’s last strongholds in the city, from a line of buildings they occupy to its northwest. Apartment blocks between them and the hospital have been flattened by air strikes. Commanders say the hospital and a nearby stadium, where the jihadists are said to be holding civilian hostages, will be where they make their last stand. Babel’s unit are holding the front line ahead of an anticipated final push, firing at militants whenever they can spot them. “The last few nights they’ve been shining spotlights from the hospital towards our lines, so we can’t really see,” he said. Another fighter in the unit said sniper fire from Islamic State had recently reduced, possibly as a means of conserving ammunition for more intense fighting to come. An SDF field commander said on Sunday assaults were to begin soon as part of a final push against Islamic State, focused initially on surrounding the stadium. The hospital is already encircled. “Daesh is amassing, preparing to fight. This is the last stage, so they’ll resist and then surrender or die,” the commander who gave his name as Ardal Raqqa said. US coalition spokesman Ryan Dillon was more cautious about calling the current stage of the offensive a final assault. “Whether this is the final assault or an assault, I won’t characterise it either way,” Dillon said by phone. The fight was “concentrated around the complex which was the national hospital and the stadium,” he said. The SDF predicted ahead of a major push in June that it could take just weeks to drive Islamic State out of Raqqa. That has proven overly optimistic, with the militants holding out for months so far. Their use of civilians for cover, tunnels to launch counter attacks, snipers and countless booby traps have slowed SDF advances. “Many are being wounded, especially by snipers. Daesh snipers often shoot to wound, not to kill, so they can target whoever comes to save an injured comrade,” Babel said. One shaken SDF fighter in a nearby base last week showed cuts on his face from where a sniper bullet had ricocheted. Both the US spokesman Dillon and the SDF fighter Babel said that some Islamic State fighters were surrendering. “The other day a Saudi fighter escaped and handed himself over. The guys who surrender usually have families,” Babel said. Interrogations of surrendering militants revealed IS had dug a tunnel between the hospital and stadium, he said. Dillon said several IS militants and leaders had surrendered in recent weeks. “It is a growing trend,” he said. At the front line, SDF fighters said morale was high. One fighter belted pop music to other units over his walkie talkie. “Hopefully we’ll be done soon,” Babel said."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"ISIS fighters, having pledged to fight or die, surrender en masse"	"DIBIS, Iraq — The prisoners were taken to a waiting room in groups of four, and were told to stand facing the concrete wall, their noses almost touching it, their hands bound behind their backs. More than 1,000 prisoners determined to be Islamic State fighters passed through that room last week after they fled their crumbling Iraqi stronghold of Hawija. Instead of the martyrdom they had boasted was their only acceptable fate, they had voluntarily ended up here in the interrogation centre of the Kurdish authorities in northern Iraq. For an extremist group that has made its reputation on its ferociousness, with fighters who would always choose suicide over surrender, the fall of Hawija has been a notable turning point. The group has suffered a string of humiliating defeats in Iraq and Syria, but the number of its shock troops who turned themselves in at the centre in Dibis was unusually large, more than 1,000 since last Sunday, according to Kurdish intelligence officials. The fight for Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, took nine months, and by comparison, relatively few Islamic State fighters surrendered. Tal Afar fell next, and more quickly, in only 11 days. Some 500 fighters surrendered there. ADVERTISEMENT The Iraqi military ousted the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL, from Hawija in 15 days, saying it had taken its forces only three days of actual heavy fighting before most of the extremists grabbed their families and ran. According to Kurdish officials, they put up no fight at all, other than planting bombs and booby traps. Seen up close, the fighters' pretence of bravado soon disappears. Their shoes were taken from them, their pockets emptied and their belts discarded, and, as they stood facing the wall, the backs of their dishdashas were stained with the evidence that some of them had not been to a toilet in days. One of the men smelled so bad that when he was taken into the small interrogation room, those inside were startled. He filled the doorway, appearing even larger than his actual size. The interrogator unbuckled his hip holster, resting his right hand on his pistol. Everyone in the room seemed scared of the man, even though his hands were tied behind his back. His thick black hair was Medusa-wild and shoulder-length, though his handsome face had only a wisp of black stubble on the chin. ""Hello,"" a visitor said. ""Where's your beard?"" The Islamic State requires all men to grow full beards. ""I'm only 21, I can't grow it yet,"" he said, clearly embarrassed. Kurdish interrogators allowed a dozen of the surrendered fighters to be interviewed by a reporter as they arrived at the local headquarters of the Asayish, the Kurdish intelligence service, in the town of Dibis, near the Kurds' front lines opposite Hawija. Officers monitored all interviews. Many of the fighters claimed to have been just cooks or clerks. So many said they had been members of the Islamic State for only a month or two that interrogators suspected they had been coached to say that. Gone was the contempt for the world's opinion, spewed out in one violent video after another — many of them made in Hawija, where grisly killings, especially of Kurdish prisoners, were the norm during their three-year reign over that Sunni Arab city in northern Iraq. Most of the prisoners, though, claimed to have never seen a beheading, or even heard of such a thing. At first, the beardless fighter seemed an exception, admitting defiantly that he had been fighting for the group for two years, alongside family members. He readily gave his name: ""Maytham Muhammed Mohemin,"" he said, practically spitting it out. His hands were bound behind his back and he was effectively sitting on them, forced back into a red plastic lawn chair, yet the three Kurdish officers in the room kept more than an arm's length away in case he lunged for their weapons. During the interview, he grew nervous. He said he was from Hawija and had joined the Islamic State because he believed in its cause, because his elder brother had, and because the $100 a month pay was better than anything else around. He had arrived in Dibis on Thursday (Oct 5) afternoon with eight companions, seven Iraqis and an Egyptian, after they dropped their weapons in Hawija that morning. Since the beginning of the Iraqi offensive two weeks earlier, they had spent most of the time burrowed in foxholes to escape the relentless US bombing and shelling by advancing Iraqi forces, and had passed days without sanitary facilities or food. Finally, the Islamic State wali, or governor of Hawija, told the men to turn themselves in to the Kurdish forces, known as the peshmerga, and to flee the advancing Iraqi army and its Shiite militia allies, the Iranian-trained Hashed al-Shaabi, notorious for killing not only Islamic State prisoners but also their entire families. ""The governor told us each to ""solve your own problem and find your own solution for yourself,'"" Mohemin said. ""He said, *Go to the peshmerga, not to the Hashed.'"" Mohemin denied ever attending a beheading but later, prompted by an Asayish intelligence officer, he admitted going to one, he said, because he had been ordered to. ""I was scared,"" he said. ""I never saw anything like that in my life."" His prospects are grim. His pregnant wife had fled to Dibis a week before him, but it was unlikely he would see her or their expected child, their first, anytime soon. His elder brother was killed in combat. His father and little brother, one too old to pledge to the Islamic State and the other too young, had disappeared. The interrogator, Lt. Pisthiwan Salahi, said Mohemin was not only an Islamic State soldier but also a member of an elite suicide squad known as the Seekers of Martyrdom, according to informers. If convicted of that affiliation by an Asayish court, his sentence would be long; if he was connected to any killings, possibly lifelong. Mohemin's narrative differed. ""I was just a common soldier,"" he said. ""I never killed a civilian. I wasn't even on the front line."" The lieutenant scoffed at him. ""Well, twice I was on the front line, just for a day, but not against the Kurds,"" Mohemin said. More scoffing. ""Well once against the Kurds, but only shooting from a distance. I couldn't see anyone."" Kurdish officials have been perplexed by the number of fighters who have surrendered. Many of the militants said they were ordered by their leaders to turn themselves in to the Kurds, who were known to take prisoners instead of killing them. But Capt. Ali Muhammed Syan, chief of the Asayish interrogators in Dibis, said even the fighters did not seem to know why their leaders were telling them to quit. ""Maybe it's some deal,"" he said. ""Maybe it's just bad morale, I don't know."" To identify the militants, Kurdish intelligence officers pored over videos from Hawija, such as ones showing peshmerga prisoners in orange jump suits in individual cages on the backs of pickup trucks, being paraded through town to be stoned, then set afire or beheaded in public. Crowds of thousands participated. One by one the Islamic State prisoners were taken out of the waiting room line to be interviewed, each telling pretty much the same story. ""I pledged to ISIS in January 2015 and left in March,"" said Raad Abdullah Ahmad, 31. ""My family disowned me after that. Imagine having no family. I left because I didn't like what they did to people."" Another, Hussein Jamal, 21, said he had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in 2014 but had remained only 45 days. ""Ask him why he didn't come out sooner then,"" one of the interrogators suggested. ""I was afraid,"" Jamal said. ""Ask them why they fled this way,"" another of the interrogators suggested. Both men said that they were certain that the Hashed al-Shaabi militias would kill them, but that the Kurds would not. ""Why not?"" ""They are more civilised than we are,"" Ahmad said. ""They know who is good and who is bad."" Mohemin had shrunk back into his red chair after an hour of talking and looked much smaller than before. When asked if he thought he would see his wife again, or his new child, he said, ""I don't know,"" and looked at the floor. The lieutenant did not take his eyes off him for a second. ""They're just planning to go underground and make sleeper cells,"" he said. Mohemin shook his head. ""This is the end of this state,"" he said. He had wet his trousers, adding to the smell, but did not ask to use a toilet. ""I believe if the governors are telling us to surrender, it really means that this is the end."" He swore to God that he was telling the truth.

 Fil-Am in North Carolina gets life term for plotting mayhem with ISIS	" ASHEVILLE, North Carolina — A North Carolina man accused of plotting a U.S. terror attack that he discussed with a member of the Islamic State group received a life sentence on Tuesday, June 27. Justin Sullivan, 21, (a Filipino American) pleaded guilty in November. The Morganton man is also accused of killing his neighbor and stealing his money so he could buy an assault rifle to carry out an IS-inspired shooting at a concert or club. A doctor will observe Sullivan to determine if he’s predisposed to schizophrenia. The defense argued that being placed in a high-security prison could trigger schizophrenia. Prosecutors asked for a determination on the Clarke murder, but the judge only ruled on the acts of terror. The judge said he didn’t need to make a decision on the homicide case because that is the state’s responsibility. Prosecutors say Sullivan spoke with Junaid Hussain in June 2015 via social media about making a video of a terrorist attack in the U.S. to be used by the militant group. Hussain was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Syria in August 2015. Prosecutors said in a statement that Sullivan pleaded guilty to attempting to commit an act of terrorism – planning to kill hundreds of innocent people to prove his allegiance to the terrorist group ISIL. Prosecutors say Sullivan also admitted to regular contact with Junaid Hussain, one of ISIL’s prominent members in Syria, who asked Sullivan to make a video of the deadly attack. “It is frightening to know that the defendant in this case was able to use social media to contact and seek advice from ISIL, a murderous organization,” Rose said. Prosecutors said Sullivan watched violent ISIL attacks on the Internet, including beheadings, expressed support for the group and destroyed religious items that belonged to his parents. His father, retires US Marines Capt. Rich Sullivan, reported his son to the police. The young Sullivan also told an undercover FBI employee that he planned to buy a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle at a gun show and tried buying hollow point ammunition to use with the gun in June 2015."

" US, Australian officials warn of returning foreign fighters"	"Top US and Australian officials on Monday warned battle-hardened and angry foreign fighters may return to Southeast Asia from the Middle East and take up arms in their own countries. The warning follows this weekend’s terror attacks in London, which were claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group, and amid a growing jihadist threat in the Philippines. In the Philippines, hundreds of civilians are trapped by fighting between the military and Islamist militants who have overrun the city of Marawi on the restive southern region of Mindanao. READ: Fear, confusion as Marawi is devastated by fighting IS fighters will “come back with battlefield skills, they’ll come back with hardened ideology, they’ll come back angry, frustrated, and we need to be very aware of that,” Australian Defense Minister Marise Payne said. She was speaking at the start of an Australia-US ministerial summit also attended by Pentagon chief Jim Mattis, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and his Australian counterpart Julie Bishop. Reacting to the London attacks, Mattis said: “We are united … in our resolve, even against an enemy that thinks by hurting us, they can scare us. Well, we don’t scare.” US President Donald Trump has instructed the Pentagon to “annihilate” IS in a bid to prevent escaped foreign fighters from returning home as they lose ground in Iraq and Syria. The move to encircle then kill as many jihadists in place as possible—rather than letting them exit a city and targeting them as they flee—reflects an increased urgency to stop them bringing their military expertise and ideology back to Western capitals and other areas. Bishop told the Americans that the issue of countering terrorism would be high on the agenda at Monday’s annual talks. “The global terrorist threat is ever evolving, we’ve seen brutal attacks in a number of European cities, we’ve thwarted attacks here in Australia, and so we want to discuss with you the links back into the Middle East,” she said. Australian officials say they have prevented 12 terror attacks on home soil since 2014 with more than 60 people charged. The US and Australian officials were scheduled to hold a press conference later Monday."	Terrorism	Terrorism
G7 demands internet giants crack down on extremist content	"The G7 nations on Friday demanded action from internet providers and social media firms against extremist content online, vowing to step up their fight against terrorism after this week’s Manchester attack. British Prime Minister Theresa May won solidarity from her G7 colleagues at summit talks in Italy after the suicide bombing Monday at a pop concert killed 22 people, including several children. The G7 also vowed a collective effort to track down and prosecute foreign fighters dispersing from conflicts such as Syria, which May said showed the morphing nature of the threat. “We agreed the threat from Daesh is evolving rather than disappearing,” she told a news conference, referring to the Islamic State group, also known by the acronyms of ISIS and ISIL. “As they lose ground in Iraq and Syria, foreign fighters are returning and the group’s hateful ideology is spreading online,” May said. “Make no mistake — the fight is moving from the battlefield to the internet.” May then headed home early from the summit to confront the “critical” threat still facing Britain. The United States, France and Britain’s other partners in the G7 laid out their strategy in a joint statement adopted at the summit in Sicily. They called on internet service providers and social media companies “to substantially increase their efforts to address terrorist content”. “We encourage industry to act urgently in developing and sharing new technology and tools to improve the automatic detection of content promoting incitement to violence, and we commit to supporting industry efforts in this vein including the proposed industry-led forum for combating online extremism,” they said. Elders at the Manchester mosque where the bomber sometimes worshiped suggest that he may have been radicalized online, by accessing content that is freely available from the likes of the Islamic State group. Pressure has been building on social media giants amid accusations they are doing too little, too late to eradicate hate speech and extremist recruitment done on their sites. Three weeks ago, Facebook said it was hiring an extra 3,000 staff to remove violent content such as gruesome killings and suicides broadcast on its video platform. European authorities meanwhile are increasingly concerned about the threat posed by foreign fighters who went to join the Islamic State group but are now dispersing as the jihadists come under pressure on the battlefield. The stepped-up G7 cooperation comes amid fears that the Manchester bomber had been to Syria after visiting his parents’ homeland of Libya. “It is vital we do more to cooperate with our partners in the region to step up returns and prosecutions of foreign fighters,” May said. One prosecution was recently brought against such a fighter in Turkey, and Britain now wants G7 action to help local authorities wage more prosecutions in Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, a British government spokesperson said. “This means improving intelligence-sharing, evidence gathering and bolstering countries’ police and legal processes,” May said. According to a senior British government source, May urged the G7 countries to share police expertise and border security methods with countries where foreign fighters travel through or fight in. Names and nationalities of foreign fighters should be shared to help their identification by different countries as they cross borders. “When our allies find evidence, such as video or papers, of illegal activity involving foreign fighters, for example a Brit in a conflict zone, they should pass that to our authorities. It may help prosecute foreign fighters when they return,” the source said."	Terrorism	Terrorism
 Indonesian police kill four men who attacked Riau HQ	"JAKARTA • Indonesian police shot dead four men after they used samurai swords to attack officers at the Riau provincial police headquarters in the city of Pekanbaru in Sumatra yesterday, days after a wave of deadly suicide bombings in another part of the country. National police spokesman Setyo Wasisto told a briefing that the men had slammed a minivan into a gate at the station before getting out to stage the attack. Inspector-General Setyo said a police officer was killed after one of the perpetrators tried to escape and crashed into him, while two officers were wounded in the attack. ""The one who escaped has been captured and secured at Pekanbaru police station,"" he said. An internal police report said one of the dead men in the Pekanbaru attack had a suspected bomb strapped to his body, although Insp-Gen Setyo did not comment on this. Television images showed what were reportedly the bodies of four suspects lying on the ground. There was a long sword next to one body. A journalist who had been at the police station yesterday was also hurt after being hit by the car. A press conference about a drug bust was under way when the attack took place. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) militant group, which claimed responsibility for the series of recent attacks in East Java province, said it was also behind the Pekanbaru attack, according to the group's Amaq news agency. It offered no evidence in support of the claim. Insp-Gen Setyo said the men belonged to the Islamic State of Indonesia network in Riau, or NII, ""which is part of the ISIS network in Indonesia"". Police said three of the Pekanbaru attackers were Riau residents aged between 26 and 42. Four of the men involved in the attack had previously tried to help terror detainees who were rioting at a maximum-security police lock-up outside Jakarta last week, he said. It was not clear, however, if the four were the same men shot dead by police yesterday. Insp-Gen Setyo said they had travelled from Sumatra to help the rioters, but returned as the situation had been defused. The attack comes as Indonesia has been rocked by deadly attacks on churches and a police station in the city of Surabaya, in East Java province, over the past few days that have left more than 20 people dead, including 13 suspected perpetrators. The multiple suicide bombings were carried out by families who had even included their young children. An explosion also occurred on Sunday at an apartment in neighbouring Sidoarjo regency, where militants were suspected to have been constructing bombs, police said. The attacks were the worst in the world's biggest Muslim-majority country since the bombing of tourist-packed restaurants in Bali in 2005. Police suspect the East Java attacks were carried out by a cell of the Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) militant group. JAD, an umbrella organisation that is believed to have drawn hundreds of Indonesian sympathisers of ISIS, is on a United States State Department terrorist list. Although the NII is separate from the JAD group, Insp-Gen Setyo said they were both part of the wider pro-ISIS network in Indonesia. ""They all pledged allegiance to (ISIS leader) Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,"" he said. Indonesia - which is set to host the Asian Games in three months and an International Monetary Fund-World Bank meeting in Bali in October - has long struggled with Islamist militancy, including the 2002 Bali bombings that killed more than 200 people - mostly foreign tourists - in the country's worst terror attack. After some major successes tackling Islamist militancy since 2001, Indonesia has seen a resurgence in recent years, including in January 2016, when four suicide bombers and gunmen attacked a shopping area in the capital Jakarta. Police have been frequent targets of mostly low-level attacks by local militants, including a suicide bombing at a bus station in Jakarta last year that killed three police officers. This week's bloody violence is putting pressure on lawmakers to pass a stalled security law that would give police more power to take pre-emptive action against people suspected of planning terror attacks. Indonesia's elite anti-terror force Densus 88 has responded with a series of raids in which several suspected militants have been shot dead - including the second-ranking member of the JAD cell in Surabaya. Meanwhile, the police anti-terror squad yesterday arrested three militants on the outskirts of Jakarta.

Philippine police kill 2 brothers suspected to be members of local ISIS cell	"DAVAO CITY, THE PHILIPPINES (BERNAMA) - Philippine police shot and killed two brothers suspected to be members of a local cell of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terror group in the southern Philippines late on Sunday (Oct 14), the authorities said on Monday. Senior Superintendent Ferlu Silvio, the provincial police chief for Davao del Sur police, identified the slain suspects as Norhan Delangalen Sinapan and his brother, Norton Delangalen Sinapan, according to Xinhua news agency. He said Norhan was the leader of an ISIS cell known as Daulah Islamiyah, based in the city of Digos, in Davao del Sur province. Supt Silvio said the operation against the brothers was carried out by combined police units, who swooped on their hideout at a seaside community at 11pm local time. Seized from the slain suspects were a handgun, several rounds of ammunition, a component for an improvised bomb, a fragmentation grenade and two black flags with ISIS markings, the police official said. The southern Philippines has been on alert following reports that terrorists who swore allegiance to the terror network had regrouped after they were routed and expelled by Philippine troops from Marawi City late last year after five months of heavy fighting. A series of bombings in the southern Philippine town of Isulan in August and September that killed four people and wounded scores of others were blamed on local ISIS-affiliated extremists."

Indonesian police detain three over suspected plot to attack assembly	"JAKARTA, June 3 — Indonesian anti-terrorism police have detained three former students in a raid on a university campus in Pekanbaru, on Sumatra island, and seized crude bombs and other explosive material, police said. The men, who have been named as suspects, are thought to have been planning to attack the local parliament in Pekanbaru, the capital of Riau province, national police spokesman Setyo Wasisto said in a statement. During yesterday’s raid on a faculty at Riau University, police found a pipe bomb, a homemade grenade, as well as the homemade explosive triacetone triperoxide (TATP), known as the “mother of Satan”, Wasisto said. They also seized an air rifle and sets of bows and arrows, as well as other material such as fertiliser that could be used to make bombs, he said. Authorities have highlighted concerns about a rise in radicalism at universities in the world’s biggest Muslim-majority country. A number of recent surveys of students have pointed to significant support for Islamic State, carrying out jihad and the establishment of a caliphate in Indonesia. After some major successes tackling Islamist militancy in the last two decades, there have also been a resurgence of attacks in recent years. Last month, police shot dead four men who used samurai swords to attack officers at police headquarters in Pekanbaru. That attack came soon after a series of suicide bombings by militants targeting churches and a police building in Indonesia’s second-biggest of city of Surabaya. In all, about 30 people were killed in the attacks in Surabaya, including 13 of the suspected suicide bombers. Police say the bombers belonged to cells of the Islamic State-inspired Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), an umbrella organization on a US State Department terrorist list that is reckoned to have drawn hundreds of Indonesian sympathisers."

"UN Security Council condemns ‘heinous, cowardly terrorist attack” in Jolo"	"Members of the Security Council of the United Nations on Tuesday condemned in the strongest terms what it called “heinous and cowardly terrorist attack” that occurred at Jolo Cathedral in Sulu on January 27. In a statement, the members of the Security Council likewise expressed their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and to the Philippines government and they wished a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured. At least 21 people were killed and dozens of others were wounded when two separate explosions rocked the Our Lady of Carmel Cathedral in Jolo during a Sunday morning mass. “The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security,” they said. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/Da’esh) has claimed responsibility on the Jolo cathedral attack. Moreover, the members of the powerful Security Council underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice, even as they urged all States, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant Security Council resolutions, “to cooperate actively with the Government of the Philippines and all other relevant authorities in this regard.” “The members of the Security Council reiterated that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed,” they added. Similarly, the Security Council members reaffirmed the need for all States to “combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and other obligations under international law, including international human rights law, international refugee law and international humanitarian law, threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts.” The Security Council is one of the UN’s principal organs tasked with the maintenance of international peace and security as well as accepting new members to the United Nations and approving any changes to the international body’s Charter."

Crowds pay tribute to Melbourne terror victim	"MELBOURNE, Nov 10 — Hollywood superstar Russell Crowe led tributes today to “true gentleman” 74-year-old Sisto Malaspina, a doyen of Melbourne’s thriving cafe culture who was stabbed to death in Friday’s rush hour terror attack. As crowds gathered at Malaspina’s “Pellegrini” cafe to lay flowers and tokens of remembrance, Australian acting legend Crowe led a flood of tributes online. “Il mio cuore si spezza” (my heart is broken) he wrote on Twitter in Malaspina’s native Italian. “I’ve been going to Pellegrini’s since 1987. Never been to Melbourne without dropping in on my man Sisto... My sweet loyal friend, stabbed in the street by a mad man.” Melbourne is Australia’s second largest city, a thriving cosmopolitan metropolis of almost five million people famed for its cafes, bars, restaurants and high standard of living. Opposition leader Bill Shorten, who is from the city and has been visiting Malaspina’s cafe since his schoolboy days, described the murder of Melbourne’s adopted son as “shocking, unreal and heartbreaking.” “I just saw Sisto on Monday morning. He insisted I try a slice of his almond cake. He’s a Melbourne icon and a true gentleman.” Two other men wounded in the attack are still being treated and are expected to make a recovery. It was another foreign-born resident of the city, Somali-born Australian, Hassan Khalif Shire Ali, who carried out the deadly knife rampage. The 30-year-old fled with his family from war-ravaged Somali to Australia as a child in the 1980s. He was killed yesterday afternoon after driving a 4x4 laden with gas cylinders into the city centre and stabbing three passersby before being confronted by members of the public and armed officers who eventually shot him in the chest. Unconfirmed local media reports suggested he may also have had problems with substance abuse and mental health issues. But he was known by intelligence services to hold extremist views and for now the authorities are treating the attack as a terrorist incident. They have questioned around 35 people who saw the daytime attack, which although crude, was said to have been designed to “cause terror and cause maximum casualties” in the heart of Melbourne. Armed officers raided two addresses in the west and northeast of the city, linked to the perpetrator’s family and associates, although there is not thought to be an ongoing threat. Australian authorities now face difficult questions about how Shire Ali, who was known to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation for at least three years, was able to carry out an attack. He had his Australian passport revoked in 2015 amid fears he was trying to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State (IS) group. His brother will go on trial next year on separate terror-related charges — accused of trying to acquire a firearm and kill people in a New Years’ Eve crowd. “The assessment was made that whilst he had radicalised views he didn’t pose a threat to the national security environment,” Ian Mccartney, a federal police counterterrorism official said of Shire Ali. Mccartney described the attack as a “wake up call” even as IS loses territory in Iraq and Syria, where Australian forces are part of a coalition fighting the group. “The circumstances of how he and when he moved from having these radicalised views to carrying out this attack yesterday will be a key focus of the investigation,” Mccartney added. IS — which often claims responsibility for such attacks — said via its propaganda arm that the perpetrator was an “Islamic State fighter and carried out the operation.” It provided no evidence to back its claim. Witness Chris Newport, 60, who also moved to Melbourne decades ago from overseas, described how he had been returning from a job interview when he heard a loud noise and saw a truck on fire, rolling across the tram tracks before a second, louder bang. Police said that Shire Ali’s improvised explosive device was made up of gas cylinders and some form of lighter and “certainly wasn’t sophisticated”. “In a split second everything changes” Newport told AFP, describing Shire Ali manically brandishing a knife. “You can’t imagine someone deciding to do that.” Police struggled for at least a minute to corral the towering man as he lunged, slashed and stabbed wildly at two officers. At least two members of the public stepped in to help police. One man was armed with a cafe chair while another — swiftly dubbed an “Aussie hero” on social media — repeatedly tried to ram the suspect with an empty metal shopping cart. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the country would be unflinching in the fight against “radical, violent... extremist Islam that opposes our very way of life”. Shire Ali “sought to instil fear in our nation. Like those who tried before him, this terrorist failed,” he said. He cited more than a dozen foiled terror plots as evidence that Australians could have faith in their counterterrorism authorities."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Police probe deadly rampage in Belgian city	"LIEGE, Belgium: Belgian police were Wednesday investigating how a gunman known for contacts with Islamist extremists came to launch a brazen suspected terror attack, shooting dead two female officers with their own weapons before killing a bystander. Belgian police are investigating how a gunman known for contacts with Islamist extremists came to launch a suspected terror attack, shooting dead two female officers with their own weapons before killing a bystander The late morning bloodshed shocked the eastern industrial city of Liege when the attacker armed with a knife repeatedly stabbed the two policewomen before using their own firearms to kill them. Police were scrambling to unpick the motives of the attacker identified as Benjamin Herman, a 36-year-old with a decade spent in and out of prison for acts of violence and petty crimes, who was out of jail on leave when he attacked. Amateur footage obtained by AFP showed the gunman shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" (Arabic for ""God is greatest"") as he walked through the Liege streets during the rampage. In another video, the suspect darts out of a school where he had holed up into a short and intense burst of police gunfire, after which the man collapses to the ground. (Video YouTube/The Guardian) Federal prosecutors said they had launched a terror investigation into the incident and would hold a press conference at 10:30 am (0830 GMT) Wednesday, though Interior Minister Jan Jambon urged caution over any extremist angle. ""There are signals that there was radicalisation in the prison but did this radicalisation lead to these actions? There too we can ask ourselves a lot of questions,"" he told RTL radio. Special attention is being given to the gruesome murder of an alleged heroin dealer linked to Herman who was bludgeoned to death with a hammer late Monday near the Luxembourg border. Investigators on Tuesday found the hammer in Herman's car and Jambon said police believed the Liege attacker carried out the killing just hours after getting temporary release from prison. He ""had nothing to lose"" after ""committing a murder (in the night of Monday to Tuesday),"" a source close to the investigation told AFP. As well as the two policewomen, the attacker also shot dead a 22-year-old student sitting in a parked car in central Liege. He then took a female cleaner hostage in the nearby Leonie de Waha school, a public institution with several hundred students aged from two to 18. The two murdered police officers were identified as Lucile Garcia, 53, who had recently become a grandmother, and Soraya Belkacemi, 45, a mother to 13-year-old twins. Debate in Belgium was swirling on the country's prison policy with reports that Herman had repeatedly blown the conditions of his temporary leave from jail ahead of his full release set for 2020. ""I feel responsible because I have responsibility for prisons,"" Belgian Justice Minister Koen Geens told RTBF radio. Liege, a major city in Belgium's blighted rustbelt, was the scene of another bloody shootout in 2011 when a former convict killed six people and wounded more than 120 before turning the gun on himself. Liege police on Tuesday said it was ""clear that the assassin's objective was to attack the police"" and that one of the four officers wounded had suffered a serious leg injury. Prime Minister Charles Michel denounced what he called the ""cowardly and blind violence"" of Tuesday's attack. - Terror alert - Belgium has been on alert since authorities in January 2015 smashed a terror cell in the town of Verviers near Liege that was planning an attack on police. The cell also had links to Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the mastermind of the November 2015 Islamic State attacks on Paris that killed 130 people. Belgium further raised its terror alert level after the Paris attack and placed the capital Brussels on lockdown for a week. IS suicide attacks then targeted Brussels airport and a metro station, leaving 32 people dead in March 2016. In August that same year, a machete-wielding man shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" attacked two policewomen in the industrial town of Charleroi before being shot dead. The country's law enforcement agencies and intelligence services came under intense scrutiny for apparently missing a series of leads after the Paris attacks that could have led to the Brussels bombers.

"Police have arrested 389 over IS-linked activities since 2013, IGP says"	"KUALA LUMPUR, March 25 — The police have arrested 389 people suspected to have been involved in IS-related activities since 2013, including six Malaysians arrested recently for allegedly planning to attack non-Muslim houses of worship and abduct and kill policemen. Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Mohamed Fuzi Harun said today the arrests resulted from close monitoring and security intelligence. The latest to be arrested were six Malaysians, on Feb 27 this year, and a Filipino national, on March 15, he said when addressing the 211th Police Day parade at the Police Training Centre here. “The Malaysian suspects were allegedly planning to launch attacks on non-Muslim houses of worship and abduct and kill policemen. The Filipino national is wanted by the Philippine authorities for having been involved in cases of kidnapping for ransom and several murder attempts,” he said. Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, Chief Secretary to the Government Tan Sri Ali Hamsa and Home Ministry secretary-general Datuk Seri Alwi Ibrahim were also present at the event. Mohamad Fuzi said the police force had maintained excellence, helping to reduce the crime index by 13,186 cases or 11.7 per cent last year compared to 2016. “Violent crimes dropped by 960 cases of 4.3 per cent and property crimes by 12,226 cases or 13.6 per cent. “Based on the threshold set, the crime index showed a drop of 9.7 per cent from January to March 15 this year while violent crimes dropped by 16.2 per cent and property crimes by 7.9 per cent, he said. Mohamad Fuzi said that though the crime index had dropped, the fear-of-crime phenomenon continued to grip the people, and the police would hold more police-community programmes. On the preparations for the coming general election, he said the police force was at the highest level of readiness, having drawn up strategic programmes since last year. “This includes the initiative of the Bukit Aman Internal Security and Public Order Department in conducting GE14 simulation exercises throughout the country,” he said. On the Eastern Sabah Security Zone (ESSZone), Mohamad Fuzi said the level of security was at the maximum there in the face of the still-active threat of abductions for ransom by the Abu Sayyaf and other militant groups. “Alhamdulillah (Praise be to God), no Malaysians became the victims of abduction in the ESSZone waters last year,” he said. — Bernama"	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Indonesia church attacks kill six, dozens wounded"	"Three separate locations in the city of Surabaya were hit by the bombings around 7:30 am (0030 GMT), which left at least 35 injured. No one has yet claimed responsibility. Images from one scene showed a body lying outside the gate of Santa Maria catholic church and members of Indonesia's bomb squad poring over the rubble. ""Six people are dead and 35 are in hospital,"" East Java Police spokesman Frans Barung Mangera said, adding that two police officers were among the injured. At least one of the attackers was killed when they detonated their bomb at Santa Maria. It was not clear if any other perpetrators were killed or injured. The attacks come several days after five Indonesian police officers and an inmate were killed in clashes at a high-security jail on the outskirts of Jakarta. AFP / JUNI KRISWANTOExtremists have mounted a series of attacks against Christians and other minorities in recent years The Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility for that incident although police rejected its involvement. The Southeast Asian nation's 260 million people includes significant numbers of Christians, Hindus and Buddhists but there are concerns over rising intolerance. Indonesian police shot and wounded a man who attacked a church congregation in the town of Sleman with a sword during a Sunday mass in February. The radical Islamist, who had wanted to fight with the Islamic State group in Syria, injured four people. Indonesia, which will begin the holy fasting month Ramadan this week, has been on high alert after a string of recent plots and attacks by militants inspired by IS. The archipelago nation of some 17,000 islands has long struggled with Islamic militancy and has suffered a series of attacks in the past 15 years -- including the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people, mostly foreign tourists, in the country's worst-ever terror attack. A sustained crackdown weakened the most dangerous networks but the emergence of IS has proved a potent new rallying cry for radicals. Hundreds of Indonesians have flocked to fight with IS, sparking fears that extremist outfits could get a new lease on life. A gun and suicide attack in the capital Jakarta left four attackers and four civilians dead in January 2016, and was the first assault claimed by IS in Southeast Asia. The attack on a district packed with malls, embassies and United Nations offices left around 20 others injured. Previous incidents have included a 2004 suicide car bomb that killed 10 outside the Australian embassy in Jakarta, twin bomb blasts that killed 22 in a market in the Central Sulawesi town of Tentena, and a suicide bombing in 2005 that left 20 dead in Bali. Seven people were killed, six of them foreigners, and more than 40 were injured when suicide bombers targeted the luxury Ritz-Carlton and JW Marriott hotels in Jakarta in July 2009."

Malaysia police hunt for four ISIS militants still on the run	"Malaysia's police chief Mohamad Fuzi Harun said in a statement on Monday (April 16) that six members of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) cell were arrested between Feb 27 and March 1. But four others were still on the run. Police said the men were ""dangerous"" and ""capable of launching attacks that could pose a threat to national security"". Clockwise from top left: The suspects listed were named as Muhamad Faizal Muhamad Hanafi, Muhamad Hanafi Yah, both of whom are from Kelantan state, Awae Wae-Eya, a Thai national living in southern Thailand and Nor Farkhan Mohd Isa, whose address was given as being in southern Johor. (Courtesy of Royal Malaysian Police/-) Two of the suspects listed were named as Muhamad Faizal Muhamad Hanafi and Muhamad Hanafi Yah, both from Kelantan state. A third suspect is Nor Farkhan Mohd Isa, whose address was given as being in Taman Ungku Tun Aminah in Skudai, southern Johor. The fourth suspect is Awae Wae-Eya, a Thai national living in Narathiwat province in southern Thailand. ""We have been monitoring the cells for the last few months. We are asking the public to share with us if they have any information on the whereabouts of these four suspects. They should approach the police if they know anything,"" Bukit Aman Special Branch's Counter Terrorism chief Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay told The Straits Times. Intelligence sources say they believe Awae is the group's mastermind, based on interrogation of the six men arrested, and that he is trying to establish an ISIS cell in southern Thailand. The arrests of the other members of the terror cell, which included two men working as janitors in Singapore, were previously announced on March 24. The plot was uncovered after Malaysian counter-terrorism police, aided by their Singaporean counterparts, detained the terrorists in a series of swoops. The order to kidnap and kill policemen was the first of its kind, according to an intelligence source. The six men who were nabbed earlier included a 37-year-old technician who was initially thought to have masterminded the plans to attack places of worship in Johor Baru. The second suspect, a 49-year-old security guard, was the cell's adviser and responsible for keeping the cell and its plans secret. Also picked up during the raids was a 30-year-old security guard, who was tasked with acquiring firearms from a neighbouring country and scouting for non-Muslim houses of worship to target. Another suspect, a 25-year-old waiter, had been ordered to kidnap and kill policemen. Two others, aged 23 and 22, were arrested on March 1 and worked as janitors in Singapore. One of them acted as the intermediary in the purchase of firearms for the cell, while the other was picked up to facilitate police investigations. A member of the Abu Sayyaf group in the Philippines was also arrested during the police crackdown, in Sabah, on March 15. The 31-year-old man is said to be a trusted lieutenant to Furuji Indama, the group's leader based in Basilan. Believed to have connections to Malaysian militant Mahmud Ahmad, he is also wanted by Philippines authorities for involvement in a kidnap-for-ransom syndicate. He is an expert in making improvised explosive devices and had planned to attack several locations in Sabah. Malaysia has arrested nearly 400 people since 2013 for suspected links to terrorism. The Muslim-majority nation faces threats from self-radicalised ISIS sympathisers at home, and regional militant groups which seek funding and refuge in South-east Asia. Malaysia's only terrorist attack took place in June 2016, when two men on a motorcycle lobbed a grenade into a nightclub in Selangor, injuring eight people. The men were sentenced to 25 years' jail each."	Terrorism	Terrorism
New anti-terror unit boosts SAF	" THE Philippine National Police is set to form additional five battalions of police commandos—a maximum 4,000 men—to enhance the government’s fight against terrorists and all forms of threats to the country’s internal security. PNP chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa said the formation of the five battalions of the Special Action Force was  created solely to combat terrorism and criminality. “After a review of the PNP’s proposal, the Commission approved the creation of five additional SAF to effectively carry out the mandate of the PNP to actively support the Armed Forces in internal security operations for the suppression of insurgency and other serious threats to national security pursuant to Executive Order No. 546, series of 2006,” said Napolcom vice chairman and executive officer Rogelio Casurao. The approval came barely a day after the PNP arrested an Egyptian national suspected to have links with the Islamic State. Meanwhile, the military warned Friday that jihadists were waging a fresh and deadly bid to set up a Southeast Asian caliphate in Mindanao. The gunmen have mustered a force of about 200 fighters and fought a series of skirmishes with the security forces this year after government forces retook Marawi last October, Colonel Romeo Brawner told AFP. “They have not abandoned their objective to create a caliphate in Southeast Asia,” said Brawner, the commander of a Marawi-based military task force. “Mindanao is the most fertile ground,” he said, referring to the country’s southern region. Struggling with widespread poverty and armed Muslim insurgencies seeking independence or self-rule, Mindanao must improve poor supervision of Islamic schools or madrasas where most young gunmen are recruited, Brawner added. He said the armed forces are retooling to meet the challenge of the Maute group, which occupied Marawi over five months and has pledged allegiance to the Middle East-based Islamic State group.Gunmen who escaped during the early days of the US-backed operation to recapture Marawi are leading the recruitment effort, flush with cash, guns and jewellery looted from the city’s banks and private homes, Brawner said. The recruits are mostly locals, but an unspecified number of Indonesians, some with bomb-making skills, have recently arrived there, he said. Mindanao military officials said the Maute gunmen murdered three traders in the town of Piagapo, near Marawi, in November last year. Three jihadists were killed in Pantar, another neighboring town, on Feb. 8, while three of the Piagapo merchants’ suspected killers were arrested in that town last month. The military also reported skirmishes with the Maute gunmen in the towns of Masiu and Pagayawan near Marawi last month. The renewed fighting came after President Duterte and other political leaders in the Mindanao region warned of a potential repeat of the siege of Marawi which claimed more than 1,100 lives. Duterte imposed martial law over Mindanao until the end of the year to curb the militants’ challenge. Ebrahim Murad, head of the Philippines’ main Muslim rebel group the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which signed a peace treaty with Manila in 2014, also warned Tuesday that jihadists were recruiting and could seize another Filipino city.

Former Al-Qaeda man among five terror suspects nabbed by Malaysian police	"KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysia arrested five terror suspects in October, including a former Al-Qaeda operative who had dealings with the Afghanistan-based terror group's slain leader Osama bin Laden. National police chief Mohamad Fuzi Harun said on Wednesday (Oct 31) the five included two Malaysians, a Pakistani, an Egyptian and a Middle Eastern man.They were detained in Selangor, Perak, Kuala Lumpur and Sabah by counter-terrorism officers during the operation from Oct 13 to Oct 26. The two Malaysians - a man and a woman - had channelled funds to their compatriot Muhammad Wanndy Mohamed Jedi, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) recruiter killed in a drone strike in Raqqa last year. The 32-year-old woman arrested in Kuala Lumpur on Oct 25 had moved money to Wanndy between 2014 and 2017. A 40-year-old service manager from Sabah was held on Oct 26, also for channelling funds to Wanndy and the latter's would-be successor Muhamad Fudhail Omar, who was also killed in Syria last year. He is also alleged to have helped fund the Filipino militant group Abu Sayyaf since 2015. Abu Sayyaf is notorious for demanding ransom after abducting people off the coast of Sabah, which faces the southern Philippines. Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi said the Egyptian suspect had worked in Kuala Lumpur. ""The first suspect is a 50-year-old Egyptian working as an executive manager in a Kuala Lumpur firm, and was detained in Selangor on Oct 13, 2018. The suspect was a former Al-Qaeda member while in Afghanistan from 1988 to 1993. He had met with Osama bin Laden,"" he said. The Egyptian had used fake travel documents to enter Canada, Azerbaijan and Pakistan and has been previously arrested in Canada and Egypt for the same offence. According to Inspector-General Mohamad Fuzi, the other two foreigners were apprehended on Oct 20 and Oct 25, respectively. A 31-year-old Middle Eastern was intercepted at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. ""He had issued a death threat against a foreign diplomat in Kuala Lumpur and is suspected (of) involvement in terrorism,"" the police chief said. The Pakistani, a 31-year-old labourer, was taken into custody in the town of Sitiawan, Perak, after police discovered his involvement in Lashkar-e-Taiba, one of the largest and most active Islamic terror groups in South Asia, mainly operating in Pakistan. The trained militant has been in Malaysia since 2016. Malaysia has arrested more than 420 terror suspects since 2013, and foiled plots largely to launch attacks locally. The country's first and only terrorist attack took place in June 2016, when two men on a motorcycle lobbed a grenade into a nightclub in Selangor, injuring eight people. The men were sentenced to 25 years' jail."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"After counter-terror swoop in state, mufti says Perlis not hotbed of extremism"	"AMMAN, Jordan, Oct 6 — Students intending to pursue their studies at religious learning centres in Perlis as well as teachers who want to work there must undergo security screening and be declared ‘clean’ by police. Perlis mufti Prof Madya Dr Mohd Asri Zainul Abidin said the state police chief SAC Noor Mushar Mohamad himself had been appointed a member of the state Islamic Religious Council Committee. “I always ask the state police chief about the students at these learning centres, especially the foreigners. Only with police confirmation will we allow them (to pursue studies at the religious learning centres),” he told Bernama here today. He was commenting on the arrests of eight men including seven foreigners by the Bukit Aman Special Branch Counter Terrorism Division following an operation in Perlis, Kuala Lumpur and Johor on September 24 for suspected involvement in activities that were detrimental to security and public order. Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi Harun was reported as saying on October 6 that all of the suspects were involved with an Islamic learning centre in Perlis, believed to be promoting extremist teachings. Mohd Asri stressed that the arrests of the eight individuals did not mean that Perlis was the centre for the spreading of radical teachings. “We have nothing to do with the issue as the people of Perlis are adopting the values of moderation. “I want the police to conduct a transparent investigation as the heads of these centres have given their assurance that they will take action if there is a spread of radicalism or terrorism in their institutions,” he said. Mohd Asri is accompanying the Raja Muda of Perlis Tuanku Syed Faizuddin Putra Jamalullail who is currently on a working visit to Jordan."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Counter-terror police nab eight over radicalisation plans	" KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 6 — The federal police’s counter-terrorism division arrested seven foreigners and one Malaysian late last month on suspicion of planning to destabilise the local democracy and spreading religious extremism. According to Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Mohd Fuzi Harun, early investigations showed the suspects planned to instill views that trousers, tertiary education in non-religious institutions, and workplaces without gender segregation to all be haram or forbidden in Islam. “Preliminary investigations by police and shared information with foreign intelligence agencies revealed that the foreigners have links to a madrasah in Dammaj, Yemen that was founded by Syeikh Muqbil Hadi Al Wadi’i, an extremist Salafi jihadist. “The madrasah in Yemen is a stronghold of the Salafi jihadist ideology that permits the killing of non-Muslims as well as Muslims not aligned with them and consequently deemed unbelievers; it also labelled democracy as Thoghut (against Allah’s law),” he said in a statement. Of the group arrested, the IGP said six foreigners — one from the Americas and five from Europe — were picked up from a religious centre in Perlis. One suspect is believed to have undergone weapons training in Yemen, but all are believed to be linked to the Islamic State group. A Middle Easterner was also arrested in Kuala Lumpur, also at a religious centre where he is believed to have been spreading extremist ideology to Klang Valley residents. The Malaysian was detained in Muar, Johor, where he worked  as a trader. The suspect is an alumni of the religious school in Perlis where the six above were arrested. All the arrests were made on September 24. “This is not the first time foreign Salafi jihadist elements have used Malaysia as a launchpad to spread the ideology and recruit new members. “The modus operandi was used by Abdullah Sungkar and Abu Bakar Bashir, leaders of the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist group to infiltrate Malaysia in 1985 and form Islamic centres in Negri Sembilan and Johor to spread the ideology,” Mohd Fuzi said. The eight were arrested for terrorism-related offences under the Penal Code and being held with the invocation of the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Woman held for attempted murder in British knife attack	"BARNSLEY, United Kingdom (AFP) - British police arrested a woman for attempted murder on Saturday (Sept 8) after reports that she chased a man through a shopping district with a large knife before stabbing him. ""A 28-year-old woman arrested this morning on suspicion of attempted murder remains in police custody,"" police said after the incident in the northern English city of Barnsley. ""The woman is currently being assessed from a mental health perspective."" One man suffered minor injuries in the attack. Britain is on high alert after a string of deadly terror attacks, many involving knives, and the incident raised fears of terrorism. Assistant Chief Constable Tim Forbes of South Yorkshire Police earlier said officers were ""keeping an open mind as to the motivation"". He said his force was ""receiving support"" from a local counter-terrorism unit. Market stall holder Terry Ellis told AFP he saw a woman with a ""big knife"", measuring about 30cm running after a man and shouting ""kill, kill, kill"". Another trader, Abdul Razak, added: ""This lady followed this man saying I'll kill you, I'll kill you."" Other local traders said the stabbing, initially declared by police as a ""serious incident"", caused the covered market and other parts of the town centre to be ""locked down"". Police were alerted at around 8.20am (3.20pm Singapore time), and recovered a kitchen knife at the scene. Forbes called on any witnesses to come forward, but urged locals to remain calm. ""We understand that this morning's incident will have been distressing and shocking for those in the town centre and wider Barnsley communities,"" he said. ""Rest assured we are working relentlessly to piece together what happened."" Several crime scenes have been established and police said they would stay in the area until there was more clarity about what happened. Earlier the Facebook page of Barnsley Mayday Green Market reported that ""this market and most of the town centre is in lockdown"", before later declaring it had received the all-clear."

British police arrested a woman today after she chased a man through a shopping district with a large knife before stabbing him, in an incident that raised fears of terrorism. “One woman has been arrested and remains in police custody following reports of a stabbing in Barnsley town centre” in northern England, South Yorkshire Police said in a statement. “One man suffered minor injuries. No other injuries have been reported at this time.” Assistant Chief Constable Tim Forber said officers were “keeping an open mind as to the motivation”, adding that they were “receiving support” from a local counter-terrorism unit. Market stall holder Terry Ellis told AFP he saw a woman with a “big knife, (measuring) about 12 inches” (30.5cm) running after a man and shouting “kill, kill, kill”. Another trader, Abdul Razak, added: “This lady followed this man saying I’ll kill you, I’ll kill you.” Other local traders said the stabbing, initially declared by police as a “serious incident”, caused the covered market and other parts of the town centre to be “locked down”. Britain is on high alert after a string of deadly terror attacks, many involving knives. Police were alerted at around 8.20am (0720 GMT) to reports of a woman with a knife in the town centre. “A kitchen knife has been recovered by officers and is being forensically examined,” Forber said. He called on any witnesses to come forward, but urged locals to remain calm. “We understand that this morning’s incident will have been distressing and shocking for those in the town centre and wider Barnsley communities,” he said. “Rest assured we are working relentlessly to piece together what happened.” Several crime scenes have been established and police said they would stay in the area until there was more clarity about what happened. Earlier the Facebook page of Barnsley Mayday Green Market reported that “this market and most of the town centre is in lockdown”, before later declaring it had received the all-clear.

German police arrest Russian over alleged jihadist bomb plot	"BERLIN, Aug 22 — German police commandos today arrested a Russian suspected Islamist militant accused of having plotted an explosives attack in the country. Identified only as 31-year-old Magomed-Ali C., he was allegedly an accomplice of Clement Baur, who was arrested in Marseilles shortly before the 2017 French elections accused of plotting an imminent attack. The Russian man “is suspected of having plotted, together with Clement B., detained in France, a serious act of violence against the state,” German federal prosecutors said in a statement. Commandos of the elite police unit GSG 9 stormed the man’s Berlin apartment in an operation which prosecutors said was linked to the Baur case. Baur and another suspect, who had both pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group, were arrested in April 2017 in a Marseilles apartment. French police found an IS flag, a loaded Uzi sub-machine gun, two pistols, a homemade grenade and TATP, a volatile explosive dubbed “mother of Satan”. The German prosecutors said that Magomed-Ali C. and Baur had also planned an explosives attack “at an unknown location in Germany, meant to maim or kill the greatest possible number of people”. For this purpose, Magomed-Ali C. had kept in his Berlin flat “a substantial amount” of TATP since at least October 2016. Those attack plans were foiled however by an unspecified German “preventive police operation”, which led the accomplices to split up and Baur to travel to France, said the prosecutors.

UK police rush to solve Novichok nerve agent death	" LONDON, July 9 — British police rushed to solve a murder mystery today after a woman died following exposure to the nerve agent Novichok, four months after the same toxin was used against a former Russian spy in an attack that Britain blamed on Moscow. Prime Minister Theresa May said she was “appalled and shocked” by the death of Dawn Sturgess, a 44-year-old mother of three who had been living in a homeless hostel in the city of Salisbury in southwest England. Sturgess and Charlie Rowley, 45, fell ill last weekend in the town of Amesbury, near Salisbury, the city where former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were attacked with the Novichok nerve agent in March and have since recovered. Local MP John Glen said the local community was “anxious” after police opened a murder inquiry, although health officials have said the danger to the general public is low. Glen told BBC radio the two may have handled a contaminated object because of their “habit of looking into bins” and police were trying to work out “how they came into contact with this nerve agent and when”. Britain and its allies accused Russia of trying to kill the Skripals, prompting angry denials and sparking an international diplomatic crisis. Police said they would be led by the evidence but confirmed a link between the Amesbury case and the Salisbury attack was a main line of inquiry. Interior minister Sajid Javid last week demanded answers from Moscow, saying he would not accept Britain becoming a “dumping ground for poison”. Police said the British couple were believed to have become exposed to Novichok by handling a “contaminated item”, with speculation that it could have been the container used to administer the nerve agent to the Skripals. However, police and public health officials insist the risk to the wider public remains low. A police officer was tested for possible exposure to the deadly nerve agent over the weekend but was given the all-clear. Christine Blanshard, medical director at Salisbury District Hospital, where Sturgess and Rowley were being treated and where the Skripals were hospitalised, told the Daily Telegraph that staff had “worked tirelessly to save Dawn”. “Our staff are talented, dedicated and professional and I know today they will be hurting today,” she said. The prime minister said: “Police and security officials are working urgently to establish the facts of this incident, which is now being investigated as a murder.” Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the head of Britain’s counter-terror police, said Sturgess’s death “has only served to strengthen our resolve to identify and bring to justice the person or persons responsible for what I can only describe as an outrageous, reckless and barbaric act”. He added that the other victim “remains critically ill in hospital and our thoughts are with him and his family as well”. Residents of the homeless hostel in Salisbury where Sturgess lived, which was evacuated after the couple fell ill, expressed their devastation at the news of her death. “It could easily have happened to anyone, to me or my partner,” 27-year-old Ben Jordan told AFP late Sunday. “We are really, really sad. I am praying for Charlie.” Around 100 counter-terrorism officers are helping in the investigation, which police said Friday could take “weeks and months”. So far, there is no evidence that the couple visited any of the sites involved in the Skripal case. “Detectives will continue with their painstaking and meticulous work to gather all the available evidence so that we can understand how two citizens came to be exposed with such a deadly substance that tragically cost Dawn her life,” Basu said. Sturgess collapsed on the morning of June 30 and was taken to hospital. That afternoon, Rowley fell ill at the same address in Amesbury and was also hospitalised. It was not until the Wednesday, however, that the government’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down confirmed their exposure to Novichok. “Detectives are working as quickly and as diligently as possible to identify the source of the contamination, but this has not been established at this time,” police said on Sunday. “We are not in a position to say whether the nerve agent was from the same batch that the Skripals were exposed to.” The Skripals were released from hospital but the investigation into the attack on them continues. No arrests have been made."	Terrorism	Terrorism
 UK marks anniversary of London mosque terror attack	"LONDON, July 20 — Britain yesterday marked the first anniversary of a deadly terror attack against a north London mosque, with Prime Minister Theresa May vowing that “vile extremism” will not divide the nation. Mourners held a minute’s silence at 9.30am to remember father-of-six Makram Ali, who died when Darren Osbourne ploughed a hire van onto a crowded pavement close to Finsbury Park mosque, intending to kill as many Muslims as possible. The attack, on June 19 last year, also left 12 injured. Home Secretary Sajid Javid, London Mayor Sadiq Khan and opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn all attended the event at nearby Islington Town Hall, along with the imam of the mosque, Mohammed Mahmoud. “A man ridden with racism drove a vehicle into a crowd of people and tried to divide and destroy our community,” said Corbyn. “We will never allow them to destroy us. Stay united, stay together, support each other!”, he added. Osbourne, 48, left a note in the van, in which he said he was seeking revenge for Islamist terror attacks and a child sex scandal, and named mayor Khan as someone that he also wanted to kill. The mayor paid tribute to the response of the local community. “The way this community has responded has inspired us all,” he said. “When Londoners face adversity we stand up for our values. This is our city, this is our way of life. For those who seek to divide us, the message is ‘you will never succeed’.” Osbourne, from the Welsh capital Cardiff, was in February sentenced to life in prison with a minimum 43-year term. “Last year’s cowardly attack which targeted innocent worshippers leaving Finsbury Park mosque is an attack on all of us,” May said in a statement. “As with all acts of terrorism the intention was to divide us but we will not let this happen. “We are a country of many faiths and freedom of worship and respect for those of different faiths is fundamental to this country’s values and these values will never be broken by vile extremism,” she added. When passing sentence at a London court, judge Bobbie Cheema-Grubb said that Osbourne had been “rapidly radicalised” and that his “mindset became one of malevolent hatred”. “In short you allowed your mind to be poisoned by those who claimed to be leaders.” Osbourne became radicalised over a month last year after watching a television programme about a child sex ring scandal involving a gang of mainly Muslim men in northern England. Nigel Bromage, a former leader of a neo-Nazi group who later turned anti far-right campaigner, called the attack “a sobering reminder that the threat from far-right extremism is no different from the Islamist threat. “Both share a common desire to spread fear and divide society, ultimately two sides of the same coin,” he added. Witnesses recalled Osbourne saying: “I’ve done my job, you can kill me now” and “at least I had a proper go” in the immediate aftermath of the attack. The handwritten note found in the van read: “Why are their terrorists on our streets today? “Islam’s ideology doesn’t belong here and neither does sharia law.” The Manchester suicide bombing in May 2017 and the London Bridge van attack and stabbing rampage in June that year further fuelled his obsession, the court was told."

Officer praised for saving young girl in attack on Surabaya Police	"Sr. Adj. Comr. Roni Faisal Saiful Fatoni is the head of Surabaya Police’s narcotics division. Recently, however, he has received an avalanche of praise from across the country, not for taking down drug dealers, but for rescuing a child from the smoldering wreckage of a bomb detonated by her own parents – a bomb that was meant to kill him and his colleagues. On Monday morning, Roni and several other police officers were on standby at their office trying to make sense of a spate of terror attacks that had struck the city the day before. The Surabaya Police were aware that they could very well be the terrorists’ next target, so heavier security was placed around their headquarters. Their instincts may have saved the lives of many police officers, as that Monday morning, five people on two motorcycles approached the headquarters’ main entrance at high speed. Mere seconds after stopping at the security gates, as ordered by officers, the bombs strapped to their bodies went off, throwing nearby personnel to the ground. Four people on the motorcycles were killed instantly, but an 8-year-old girl – the daughter of the perpetrators – survived. Amid the panic, with flames and smoke still billowing from the site of the explosion, the young girl could be seen rising unsteadily to her feet. She tried to move away from the ruins but was unable to walk due to her injuries. Without knowing whether a second bomb was set to go off or, worse, whether the child had explosives strapped to her body, Roni rushed toward the girl and scooped her up in his arms to take her to safety. ""I have a daughter exactly her age. My immediate instinct was to save this little girl,"" Roni said in a recent interview with Kompas.TV. Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, East Java Police chief Insp. Gen. Machfud Arifin said: “If there had been a bomb tied to the child’s belly, I would have lost my narcotics division head.” Footage of Roni’s daring move quickly made the rounds on TV news outlets as well as social media platforms. Netizens responded by praising his actions as “heroic”, with many lauding him for saving the child without hesitation and at the risk of his own life. Praise was also directed at the National Police for their swift actions in handling the terrorist threats when they themselves had become a target. ""Feeling touched. Thanks Pak Roni for saving her,"" @Anaa said on Twitter. Flower boards with messages supporting the police can still be seen around the East Java Police headquarters. ""We support the police in keeping NKRI [the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia] safe,"" one message reads."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Indonesia church attacks kill six, dozens wounded"	"SURABAYA, Indonesia: A wave of blasts including a suicide bombing struck outside churches in Indonesia on Sunday, killing at least six and wounding dozens of others, police said, the latest assault on a religious minority in the world's biggest Muslim-majority country. The deadly blasts all occurred within 10 minutes of each other, police said Three separate locations in the city of Surabaya were hit by the bombings around 7:30 am (0030 GMT), which left at least 35 injured. No one has yet claimed responsibility. Images from one scene showed a body lying outside the gate of Santa Maria catholic church and members of Indonesia's bomb squad poring over the rubble. ""Six people are dead and 35 are in hospital,"" East Java Police spokesman Frans Barung Mangera said, adding that two police officers were among the injured. At least one of the attackers was killed when they detonated their bomb at Santa Maria. It was not clear if any other perpetrators were killed or injured. The attacks come several days after five Indonesian police officers and an inmate were killed in clashes at a high-security jail on the outskirts of Jakarta. The Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility for that incident although police rejected its involvement. The Southeast Asian nation's 260 million people includes significant numbers of Christians, Hindus and Buddhists but there are concerns over rising intolerance. Indonesian police shot and wounded a man who attacked a church congregation in the town of Sleman with a sword during a Sunday mass in February. The radical Islamist, who had wanted to fight with the Islamic State group in Syria, injured four people. - High alert - Indonesia, which will begin the holy fasting month Ramadan this week, has been on high alert after a string of recent plots and attacks by militants inspired by IS. The archipelago nation of some 17,000 islands has long struggled with Islamic militancy and has suffered a series of attacks in the past 15 years -- including the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people, mostly foreign tourists, in the country's worst-ever terror attack. A sustained crackdown weakened the most dangerous networks but the emergence of IS has proved a potent new rallying cry for radicals. Hundreds of Indonesians have flocked to fight with IS, sparking fears that extremist outfits could get a new lease on life. A gun and suicide attack in the capital Jakarta left four attackers and four civilians dead in January 2016, and was the first assault claimed by IS in Southeast Asia. The attack on a district packed with malls, embassies and United Nations offices left around 20 others injured. Previous incidents have included a 2004 suicide car bomb that killed 10 outside the Australian embassy in Jakarta, twin bomb blasts that killed 22 in a market in the Central Sulawesi town of Tentena, and a suicide bombing in 2005 that left 20 dead in Bali. Seven people were killed, six of them foreigners, and more than 40 were injured when suicide bombers targeted the luxury Ritz-Carlton and JW Marriott hotels in Jakarta in July 2009."

Malaysian police hunting for four suspected ISIS militants	"Malaysian police are hunting for four militants suspected of planning attacks on non-Muslim places of worship, as well as plotting to kidnap and murder police officers. Police chief Mohamad Fuzi Harun said in a statement yesterday that six members of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) cell were arrested between Feb 27 and March 1. But four others were still on the run. Police said the men were ""dangerous"" and ""capable of launching attacks that could pose a threat to national security"". Two of the suspects listed were named as Muhamad Faizal Muhamad Hanafi and Muhamad Hanafi Yah, both from Kelantan. A third suspect is Nor Farkhan Mohd Isa, whose address was given as being in Taman Ungku Tun Aminah in Skudai, southern Johor. The fourth is Awae Wae-Eya, a Thai national living in Narathiwat province in southern Thailand. ""We have been monitoring the cells for the last few months. We are asking the public to share with us if they have any information on the whereabouts of these four suspects. They should approach the police if they know anything,"" the Special Branch's Counter Terrorism chief Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay told The Straits Times. Intelligence sources say they believe Awae is the group's mastermind, based on interrogation of the six men arrested, and that he is trying to establish an ISIS cell in southern Thailand. From left: Terror suspects Awae Wae-Eya, Muhamad Hanafi Yah, Nor Farkhan Mohd Isa and Muhamad Faizal Muhamad Hanafi are still at large. The arrests of the other members of the terror cell, which included two men working as janitors in Singapore, were previously announced on March 24. The plot was uncovered after Malaysian counter-terrorism police, aided by their Singaporean counterparts, detained the terrorists in a series of swoops. The order to kidnap and kill policemen was the first of its kind, according to an intelligence source. The six men nabbed earlier included a 37-year-old technician who was initially thought to have masterminded the plans to attack places of worship in Johor Baru. The second suspect, a 49-year-old security guard, was the cell's adviser and responsible for keeping the cell and its plans secret. Also picked up during the raids was a 30-year old security guard, tasked with acquiring firearms from a neighbouring country and scouting for non-Muslim houses of worship to target. Another suspect, a 25-year-old waiter, had been ordered to kidnap and kill policemen. Two others, aged 23 and 22, were arrested on March 1 and worked as janitors in Singapore. One of them acted as an intermediary to buy firearms. The other was picked up to facilitate police investigations. A member of the Abu Sayyaf group in the Philippines was also arrested during the police crackdown in Sabah on March 15. The 31-year-old man is said to be a trusted lieutenant to Furuji Indama, the group's leader based in Basilan and believed to have connections to Malaysian militant Mahmud Ahmad. He is an expert in making improvised explosive devices and had planned to attack several locations in Sabah. Malaysia has arrested nearly 400 people since 2013 for suspected links to terrorism."

Stopping comms during a terror attack could be a game-changer	"APRIL 4 ? Singapore recently passed the Public Order and Safety (Special Powers) Act (POSSPA), which empowers the police to deal more effectively with evolving and emerging security threats. The new legislation is essentially an update of the Public Order (Preservation) Act. Much interest and debate has been generated over the Communications Stop Order (CSO) provision, which essentially allows the police to prohibit the public in the incident area from “making or communicating films or pictures and text or audio messages about ongoing security operations”. There are safeguards to prevent potential abuse and ensure accountability as the CSO does not “automatically come into force” and must be “specifically unlocked” by the Police Commissioner “as and when deemed necessary” ? but only after the Minister for Home Affairs has activated POSSPA. The CSO aims to deny terrorists access to information, as this could compromise ongoing security operations, and otherwise affect future ones. The Ministry of Home Affairs deemed this critical as getting access to such information could endanger the lives of security personnel and members of the public. One example cited was the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Then, live coverage of ongoing security operations enabled terrorists to anticipate and outmanoeuvre security forces. Another concern is that videos and other media of police operations and tactics, such as their response times and movements, could be studied by those bent on wreaking havoc and be used to plan for future attacks. Apart from operational considerations, the CSO should also be seen broadly as a way to improve risk and crisis management during major security incidents. During any major crises, especially a major security incident like a terror attack, demand for information will expectedly be high. People would want to find out if their loved ones are affected/involved, and if they are, whether they are safe. People directly affected would want to know how to get to safety. Members of the public would also want to help, by providing information they think may be of use to law enforcement officers. There will thus be immense pressure on agencies to put out information quickly. During an unfolding crisis, information may not be available, and even when it does become available, it needs to be verified before being released. When the demand for speedy information is not met, it is natural for some individuals to try and fill the void by pushing out a story or social media post that may be factually inaccurate, or worse, incorrect. As many instances have shown, much of what has been posted by individuals, well-meaning or otherwise, has not been verified. Since smartphones allow individuals to be both information creators and broadcasters, misinformation will inevitably be generated and widely disseminated. Putting out such misinformation can adversely impact the management of an ongoing crisis. First, it could spark smaller crises that would require division of resources and distract officers from dealing with the main incident. A 2011 United States Congressional Research Service report titled Social Media and Disasters: Current Uses, Future Options, and Policy Considerations, warned: “Some individuals or organisations might intentionally provide inaccurate information to confuse, disrupt, or otherwise thwart response efforts One tactic that has been used by terrorists involves the use of a secondary attack after an initial attack to kill and injure first responders. Social media could be used as a tool for such purposes by issuing calls for assistance to an area, or notifying officials of a false hazard or threat that requires a response”. Second, it could create crises that are not easily resolved, such as undermining social cohesion. In December, for instance, rumours circulated via social media that London’s West End was the target of a terror attack, leading to a major stampede as people panicked and attempted to flee the area. Law enforcement was also activated and deployed as there were reports of gunshots. Investigations later revealed that an altercation between two men had actually sparked off the chaos. In this scenario, adversaries could have easily exploited both the bedlam and the fact that law enforcement was preoccupied with dealing with the crises to carry out attacks in other locations. In 2013, a Brown University student, Sunil Tripathi, was misidentified as one of the Boston Marathon bombers. This resulted in a manhunt for the wrong individual, as well as the harassment of his family. In 2015, following the Paris attacks, a photo of Veerender Jubbal, a Canadian of Sikh heritage, was doctored and mis-captioned to portray him as one of the terrorists involved. The photo was so convincing that a Spanish newspaper ran the story. Jubbal is still reportedly treated suspiciously even though it was proven that the story was inaccurate and the photo of him was a hoax. Both examples highlight that certain ethnic or religious groups and individuals can become targets of hate on the basis of misinformation. It is unrealistic to think that misinformation generation and dissemination will be eliminated completely in the immediate aftermath of an incident, even with the CSO. Other measures will be required to help manage the risks as well. First, crisis communication gurus often suggest that an official communications channel/source needs to be established to ensure that accurate and regularly updated information is disseminated to the public. The Queensland Police, for instance, became the sole source of information during the 2011 floods, and used their official social media channels to provide information to the public. The Singapore Police Force’s (SPF) official social media channels/pages and apps will be useful in this regard. Second, active “mythbusting’” on SPF’s social media channels will be useful. The public can send information via the [email protected] and SG Secure apps to the SPF, who can then verify and disseminate the correct information. Even without the use of apps, any information provided by the public that is helpful to the investigations would certainly be welcomed. The bottomline is that it is imperative that any information being disseminated is accurate. The CSO enables Singapore to take a pre-emptive approach to managing risks and crises that could develop as a result of misinformation generation and dissemination, immediately following a major security crisis. This is crucial in an age of deliberate online falsehoods"	Terrorism	Terrorism
 Malaysia charges three with attempting to carry out terror attack in Johor	"JOHOR BARU (THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - A court in the Malaysian state of Johor on Monday (March 26) charged three men for attempting to carry out acts of terror in the city centre and possessing terror-related materials. Nik Muhamad Zaini Nik Hassan, 37, and Ismadi Mohd Nor, also known as Ismail, 30, were both charged at the Sessions court in Johor Baru before Judge Kamarudin Kamsun. They were alleged to have intended to attack a government building along Jalan Abu Bakar in Johor Baru. The road is located not far from the state's largest hospital and near the main square. The duo had been planning their attack at a restaurant in Johor Baru between Dec 11, 2017, and Jan 31 earlier this year. The two face a prison sentence of not more than seven years and are liable for a fine upon conviction. In another case, a security guard was also charged at the same court for possessing videos relating to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terror group. Mohd Zaki Ibrahim, 49, was alleged to have stored the videos inside two Samsung mobile phones at a substation guard post located at the Bandar Baru Permas Jaya suburb of Johor Baru at around 12.30pm on Feb 27. The charge is under paragraph 130JB(1)(a) of the Penal Code (Act 574). If found guilty, he can be sentenced under Subsection 130JB(1) of the same Act, which carries a maximum seven years' jail and a fine. No plea was recorded from all three suspects, who were not represented by lawyers. Judge Kamarudin has set April 26 for the case to be mentioned again."	Terrorism	Terrorism

 Three killed in terror attack in France	"TREBES (France) • Three people were killed in a terrorist attack in France yesterday when a gunman held up a car, opened fire on police and then took hostages in a supermarket, screaming ""Allahu Akbar"". The gunman first hijacked a car, killing one person and wounding another. He then fired on police officers in Carcassonne, wounding an officer in the shoulder before heading to Trebes about 8km to the east, where two more people were killed at the Super-U supermarket. Police later stormed the supermarket in the small south-western town of Trebes. Interior Minister Gerard Collomb later said on Twitter that the attacker had been killed. Two police officers were hurt in the operation, a source said. Mr Collomb named the gunman, who was killed by police, as 26-year-old Redouane Lakdim, a small-time drug dealer. Security sources had said the gunman was believed to be a Moroccan who was on a watch list of suspected extremists, but Mr Collomb did not confirm his nationality. A source at the Interior Ministry said that while two people had died so far during the hostage-taking, the number of fatalities could go up. ""It is a provisional assessment as it could unfortunately get worse. Three people are wounded, including one of them seriously,"" the source said. French President Emmanuel Macron said security forces were securing the area. Speaking at a news conference in Brussels, where he was attending a European Union summit meeting, Mr Macron said: ""We believe that it is indeed a terror attack."" BFM TV station reported that the hostage-taker had claimed allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and that he had demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam - the prime surviving suspect in the ISIS attacks that killed 130 people in Paris in 2015. A 45-year-old lieutenant-colonel swapped himself in exchange for one of the hostages, a source close to the investigation said later, confirming information first published by Le Figaro newspaper. The officer was one of the policemen injured during the operation to kill the gunman. Mr Eric Menassi, the mayor of Trebes, told LCI TV that the man had entered the shop in Trebes screaming ""Allahu Akbar (God is greatest), I'll kill you all"". Ms Carole (only first name given), who was shopping at the supermarket, described how people had taken refuge in a cold room. ""A man shouted and fired several times. I saw a cold room door, I asked people to come and take shelter,"" she told Franceinfo radio. ""There were 10 of us, and we stayed for an hour. There were more gunshots and we went out the back door."" For the French authorities, what was particularly alarming about the events yesterday was that the area targeted was quiet and provincial, far from the big cities that have typically attracted terrorist violence. ""This can strike no matter where, no matter when, no matter how,"" said police union official Yves Lefebvre, speaking on Europe 1 radio. The EU offers its full support to the French people, European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said. More than 240 people have been killed in France since 2015 in attacks by assailants who pledged allegiance to, or were inspired by, ISIS."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Malaysia arrests two ISIS militants over planned attacks on police stations and Buddhist monks	"KUALA LUMPUR (REUTERS, THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Malaysia has arrested two men believed to have links with militant group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), including one who allegedly walked around its capital armed with a knife aiming to kill Buddhist monks, police said on Monday (Jan 22). The Muslim-majority South-east Asian nation has been on high alert since gunmen linked to ISIS launched several attacks in Jakarta, the capital of neighbouring Indonesia, in Jan 2016. The two suspects were arrested in two separate raids in December and January, on suspicion of planning to carry out acts of violence and promoting ISIS ideology. One of them, a 23-year-old Indonesian who was arrested last week on Jan 17, had allegedly scoured a busy district of the capital, Kuala Lumpur, in November, seeking Buddhist monks to kill, in retaliation for violence suffered by Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. ""The attempt failed, and police managed to confiscate a knife during the raid,"" Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi Harun, the inspector-general of police, said in a statement. The suspect had planned to attack the federal police headquarters in Bukit Aman as well as the Travers police station. He added that the suspect had also allegedly communicated with a senior ISIS leader over WhatsApp, had sought to recruit several other Indonesians and put up an ISIS flag at the building site where he worked. The other suspect, a 25-year-old Malaysian teacher at a private religious school, was detained in Dec on suspicion of planning an attack on entertainment outlets and to rob, kidnap or kill non-Muslims. The suspect, who had been previously jailed under Malaysia's anti-terror law, had also maintained contact with former members of known terror groups and promoted ISIS ideology on his Facebook account to recruit new members, police said. Separately,  the Kuala Lumpur High Court on Monday sentenced a former factory supervisor to eight years in jail for attempting to go to Syria with intent to commit terrorist acts. Mohamad Awang, 42, was arrested in Kuala Lumpur on Feb 21 last year with a flight ticket, an international passport, a handphone and several SIM cards in his possession. He had planned to go to Syria via Teheran. Malaysia has arrested hundreds of people over the past few years for suspected links to militant groups. A grenade attack on a bar on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur in June 2016 wounded eight people. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, the first such incident on Malaysian soil. Mr Fuzi also said in a statement on Monday that police will be ramping up security during the Hindu celebration of Thaipusam on Jan 31. ""Police will be increasing security measures in all locations across the country to prevent untoward incidents that could disrupt the event,"" he said."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Choke off terror recruitment sources, deputy minister urges"	"PUTRAJAYA, Jan 6 — The international community must work together to eliminate recruitment source of terror groups such as Islamic State (IS) who were quick to take advantage of ethnic and religious conflicts, Datuk Nur Jazlan Mohamed said today. Speaking in a panel at the Putrajaya International Security Dialogue 2018 at the Marriott Hotel here, the deputy home minister said conflicts such as the Rohingya Crisis in Myanmar is of particular concern. “Take for example the oppression and injustice committed against the Rohingyas, we fear that this will create an opportunity for organisations like IS to infiltrate and hijack their struggle, it would be better for us to work together and find a political solution before it evolves into religious strife,” Nur Jazlan said. He said terror groups had at times effectively exploited conflicts and indeed some attacks were specifically designed to cause discord between communities. “This why we see terror organisations purposely commit acts of terror specifically designed to create discord between communities including attacks on mosques and churches to targeted assassinations of community leaders, the goal is to create friction amongst communities,” he said. Nur Jazlan also said the internet, which has proven to be a major medium of recruitment and that every effort needed to be taken to identify extremists using it and to remove propaganda and literature use to draw vulnerable individuals to their cause. He said the present reality was one where conflict in one part of the world could lead to attacks thousands of miles away in the name of groups active in the conflict zone such as the 2016 Movida Club grenade attack in Puchong, and the Battle of Marawi in the Philippines with both claimed by the IS. “The internet, which has created a borderless world and has benefitted communities across the globe, the same technology has also been abused by terrorists. “Malaysia has initiated the Counter Messaging Centre under the purview of Royal Malaysia Police to monitor the use of internet and social media by terror groups to disseminate their radical ideology as well as to counter their narrative,” he said. He added that for a war for the hearts and minds of those who were vulnerable, it is critical to present a counter narrative that would appeal to the target group. “IS continues to recruit new members across the globe, mostly targeting the disfranchised by offering a form of escapism by tainting these young minds with their twisted world view and perverse ideology coupled the promise of a higher purpose in life. “Our counter narrative should be made attractive, relatable and relevant to the younger generation. It needs to be as creative, if not better than the likes of IS in order to counter their propaganda,” he said. Nur Jazlan asserted that Malaysia had been hugely effective in the fight against terrorism but that a greater emphasis needed to be placed on rehabilitation efforts as these would be key to victory in the long run. “Between 2013 and 2017 over 369 suspected IS militants, including 87 foreigners, has been arrested and up to 19 terror plots disrupted. “As nations invests and allocate a huge part of their budget to direct operational anti-terrorism purposes, they must also invest in programmes related to rehabilitation,” he said."

"PAF receives six US drones, beefs up anti-terror assets"	"The United States gave the Philippine air force on Tuesday its first surveillance drone system, as the two nations step up cooperation in the battle against jihadist militants.Washington has been boosting its backing for Philippine counter-terror efforts since Islamic State supporters seized parts of the southern city of Marawi last year, sparking a deadly five-month battle. The unmanned aerial vehicle system worth $13.2 million, including six drones, turned over to Philippine troops was the latest US military assistance. “Assets like the ScanEagle will significantly improve the [Philippine military’s] ability to detect terrorist activities, piracy activities, territory encroachment,” US Ambassador to Manila Sung Kim told reporters, referring to the drones. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the system, equipped with cameras and aircraft that can fly for 24 hours, would support operations against militants in the south.  The southern region of Mindanao is home to several pro-IS groups, including those that attacked Marawi in May last year in fighting that claimed more than 1,100 lives and reduced large parts of the city to rubble. These new drones are to be used for reconnaissance missions in defense, humanitarian assistance and disaster response, Lorenzana said.  “With a number of security issues confronting our country today, there is a need to upgrade our nation’s armed forces,” Lorenzana said.President Rodrigo Duterte had sought to loosen the Philippines’ 70-year alliance with the US in favor of closer ties with China and Russia.  His anger was partly driven by American criticism of his drug war, which has seen police kill thousands of people and prompted an International Criminal Court preliminary examination. Relations have improved under US President Donald Trump, who has praised Duterte for his drug war but the Philippine leader has increasingly turned to Beijing and Moscow to boost one of Asia’s weakest armed forces.  Duterte last month canceled a deal to buy helicopters from Canada after Ottawa ordered a review over human rights concerns.  “Do not buy anymore from Canada and the US because there is always a condition attached,” Duterte said at the time.  The US embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment on whether the drones implied similar rights concerns."	Terrorism	Terrorism
 Police to be active in anti-terrorism operations	" Police forces will be actively involved in addressing terrorism and insurgency problems especially in Mindanao as President Duterte stands firm on how his government will deal with communist terrorists – just like how the Maute Group was flushed out of Marawi City. Director General Ronald dela Rosa, chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP), said that no less than the President has instructed the police leadership to assist the military in running after terror groups and communist rebels. “There will be adjustments because the President wants us to be involved more aggressively in the problem of terrorism and insurgency,” said Dela Rosa. Speaking in Davao City last Friday night, Duterte said in a press conference that government forces will deal with communist fighters just the same as with Islamic State-influenced militants. “And we have this problem of terrorism – we will deal with them just like the way the Armed Forces and the police reacted during the Marawi siege. And for the communists, no quarters, no ask,” Duterte said. The Islamic State-inspired Maute Group occupied Marawi City on May 23, 2017, prompting Duterte to respond by ordering the military to bomb their positions and take them out and placing Mindanao under martial law. Although the PNP has its own elite force to run after insurgents, almost all the operations against terror and rebel groups are being carried out by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). “That is the reason why we are expediting the upgrading of our equipment and armaments to help the AFP regarding the problem,” said Dela Rosa. The communist rebel leadership earlier vowed to intensify the campaign against the government following the arrest of some of their peace talks consultants. Their founding leader, Jose Maria Sison, has said rebels should kill one soldier a day, to which the President responded by saying that he will order five terrorists killed for every life taken by the rebels. Last weekend, Duterte ordered the AFP to cancel the $233-million deal with Canada for the purchase of 16 helicopters after its government called for a review on this transaction for fear it might be used against rebels and terrorists. Duterte added if government forces could not use the helicopters against terrorists and rebels, the country must prepare for eventual collapse. He said that he cannot allow the global terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to further contaminate the country. “If I cannot use the gunship and helicopters, then I might as well surrender this government to them,” he said. “That’s the logic. I do not question your logic. Your logic is your logic. My logic is mine. It is based on the realities on the ground.” Duterte said he respects the stand of the Canada, whose government reportedly insisted it would only sell helicopters only for evacuation and emergency purposes and that it cannot be used against anti-insurgency operations. He, likewise, ordered the military not to buy even from the US. “So from here on, now, I am directing Armed Forces of the Philippines since most of the guns, bullets and whatever weapons of war, invariably could be used against the rebels and terrorists. Do not anymore get from Canada or from United States because there are always conditions attached,” he said. The President assured that he does not hate Canada, saying he still respects the values of its people. “I would assure the Canadian people – we are friends, we do not hate you, we love Canadians because there are a lot of Filipinos there,” Duterte said. “We respect the policy of the Canadian people, well and good. Do not buy anything that has something to do with arms,” Duterte said. “But if you need cosmetics, you want to be beautiful at beauty products, okay, you can buy them,” he added. Duterte said he opposes any condition that would restrict the use of helicopters in combating terrorists and communist rebels in the country. Meanwhile, only the AFP and the PNP are authorized to buy high-powered guns in the country. The President has prohibited gun stores from selling high-powered firearms even to government officials, saying such weapons must be returned to the national police headquarters. “I am ordering also the police to control the sale of – all gun stores are no longer allowed to sell high-powered guns, even to governors and mayors. Only the military and police can buy,” Duterte said. “And they should be taken off their shelf and returned to (Camp) Crame and that must be reflected there kung sinong nagbili, sinong tao, anong ranggo, saang unit [the buyer, rank, and unit],” he added. The President has sought to tighten gun purchase in the country to prevent the guns from falling into enemy hands. (With a report from Genalyn D.

"Inmate on leave kills three in Belgium, setting off terror probe"	"May 31, 2018 LIEGE (AP) – A knife-wielding prison inmate on a 48-hour leave stabbed two police officers on Tuesday in the Belgian city of Liege, seized their service weapons and shot them and a bystander to death before being mowed down by a group of officers, setting off a major terror investigation into the country’s most savage assault since 2016 suicide attacks. Prime Minister Charles Michel acknowledged the assailant, who had a lengthy criminal record that included theft, assault and drug offences, had appeared in three reports on radicalism but was still allowed to take a leave from prison. “Is our system working when we see that these kind of people are running free?” asked Vice Premier Alexander De Croo, echoing the thoughts of many in a nation where armed police and gun-toting soldiers still patrol the streets in the wake of the March 2016 attacks that left 32 people dead at the Brussels airport and subway system. Tuesday’s attack happened outside a cafe in the eastern city of Liege when the assailant crept up on the two female officers from behind and stabbed them repeatedly. “He then took their weapons. He used the weapons on the officers, who died,” the Liege prosecutor’s spokesman, Philippe Dulieu, told reporters. Forensic police work at the scene of a shooting in Liege, Belgium on May 29. – AP Dulieu said the attacker then shot and killed a 22-year-old teacher in a vehicle that was leaving a parking lot outside a nearby high school. He then took two women hostage inside the school before confronting police massed outside. “He came out firing at police, wounding a number of them, notably in the legs. He was shot dead,” the spokesman said, adding that the hostages escaped unharmed. Justice Minister Koen Geens described the assailant as a repeat offender who had been incarcerated since 2003 and was due for release in two years. Police Chief Christian Beaupere said “the goal of the attacker was to target the police”. He identified the slain officers as 45-year-old Lucile Garcia and 53-year-old Soraya Belkacemi. He said Belkacemi was the mother of 13-year-old twin daughters who had lost their father, also a police officer. Four other officers were wounded in the attack, one seriously with a severed femoral artery. Belgian media identified the suspect as Benjamin Herman, a Belgian national born in 1982, though in keeping with standard procedure authorities declined to confirm his identity. Interior Minister Jan Jambon said authorities were also investigating the suspected killing on Monday of an old acquaintance of the assailant and said there could be a link. “It is a serious hypothesis,” he told the VRT network. Michel said the suspect in Tuesday’s attack was indirectly mentioned in state security reports on radicalisation. But, the Prime Minister added, the reference was “in notes that did not primarily target him, but others or other situations”, and he was not on a list of suspects maintained by the main OCAD anti-terror assessment group. Belgium’s crisis centre said the country’s terror threat alert would not be raised and remained at level two out of four. It briefly stood at a maximum four shortly after the 2016 attacks. Belgium’s King Philippe, Michel and the country’s justice and interior ministers travelled to Liege to confer with local officials. “I want to offer my government’s support for the victims, for the victims’ families,” Michel said. It was not the first time Liege was hit by a violent attack. In December 2011, a man with a history of weapons and drug offences hurled hand grenades into a square filled with shoppers then opened fire on those who tried to escape. Five people were killed, including the assailant."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Citizens urged to remain vigilant, build strong cooperation to avert terror attack"	"CAMP BANCASI, Butuan City – The area command of the Army’s Northeastern and Northern Mindanao Fourth Infantry (Diamond) Division (4th ID) urged citizens to remain vigilant and build strong cooperation with the authorities to avert future terror attacks. Quoting the statement of the 4th ID chief Maj. Gen. Ronald C. Villanueva, 1st Lt. Tere Ingente, chief of Public Affairs Office (PAO) of 4th ID, said “the fight against terror is not just the work of the authorities.” It is “everyone’s responsibility” to keep every citizen safe and secure, the 4th ID PAO officer said. “We must help one another,” Lt. Ingente stressed in an exclusive interview with The Manila Bulletin on Thursday. She said, “any individual must build a strong cooperation with the authorities, by way of immediately reporting to the nearest police station or army detachment of any suspicious character or even grouping.” She said the 4th ID chief has a strong message in saying, “Everybody has a vital role to play.” Ingente said all field units have been instructed to continue conduct target-hardening measures in their respective areas, for the safety of villagers. The 4th “Diamond” Division appealed for public cooperation and asked residents to report suspicious people, she said. “Dako ug ikatabang ang kooperasyon sa mga tao sa amo para mabantayan ang mga lugar sa duha ka region (The cooperation of the public is a big help to us in securing the two regions),” 1st Lt. Ingente pointed out. The area command of the 4th ID issued the statement on Thursday following the bloody terror attack on Tuesday where 3 innocent civilians were killed while more than 30 other persons were injured in Isulan, Sultan Kudarat province. The 4th ID ordered all field units spread in the Northeastern and Northern Mindanao region’s to help their police counterparts in their mobile checkpoints to guard against lawless elements carrying explosives or improvised bombs. All field units also ordered to continue their Focus Military Operations (FMO) in their respective areas of responsibility (AORs) against communist terrorists, while also ready to accept those rebels who wanted to lay down their arms and avail the government’s peace and development program, 1st Lt. Ingente said. “Actually, our field units never lowered their guards since our Commander-In-Chief President Duterte declared martial law in the whole island of Mindanao,” she added."

Three charged over alleged terror plot in Melbourne	"Melbourne?Three men who allegedly plotted “chilling” terror attacks in Melbourne were charged early Tuesday, less than two weeks after a stabbing rampage inspired by the Islamic State group left two dead in Australia’s second city, police said. The trio, all Australian nationals of Turkish descent, were detained by counter-terror police in overnight raids as they escalated preparations to attack crowded areas of Melbourne, according to police.   The three, two brothers aged 31 and 26 and 21-year-old, were later charged with planning a terrorist action, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison, officials said. Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton said the men were “certainly inspired by ISIS”, the Islamic State group, but had no known links to a specific organization. They had been under investigation since March but had become “more energized” since the IS-inspired stabbing attack in Melbourne on November 9, he said. The men had sought to purchase semi-automatic .22 caliber rifles and police were concerned they could target upcoming Christmas season events that will see huge crowds gathering in the city. “There was a view towards a crowded place, a place where maximum people would be attending, to be able to kill, we allege, as maximum an amount of people as possible,” Ashton told reporters. The group had not yet picked a specific target or time for the attack, and Ashton added that police were confident Tuesday’s arrests had “neutralized any threat to the... community from this group”.  In the November 9 attack, a Somali-born Australian, Hassan Khalif Shire Ali, stabbed and killed one man and wounded two others in a central shopping area before being shot dead by police. Coincidentally, the victim of that attack, Sisto Malaspina, 74, was honored by a state funeral in Melbourne on Tuesday. Hundreds of Melbournians and dignitaries attended a service at Melbourne’s St Patrick’s Cathedral to bid farewell to Malaspina, the beloved owner of a local Italian cafe and a well-known figure on the city’s vibrant restaurant scene.The three arrested men were identified by local media as Ertunc and Samed Eriklioglu, aged 30 and 26 respectively, and Hanifi Halis, 21. Court officials could not immediately confirm their identities. “If we had not acted early in preventing this attack, we’ll allege the consequences would have been chilling, with... a potential significant loss of human life,” said Ian Mccartney, a federal counter-terror police spokesman, in announcing the arrests. Australian police have charged 90 people in relation to 40 counter-terrorism investigations since 2014, when the country’s terror alert level was raised to “probable”.  Melbourne has been the target for a number of attacks and plots. In addition to the November 9 knife rampage, a 28-year-old man was convicted on six counts of murder last week for mowing down dozens of people in the same street in January 2017, and Shire Ali’s brother is in jail awaiting trial for a plot to cause mass casualties last New Year’s in the city’s Federation Square. Shire Ali, like the three men arrested Tuesday, had his passport canceled to keep him from joining ISIS in the Mideast, and Ashton said this may have led to their actions at home. “Unfortunately, the ISIS propaganda machine and that of al-Qaeda promotes this type of activity so when people are prevented from traveling or it’s difficult to get to the conflict zone, often the view will be to change tack and commit an act in the country in which they live,” he said. Police said the probe which led to Tuesday’s arrests had been complicated by the suspects’ use of encrypted messaging applications, prompting the government to renew calls for urgent action on controversial legislation that would allow authorities to break the encryption. Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said nine out of 10 of the high priority intelligence investigations currently underway were being undermined by suspects’ use of encrypted messaging. “That’s an unacceptable risk in this environment,” he said."

"Nobel Peace Prize 2018: Nadia Murad, a former ISIS slave turned laureate"	" BAGHDAD (AFP) - Nadia Murad survived the worst cruelties ever inflicted on her people, the Yazidis of Iraq, before becoming a global champion of their cause and being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. On Friday (Oct 5), Murad and Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege were jointly awarded the prize for their ""efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war"", Nobel committee chairman Berit Reiss-Andersen said in unveiling the winners in Oslo. The 25-year-old Murad, her thin, pale face framed by her long brown hair, once lived a quiet life in her village near the mountainous Yazidi stronghold of Sinjar in northern Iraq, close to the border with Syria. But when the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group stormed across swathes of the two countries in 2014, her fate changed forever and her nightmare began. One day in August that year, pick-up trucks bearing the black flag of the militants swept into her village, Kocho. ISIS fighters set about killing the men, taking children captive to train them as fighters and condemning thousands of women to a life of forced labour and sexual slavery. Today, Murad and her friend Lamia Haji Bashar, joint recipients of the European Union's 2016 Sakharov human rights prize, continue the fight for the 3,000 Yazidis who remain missing, presumed still in captivity. ISIS fighters wanted ""to take our honour, but they lost their honour"", said Murad, now a United Nations goodwill ambassador for survivors of human trafficking. It is an evil she personally experienced during a harrowing three months. After being captured by ISIS fighters, Murad was taken by force to Mosul, the de facto ""capital"" of the militant group's self-declared caliphate. During her ordeal, she was held captive and repeatedly gang-raped, tortured and beaten. The militants organised slave markets for selling off the women and girls, and Yazidi women were forced to renounce their religion. For the militants, with their ultra-strict interpretation of Islam, the Yazidis are seen as heretics. The Kurdish-speaking community follows an ancient religion, revering a single God and the ""leader of the angels"", represented by a peacock. Like thousands of Yazidis, Murad was forcibly married to a militant, beaten and forced to wear make-up and tight clothes - an experience she later related in front of the United Nations Security Council. ""The first thing they did was they forced us to covert to Islam"", Murad told AFP in 2016. Shocked by the violence, Murad set about trying to escape, and managed to flee with the help of a Muslim family from Mosul. Armed with false identity papers, she managed to cross the few dozen kilometres to Iraqi Kurdistan, joining crowds of other displaced Yazidis in camps. There, she learnt that six of her brothers and her mother had been killed. With the help of an organisation that assists Yazidis, she joined her sister in Germany, where she lives today. She has since dedicated herself to what she calls ""our peoples' fight"", becoming a well-known spokesman even before the #MeToo movement swept the world. The Yazidis numbered around 550,000 in Iraq before 2014, but some 100,000 have since left the country. Many others have fled and remain in Iraqi Kurdistan, reluctant to return to their traditional lands. Slight and soft-spoken, Murad has now become a global voice, campaigning for justice for her people and for the acts committed by the militants to be recognised internationally as genocide. And she and the Yazidis have won a high-profile supporter - Lebanese-British lawyer and rights activist Amal Clooney, who also penned the foreword to Murad's book The Last Girl, published in 2017. The same year, the UN Security Council committed to helping Iraq gather evidence of ISIS crimes. Yet in contrast to all the tragedies that have befallen her, recent pictures on Murad's Twitter feed show happier times. In August, she announced her engagement to fellow Yazidi activist Abid Shamdeen. ""The struggle of our people brought us together & we will continue this path together,"" she wrote. Underneath, a photo showed her next to a young man in a bow tie, her face still framed by her long brown hair, but this time, bearing a broad smile."	Terrorism	Terrorism
 Duterte fears spread of terrorism outside Mindanao	" President Duterte expressed hope that the threat of terrorism will not go out Mindanao as he said that the government will find it difficult to address the situation, especially if war breaks out in more than one area. Duterte made the statement days after the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and Philippine National Police (PNP) announced the recent arrests of individuals allegedly link to the Islamic State (ISIS). The President, in a speech in Tarlac City Wednesday, also again floated the idea of arming civilians in case war breaks out in many areas in the Philippines, especially outside Mindanao. “This is hypothetical, I don’t want to scare you, but if you do it in the Visayas or Mindanao in three or four places simultaneously, mahihirapan po tayo (it will be very hard for us). It’s going to be bloody, very, very bloody,” Duterte said. “If hell breaks loose, I’d have to consult the military and maybe I will allow you to own high-powered guns. That is a far-fetched idea. I hope the trouble will be contained in Mindanao only,” he added. The Philippines dealt with ISIS elements, led by the Maute Group, as they laid siege in Marawi City, Lanao del Sur from May to October, 2017. The war prompted Duterte to declare martial law in the entire island in Mindanao for 60 days initially, until Congress granted its two extensions. The martial law in Mindanao will remain effective until the end of 2018. But four months after the government was able to quell the war in Marawi City, the military reported that the Islamic State may have already delegated a new leader in Southeast Asia, following the death of their emir Isnilon Hapilon during the war. Last week, Malacañang welcomed as a positive development in its campaign against terrorism the inclusion of the Maute Group in the United States of America (USA) State Department’s list of foreign terrorist organizations. The Maute Group is now one of the seven Islamic State (ISIS)-affiliate groups listed by the State Department as a terrorist organization from the Philippines, Bangladesh, Egypt, Somalia, Tunisia, and West Africa. “Terrorism, indeed, knows no borders and the inclusion of the Maute Group in the list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists and Foreign Terrorist Organizations as an affiliate group of ISIS shows the solidarity and resolve of the international community to flush out evil forces to make the world safe and secure,” The Palace said in a statement. In a statement posted in its website, the the State Department said that it “has designated three ISIS-affiliated groups – ISIS-West Africa, ISIS-Philippines, and ISIS-Bangladesh – as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs) under Section 1(b) of Executive Order (E.O.) 13224 and as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) pursuant to Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.” “The Department has also designated four other ISIS-affiliated groups and two ISIS-affiliated leaders as SDGTs under Section 1(b) of E.O. 13224. The groups are ISIS-Somalia, Jund al-Khilafah-Tunisia, ISIS-Egypt, and the Maute Group, and the individuals are Mahad Moalim and Abu Musab al-Barnawi,” the US top diplomatic agency added. In including ISIS-Philippines and the Maute Group, the State Department noted ISIS’s video of militants in the Philippines pledging allegiance to ISIS in June, 2016. The State Department also noted of the Maute Group’s declaration of their allegiance to ISIS in 2014 and for being an integral part of ISIS-Philippines. “The Maute Group is responsible for the siege of the City of Marawi in the Philippines, which began in May 2017; the September 2016 Davao market bombing, which killed 15 people and wounded 70 others; and the attempted bomb attack in November 2016 near the US Embassy in Manila,” the US State Department said."

Palace welcomes Maute group’s inclusion list of terror groups 	"By Roy C. Mabasa and Argyll Cyrus B. Geducos The Philippines welcomed the designation on Wednesday by the US State Department of ISIS-Philippines and the Maute Group as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs) and as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO). The State Department labeled ISIS-Philippines and the Maute Group, along with two other ISIS-affiliated groups – ISIS-West Africa and ISIS-Bangladesh–as SDGTs pursuant to Executive Order (EO) 13224 and as FTO pursuant to Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. EO 13224 was issued by US President George W. Bush on September 23, 2001, as a response to the 9/11 attacks and which targets terrorists and those providing support to terrorists or acts of terrorism. It imposes strict sanctions on foreign persons determined to have committed, or pose a significant risk of committing, acts of terrorism that threaten the security of US nationals or the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the US. As a result of these designations, US persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with ISIS-Philippines and the Maute Group. The groups’ property and interests in property subject to US jurisdiction are also blocked. In addition, it is a crime to knowingly provide, or attempt or conspire to provide, material support or resources to the said organizations. The Maute Group is one of seven Islamic State (ISIS)-affiliate groups listed by the State Department as terrorist organizations from the Philippines, Bangladesh, Egypt, Somalia, Tunisia, and West Africa. According to Presidential spokesman Harry Roque, the development proves the Philippine government’s belief that the Maute Group is being aided by foreign elements. “The official designation of the Maute Group as an affiliate group of ISIS and its inclusion in the US list of foreign terrorist organizations are positive developments in the campaign against terrorism,”Roque said in a statement Wednesday afternoon. “This reaffirms our long-held belief that the Maute Group is composed of local terrorists aided by foreign extremists,” he added. The Palace official also said that the official designation recognizes the Philippine government’s actions against the Maute Group when they laid a five-month siege in Marawi City, Lanaodel Sur, from May to October, 2017. “This likewise recognizes the decisive action we have taken in liberating Marawi from these terrorists, which resulted in the success of the government in thwarting the establishment of an Islamic caliphate in the area and the containing of the rebellion from spreading to other parts of the Philippines,”Roque said. “Terrorism, indeed, knows no borders and the inclusion of the Maute Group in the list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists and Foreign Terrorist Organizations as an affiliate group of ISIS shows the solidarity and resolve of the international community to flush out evil forces to make the world safe and secure,” he added. “The Department has also designated four other ISIS-affiliated groups and two ISIS-affiliated leaders as SDGTs under Section 1(b) of E.O. 13224. The groups are ISIS-Somalia, Jund al-Khilafah-Tunisia, ISIS-Egypt, and the Maute Group, and the individuals are MahadMoalim and Abu Musab al-Barnawi,” the US top diplomatic agency added. E.O. 13224 imposes strict sanctions on foreign persons determined to have committed, or pose a significant risk of committing, acts of terrorism that threaten the security of US nationals or the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States. In including ISIS-Philippines and the Maute Group, the State Department noted ISIS’s video of militants in the Philippines pledging allegiance to ISIS in June, 2016. “In the video, militants encouraged other Muslims to join the terrorist group and support ISIS’s efforts in the region under the command of now-deceased SDGT Isnilon Hapilon – recognized by ISIS as the leader of ISIS-Philippines,” it said. The State Department also noted the Maute Group’s declaration of their allegiance to ISIS in 2014 and for being an integral part of ISIS-Philippines. “The Maute Group is responsible for the siege of the City of Marawi in the Philippines, which began in May, 2017; the September, 2016 Davao market bombing, which killed 15 people and wounded 70 others; and the attempted bomb attack in November, 2016, near the US embassy in Manila,” it added. The Maute Group, also known as the Islamic State of Lanao, is a radical Islamist group composed of former Moro Islamic Liberation Front guerrillas and foreign fighters led by Abdullah Maute, the alleged founder of a DawlahIslamiya, or Islamic state based in Lanaodel Sur. In a statement, Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Ernesto Abella said the Philippine government is “profoundly committed to preventing ISIS from gaining foothold in the Philippines and in Southeast Asia.” “Terrorism is a global and regional challenge, and cooperation with key allies is critical in averting terrorist operations,” said Abella. “While we have concluded a successful campaign in Marawi against the Maute group, countering terrorism continues to be a priority of this administration.”"	Terrorism	Terrorism
Indonesian duo in terror plot face death penalty	"A former Indonesian migrant worker who was deported from Hong Kong last year after she posted a Facebook video of her pledging allegiance to Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is now facing the death sentence along with her newly wed husband for terror-related offences at home. Both are facing charges in connection with planning terror attacks and making explosives in a rented house in Bandung. ""Anggi Indah Kusuma alias Khanza Syafiyah al-Fuqron has committed evil conspiracy, consciously tried to or assisted (others) to carry out terror acts. She has made and stored explosives with the intention to launch terror acts,"" stated court documents seen by The Straits Times. Anggi, 24, returned to Indonesia in March last year and was immediately interrogated by police. She was subsequently sent to a Social Affairs Ministry rehabilitation centre before being allowed to go home to her parents in Klaten, Central Java. But in May last year, Anggi fled home and married another migrant worker, Adilatul Rahman alias Rahman Factory, who had returned home from Malaysia. Her parents disapproved of the marriage. Anggi was introduced to Rahman on Facebook while she was in Hong Kong and, after their marriage, the couple moved to Bandung, West Java. Less than three months after their wedding, on Aug 15 last year, Anggi and Rahman were nabbed during simultaneous raids by Densus 88, the elite counter-terrorism unit, on three places in Bandung. Three of their accomplices were also picked up. All those arrested were allegedly members of a terror cell manufacturing homemade chemical bombs to be used to attack the presidential palace in Jakarta, the police mobile brigade squad headquarters outside Jakarta and state-owned weapons manufacturer PT Pindad. Court documents said that in early August, Rahman and an accomplice, Young Farmer alias Abu Nakir Shaab, went to a chemical store in Bandung to procure bomb-making materials but could not get any because the store required identification from the buyers, who also had to certify their use. The men then resorted to a popular local online marketplace, procured the materials and had them delivered on Aug 11 to the rented house in Bandung. The couple as well as their accomplices then began the process of making a bomb using a manual provided by Young Farmer, whose real name has not been established yet. The court was told that while making the bomb, everyone was shocked by thick smoke and a strong odour in a room in Rahman's house. Anggi, who was then pregnant, was nauseous. The decision was then taken to move the process to Young Farmer's house, also in Bandung. Counter-terrorism officials said Anggi was radicalised while in Hong Kong after she befriended two men, Musa Wisesa and Abu Alqosam al-Ajeneseh, who indoctrinated her on Islamic syariah law and the ISIS caliphate. The court documents did not provide further details about the two men but said that not long after Anggi befriended them, she pledged allegiance to al-Baghdadi in a Hong Kong park.

Husband and wife face death penalty on terror charges in Indonesia	"JAKARTA - A former Indonesian migrant worker, who last year was deported from Hong Kong after she posted a Facebook video of her pledging allegiance to Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is now facing the death sentence along with her newly-wed husband for planning terror attacks and making explosives in a rented house in Bandung. ""Anggi Indah Kusuma alias Khanza Syafiyah al-Fuqron has committed evil conspiracy, consciously tried to or assisted (others) to carry out terror acts. She has made and stored explosives with the intention to launch terror acts,"" said court documents seen by The Straits Times. Anggi, 24, returned to Indonesia in March 2017, and was immediately interrogated by police. She was subsequently sent to a social affairs ministry rehabilitation centre before being allowed to go home to her parents in Klaten, Central Java. But, in May last year, Anggi fled home and married another migrant worker, Rahman Factory, who had returned home from Malaysia. Her parents disapproved of the marriage. Anggi was first introduced to Rahman on Facebook while she was in Hong Kong and, after their marriage, the couple moved to Bandung,  in West Java. Less than three months after their wedding, on Aug 15, 2017, Anggi and Rahman were nabbed during simultaneous raids by Densus 88, the elite counter-terrorism unit, on three places in Bandung. Three of their alleged accomplices were also picked up. All of those arrested were allegedly members of a terror cell, who were manufacturing home-made chemical bombs to be used to attack the presidential palace in Jakarta, the police mobile brigade squad headquarters outside Jakarta and state-owned weapons manufacturer PT Pindad. Court documents said that, in early August, Rahman and an accomplice, Young Farmer alias Abu Nakir Shaab , went to a chemical store in Bandung to procure bomb-making materials but could not get hold of any because the store required identification from the buyers who also had to certify their use. The men then resorted to a popular local online marketplace, procured the materials and had them delivered on Aug 11 to the rented house in Bandung. The couple as well and their accomplices then began the process of making a bomb using a manual provided by Young Farmer, whose real name has not been established yet. The court was told that, while making the bomb, everyone was shocked by thick smoke and strong odour in the room of Rahman's house. Anggi, who was then pregnant, was nauseous. The decision was then taken to move the process to Young Farmer's house, also in Bandung. Counter-terrorism officials said Anggi was radicalised while in Hong Kong after she befriended two men, Musa Wisesa and Abu Alqosam al-Ajeneseh, who indoctrinated her on Islamic sharia law and the ISIS caliphate. The court documents did not provide further details about the two men but said that not long after Anggi befriended them she pledged allegiance to al-Baghdadi at Yuen park, in Hongkong. A fellow Indonesian videotaped her reading a text provided by Abu Alqosam and Anggi then uploaded the footage to her Facebook account. She also uploaded a write-up, professing her radical ideology. Anggi then created a chatgroup on her Telegram mobile messaging account and called it ""Redaksi Khilafah"" (Caliphate Editorial). It eventually had 86 members. Anggi was also a member in seven other radical Telegram chat groups."	Terrorism	Terrorism
 3 stabbed in Melbourne terror attack	" MELBOURNE • A knife-wielding man set fire to a pickup truck laden with gas cylinders in the Australian city of Melbourne yesterday and stabbed three people, killing one, before he was shot by police. Police called the rampage an act of terrorism, while the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) claimed responsibility for the attack. The truck carrying barbecue gas cylinders burned on busy Bourke Street just before the evening rush hour as the driver stabbed bystanders and attacked police. The cylinders did not explode and the fire was put out in 10 minutes, by which point the attack was over. ""We are still trying to piece together whether the vehicle was lit, then he got out the car or whether he got out the car and then the vehicle took flame,"" said Victoria Police Commissioner Graham Ashton. Video posted on Twitter and broadcast on television showed the man swinging a knife at two police officers, while his utility truck burned in the background. One of the officers shot the man and he collapsed to the ground clutching his chest, the video showed. Other footage showed two stab victims lying on the ground. The attacker, said to be a Somali-born man aged 31, died in hospital, as did one of the victims. Mr Ashton said: ""From what we know of that individual, we are treating this as a terrorism incident."" Asked about what the attacker had been planning, Mr Ashton referred to the gas cylinders in the truck and said: ""You could make certain assumptions from that."" Victoria police declined to comment when contacted about the ISIS claim. The militant group also claimed responsibility for a deadly siege in the city in 2017 when a Somali man was killed by police after taking a woman hostage. Mr Ashton said there was no longer a threat to the public, but that security would be boosted at horse races and Remembrance Day memorials over the weekend. Police did not identify the attacker but Mr Ashton said the man was known to them and the intelligence authorities. Mr Ashton declined to release the names of the victims, all male, because police were still in the process of contacting their families. Police later said the two wounded men were aged 26 and 58. Asked if the attacker had recently travelled to Syria, he said: ""That is something we might be able to talk more about tomorrow."" A staunch US ally, Australia has been on alert for such violence after a Sydney cafe siege in 2014, and its intelligence agencies have stepped up scrutiny, though there was no warning of the latest attack. The authorities say Australia's vigilance has helped it to foil at least a dozen plots, including a plan to attack downtown Melbourne at Christmas in 2016. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a statement released on Twitter: ""Australia will never be intimidated by these appalling attacks."" Video on social media showed chaotic scenes as bystanders scattered while the attacker fought with police and his victims lay bleeding on the footpath. One man charged at the attacker, who was wearing a long black shirt, with a shopping trolley just before police drew their weapons. Victoria's Premier Daniel Andrews said the attack was ""an evil, terrifying thing"". A fatal but not terror-related attack took place on the same street last year, after a man drove his car at pedestrians, killing six people and wounding dozens. That prompted the city to install hundreds of security bollards. In December 2014, two hostages were killed during a 17-hour siege by a ""lone wolf"" gunman in a cafe in Sydney."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Jakarta minister cites Marawi siege to stress sharing of intelligence	"Precious lives could have been saved if government agencies and ministries within the region had shared and exchanged quality intelligence during the May 2017 siege of Marawi in the Philippines. The incident could have been prevented or even pre-empted, Indonesia's Defence Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu said yesterday in his keynote address at the opening of the 2018 South-east Asia Counter-Terrorism Symposium: A Collective Approach. ""The siege of Marawi demonstrated that our region was unprepared for the current and emerging wave of terrorism,"" said the retired general. ""It also demonstrated the need for a new security architecture for the Asean region."" Mr Ryamizard was one of four guest speakers at the event organised by the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS). The two-day symposium at the Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel was organised as part of Singapore's Asean chairmanship. The Marawi attack by Filipino militants aligned with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group was cited by the minister to highlight lapses in intelligence sharing. ""Regional governments were culpable for not exchanging intelligence sufficiently to prevent the fall of Marawi city to IS (ISIS). Even after the siege of Marawi, the flow of intelligence was absent, partial or flawed,"" he said. The siege lasted five months, resulting in more than 900 militants being captured or killed. While ISIS may have been defeated in the Middle East last year, the threat of terrorism remains a key challenge in South-east Asia. Today, 63 terror groups in Southeast Asia have pledged allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi. On May 13, there were multiple suicide attacks involving entire families - including women and children - in the Indonesian city of Surabaya. Recently uncovered plots revealed plans by terrorists to make anthrax and botulinum in Malaysia, and ricin and thorium in Indonesia. Mr Ryamizard added that the July 31 suicide bombing in Basilan in the Philippines by a Moroccan terrorist was ""the most significant recent attack"". Asean is trying to get its act together. On Jan 25, six nations from the region formally launched the Our Eyes Initiative in Bali to share intelligence among themselves. The idea for this originated when he visited RSIS in July last year, Mr Ryamizard said. ""Evil will spread when good men do nothing. We have to do something (to fight terrorism),"" he said. Mr Ryamizard added that meeting Singapore's Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam gave him confidence to build a collaborative intelligence platform. In the end, the defence ministers of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Brunei agreed to establish a joint working group, with plans to include more nations later. The new pact would create a common database, facilitate the exchange of personnel, and share expertise, resources and experiences, including conducting joint training and operations. Still, returning ISIS fighters continue to be one of the current concerns, said Ambassador-at-Large Ong Keng Yong, executive deputy chairman of RSIS. Unlike Al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiah, ISIS has capitalised on the use of cyberspace to spread its violent message. ""ISIS operatives, sympathisers, fanboys and fangirls have benefited greatly from the use of the darker corners of the Internet,"" Mr Ong said in his opening remarks. Philippine Undersecretary of National Defence Cardozo Luna said the recent terrorist attacks in South-east Asia have shown patterns of ""radicalisation, sources of terror financing and technological and tactical sophistication"". ""Daesh (ISIS) has been able to provide occasional money transfers to the Maute group (involved in the Marawi attack) using electronic transfers,"" said Mr Luna."	Terrorism	Terrorism

Pope condemns bombing of Philippines cathedral as 'terrorist attack'	"PANAMA CITY, Jan 28 — Pope Francis yesterday condemned the twin bombings that killed at least 20 people during a Catholic Church service in the Philippines as a “terrorist attack” and prayed that God would convert the hearts of those who carried it out. The attack also wounded 81 and was one of the deadliest in recent years in a region long plagued by instability. Francis, speaking at a hospice for AIDS sufferers on the last day of his trip here, expressed his ""firm condemnation of this act of violence that causes more mourning in the Christian community. I pray for the dead and the injured. May the Lord, prince of peace, convert the hearts of the violent ones."" There was no immediate claim of responsibility but police suspect the bombings were the work of Abu Sayyaf, a militant group that has pledged allegiance to Islamic State and is notorious for its bombings and brutality. The first explosion went off inside the cathedral on Jolo Island in Sulu Province, and was followed by a second blast outside, which was detonated as security forces raced to the scene, officials said. The pope visited the Philippines, the most Catholic country in Asia, in 2015."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Philippines, Jordan unite in fight against terrorism"	"AMMAN — The Philippines and Jordan have vowed to unite in the fight against terrorism as they admitted that the threat posed by extremists may not be quelled anytime soon. President Rodrigo Duterte and Jordanian King Abdullah II stressed that terrorism is a ""scourge"" and an ""evil"" that is threatening their countries' security and causing suffering to people in their regions. ""I think one of the main things that bind us together is the scourge of terrorism which is a challenge for our region and your region, for your country and my country....the international cooperation and coordination...is now becoming much more apparent because this is an issue that’s going to last with us not only for the next five to ten, 15 years,"" King ABdullah said during his bilateral meeting with Duterte. ""It’s going to take us a while to overcome the...mentalities that these very horrible evil people perpetrated in your region and in mine,"" he added. Duterte, the first sitting Philippine president to visit Jordan, agreed that terrorism cannot be defeated easily but expressed hope that the next generation would be able to ""live comfortably."" He said the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the extremist group that threatens Jordan's borders, has been establishing operational hubs in Mindanao, which is till grappling with a decades-old Muslim insurgency. ""Terrorism is the scourge of mankind today and it will take us about a lot more years to stop it,"" the president said. Duterte thanked Abdullah for providing military equipment to the Philippines and promised to boost the Philippines' friendship with Jordan. Jordan has agreed to provide two used Cobra attack helicopters to the Philippines, a development that officials said would enhance the military's drive against terrorism and other security threats. The two helicopters are expected to be delivered in July next year after the nine-month training of Filipino pilots. Jordan also vowed to provide brand-new rifles, mortars, and rocket-propelled grenades. In a business forum held hours after his working lunch with King Andullah, Duterte expressed readiness to provide Jordan troops if needed. ""I'll leave you my guarantee that we will be friends and we will nurse and nurture it fully so that someday my people can really say that you paved the way for the good relationship. If you are short of your army, let me know,"" he said. ""You need one battalion? Two, three, four, five? I'll send them to you. So no problem. I will commit my government in the right side of history. The right side of history is that you are fair and that you can understand the problems of humanity and that you realize that you need as much as I need you in order to (work) this place called Earth, beautiful and working for all of us,"" he added.

Martial law not effective in combating terrorism in Mindanao — US Dept. of State official	"WASHINGTON DC— The imposition of martial law may be making places like Mindanao in the Philippines more vulnerable to terrorism and creating safe havens for extremists, a US Department of State official told visiting journalists here on Wednesday. Irfan Saeed, director of the Office of Countering Violent Extremism under the State Department’s Bureau of Counterterrorism and Countering Violent Terrorism, said a community approach, rather than a military approach, might be a better tool at a time when Islamic State fighters were turning to Southeast Asia as a refuge for their activities. Asked by the Inquirer if martial law was effective in combating terrorism in Mindanao, he said: “No. That is the short answer.” “The response to terrorism and our efforts in countering violent extremism cannot be an excuse for an overly aggressive law enforcement approach,” he said during a briefing for the 2018 East-West Center’s Seminar for Senior Journalists. “We’ve learned very clearly that this suppression of basic human rights, of civil liberties of the things that are required of countries under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, if you violate those basic human rights and liberties, you’re actually bringing a greater ability to recruit people to violent extremism,” Saeed said. “We have seen the suppression of basic human rights as a potential driver of terrorism,” he added. He said the Philippines, especially Mindanao, was at a pivotal point considering the risks it faced from ISIS recruits. “The Philippines is a very important place… as we start to look at the next iteration of ISIS and terrorist spiders,” he said. Saeed said the more appropriate approach would be to make communities more aware of their responsibility to deny terrorists safe havens, especially in areas with no military response, such as Southeast Asia, Pakistan, and the Balkans. “Because when you have a government only responsible for denying those safe havens, you have the possibility of an overly aggressive approach, and that, as we know, does not work,” he said. Mindanao has been under martial law since mid-2017 in the aftermath of the May 2017 siege of Marawi City by militants. Congress later approved two extensions of military rule and the suspension of the writ of the privilege of habeas corpus in the region. However, violent attacks still happened in Mindanao in recent months despite the declaration of martial law. In late August, terrorists set off homemade bombs that killed at least two persons and injured dozens of others in Isulan town, Sultan Kudarat. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, according to a US intelligence group. On July 31, at least 10 people were killed and several others wounded when a van exploded outside a checkpoint in the Island city of Lamitan in Basilan. Instead of returning to their home countries upon radicalization, “we’re starting to see people return to third countries where they feel like they can have safe havens,” he said. “And unfortunately, places across Southeast Asia, but in particular the Philippines— we know the attack in Marawi — this is where we are starting to have some very clear concerns about safe havens,” Saeed said. The seminar organized by the Honolulu-based East-West Center is an annual fellowship for journalists in the US and countries with substantial Muslim populations, who go on a three-week tour of US, Asia, and Africa to study the role of religion in the public sphere."

"PH, Jordan denounce terrorism"	" AMMAN, Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan — President Duterte thanked Jordan King Abdullah II for the arms that the Kingdom is going to provide the Philippines in order to boost its defense capabilities. Duterte made the statement during his working lunch with the Jordanian monarch when he visited the Al Husseiniya Palace in Amman Thursday afternoon (Jordan time). Duterte told Abdullah that the arms that will be given to the Philippines will be of great help. “And of course, our concern against terrorism which brings us here the — well of course what we have discussed, the arms that would be of great help. If there’s any value, it is of value and the friendship that goes with it,” he said. Special Assistant to the President Christopher Go earlier confirmed that Jordan will be turning over to the Philippines two second-hand Cobra attack helicopters in July next year after the training of Filipino pilots. Go also said that Jordan will also be giving the Philippines mortars, rifles, and rocket-propelled grenades. Terrorism far from over Both Duterte and Abdullah also agreed that it will take a long time before terrorism would be completely purged. Abdullah told Duterte that it will take not only the next 10 to 15 years to overcome the influence of “horrible” people in the southeast and western Asia. “Over the past several months, if not the past year or two, the cooperation between our two countries to fight the evil that you have to suffer within your country as we suffer in ours, I think is a testament to the international cooperation and coordination that is now becoming much more apparent,” the King said. “This is an issue that’s going to last with us not only for the next five to 10, 15 years as you are trying very hard to be very quick, but it’s going to take us a while to overcome the mentalities that these very horrible people perpetrated in your region and in mine,” he added. Duterte agreed that it will take a long time before terrorism could be quelled, but hopes that the next generation would not be able to experience any terrorist act. “And terrorism is the scourge of mankind today and it will take us about a lot more years to stop it. I really do not know how long,” Duterte told Abdullah. “God’s will. But Insha’Allah, I hope that it will — maybe… Not so much for this generation but for the next generation for them to live comfortably,” he added. Duterte also told Abdullah that the Islamic State (ISIS) would most likely be targeting the Philippines if they are running out of territory in the Middle East. “There’s a lot of activity sponsored by the ISIS. If they’re running out of ground here in the Middle East and if they look to find ways, maybe transfer their headquarter, they would choose Southeast Asia and Mindanao, it’s a place where… where there’s a lot of our Muslim brothers and Christian sisters live there,” he said. The Philippine government was able to overcome the strength of pro-ISIS terrorists when it laid siege in Marawi City, Lanao del Sur for five months from May last year."	Terrorism	Terrorism
‘I saw everything flying’	"ISULAN, SULTAN KUDARAT—“I saw everything flying,” Francis Suerte, 26, said, describing the chaos at a used-clothing store at the time of the bomb blast that tore through a crowd at a night market in Kalawag 3 village here on Tuesday night, killing two people, including a young girl, and wounding 35 others. “The explosion was very powerful, the ground was shaking, used clothing and everything flying, people were running in different directions,” said Suerte, who sustained shrapnel injuries on both legs. Seconds before he was hit, he said, a militiaman saw a man put a bag under a parked motorbike, only 3 meters from where he stood. When the militiaman called the man’s attention, the man ran away. Other militiamen gave chase, but the man jumped on a waiting motorbike driven by an accomplice and the two sped away. Just then, an explosion ripped through the place, felling everyone within 50 meters of the blast site, Isulan Mayor Marites Pallasigue said. “Pandemonium broke loose and every one near the parked motorbike were yelling for help,” said Suerte, a resident of Sen. Ninoy Aquino town in Sultan Kudarat who considered himself lucky because his injuries were not fatal. “I dropped and crawled my way out of the pile of used clothing,” Suerte said. “I saw a girl lying in a pool of blood right after the blast, I think she died,” he said in Filipino. Lenie Ombrog, 52, of Barangay Kalawag, was killed outright, while Davy Shane Alayon, 7, who lived in Bagumbayan town, Sultan Kudarat, died in the hospital on Wednesday morning, said Supt. Aldrin Gonzales, speaking for the regional police. Among the injured were Sgt. Timjar Hambali and M/Sgt. Jo Capilitan, both of the Army’s 33rd Infantry Battalion, and Protestant pastor Raymund Malves, 60. “Most of the victims are already out of the hospital,” Pallasigue said. “Only those with serious leg injuries remain at Sultan Kudarat Provincial Hospital,” she added. She said two of those people were in critical condition. Malacañang condemned the attack and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice. “Authorities are now investigating the incident and we vow to bring the perpetrators of this brazen attack to justice. We will apply the full force of the law,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said. Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea said extending martial law in Mindanao was an option that the government was considering after the attack in Isulan. Mindanao has been under martial law since May 2017, when local terrorists who had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) jihadi group in the Middle East seized Marawi City. Extended by Congress after the seige to allow the military to deal with the remnants of the Maute and Abu Sayyaf groups that held the city for five months, the declaration would lapse on December 31. Senate President Vicente Sotto III said on Wednesday that the attack might be an indication that martial law was not being enforced strictly enough in Mindanao. Still, Sotto said it was premature to discuss whether an extension was necessary, despite the violence. “For all we know, in a month or two, everything that happened there would be resolved already,” he said. Vice President Leni Robredo opposed an extension, saying martial law had failed to stop terrorist attacks in Mindanao. “What assurance do we have that an extension would prevent attacks?” Robredo said. Communist Party of the Philippines founder Jose Maria Sison also opposed an extension, saying the Duterte administration was just looking for a reason to justify the continued enforcement of martial law in Mindanao and attacks on the party’s armed wing, the New People’s Army (NPA). In an online interview from exile in Utrecht, the Netherlands, Sison said NPA fighters would defend themselves against attacks by government forces. The Philippine National Police went on full alert throughout Mindanao and heightened alert in Metropolitan Manila after the bombing. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the largest Muslim insurgency group in Mindanao that has signed a peace agreement with the government, condemned the attack in Isulan, which it said had the signature of IS. “If they look at the kind of signature as well as the way the attack was carried out, it was pointing toward [IS],” MILF chief peace negotiator Mohagher Iqbal said. “We condemn it,” Iqbal said. “It’s the handiwork of bloody minded people and it served no purpose. Those who perpetrated the bombing were peace spoilers.” The blast happened as Isulan celebrated its 61st founding anniversary and a local festival called Hamungaya. No one among the local armed groups claimed responsibility for the blast, but IS did, according to the Maryland-based SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks online activities of white supremacist and jihadi organizations. SITE said the IS East Asia Province claimed bombing Filipino soldiers in Isulan. Chief Insp. Ronnie Dardo, spokesperson for the provincial police, could not confirm that the attack was carried out by IS, but said police had intercepted information about a possible attack by the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) in nearby Maguindanao province. “We believe that the terrorist group BIFF is the primary suspect behind this atrocity,” Col. Noel Detoyato, chief of the public affairs office of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, told a news briefing at Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City. “They are the ones who have the strongest evil desire to initiate this kind of attacks that victimize innocent civilians and disrupt peace,” Detoyato said. In Isulan, Dardo said two other homemade bombs were recovered and defused at the blast site. Capt. Arvin Encinas, spokesperson for the 6th Infantry Division, also blamed the attack on the BIFF and said military operations against the group would continue. “These bomb attacks are part of the BIFF’s retaliation against the military for the losses they suffered at the hands of our troops. It is unfortunate that their retaliation did not spare innocent civilians,” Encinas said by phone. He said that since the start of the year, at least 40 BIFF fighters had been killed in clashes with government troops in Maguindanao and North Cotabato provinces, a claim that could not be independently verified in the absence of actual body counts. In June, Brig. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, 6th Infantry Division commander, said troops dismantled a BIFF bomb-making facility in Maguindanao province. Encinas said the BIFF had splintered into three factions, each with about 60 fighters. The faction led by Abu Turaife has pledged allegiance to IS and is allegedly getting financial support from the jihadi group, he said. The two other factions are led by Commander Bongos and Ustadz Karialan, he said. Abu Misry Mama, spokesperson for the IS-linked faction of the BIFF, said his group was not behind the Isulan bombing. “We have nothing to do with it. We don’t attack civilians,” Mama said by phone. Encinas said Tuesday’s attack in Isulan was believed to have been carried out by two fighters from the Bongos faction. Sultan Kudarat Gov. Pax Mangudadatu offered a P1-million reward for information that would lead to the capture of the perpetrators."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Democrats: Trump needs Congress approval for broader Syria effort	" WASHINGTON (AFP) - US President Donald Trump's announcement on Friday (April 13) of air strikes in Syria triggered swift warnings from opposition Democrats that any broader military campaign there would require a well-formulated strategic vision - and authorisation from Congress. Mr Trump said US forces launched ""precision"" strikes against Syrian targets, and that the United States would ""sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents"". House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi led calls for Mr Trump to map out a detailed plan and present it to Congress if he wants to expand military action. ""One night of air strikes is no substitute for a coherent strategy,"" Ms Pelosi said in a statement. Mr Trump ""must come to Congress to obtain a new AUMF (authorisation for use of military force), present a clear set of objectives, & ultimately hold Putin accountable for the bloodshed he has enabled"", she added, referring to President Vladimir Putin of Russia, the Syrian regime's most powerful ally. US military forces have largely been operating under AUMFs passed by Congress shortly after the 9/11 attacks to conduct operations against extremist groups like the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), including in Syria. Some Democrats like Senator Tim Kaine, the party's vice-presidential nominee in 2016, said although last week's deadly apparent chemical attack was an abomination, Mr Trump's air strikes were illegal. ""The last thing Congress should be doing is giving this President a blank check to wage war against anyone, anywhere. We need to put clear limits in place before he starts another war,"" said Mr Kaine. ""Today, it's a strike on Syria - what's going to stop him from bombing Iran or North Korea next?"" Congressman Eric Swalwell reminded that Mr Trump launched missile strikes without congressional approval against a Syrian air field last year. ""What's changed? Zero. They're still using chemical weapons,"" he said. ""This is the result of a failure to have a strategy and engage Middle East countries to solve this problem."" ""The precision targeting of military targets are needed in the fight of good versus evil, a fight of the United States versus the dark edge of humanity,"" Senator Cory Gardner said. ""These offensive strikes against Syria are unconstitutional, illegal, and reckless,"" Mr Amash said, adding that the next House Speaker who succeeds the outgoing Mr Paul Ryan should ""reclaim congressional war powers""."

"Britain, France, and US have marshalled their righteous power against barbarism and brutality: Trump"	"WASHINGTON (REUTERS) - The following is the full text of US President Donald Trump's remarks on Friday (April 13) announcing military strikes targeting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's chemical weapons capabilities after a poison gas attack that killed at least 60 people last week. THE PRESIDENT: My fellow Americans, a short time ago, I ordered the United States Armed Forces to launch precision strikes on targets associated with the chemical weapons capabilities of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. A combined operation with the armed forces of France and the United Kingdom is now underway. We thank them both. Tonight, I want to speak with you about why we have taken this action. One year ago, Assad launched a savage chemical weapons attack against his own innocent people. The United States responded with 58 missile strikes that destroyed 20 per cent of the Syrian Air Force. Last Saturday, the Assad regime again deployed chemical weapons to slaughter innocent civilians - this time, in the town of Douma, near the Syrian capital of Damascus. This massacre was a significant escalation in a pattern of chemical weapons use by that very terrible regime. The evil and the despicable attack left mothers and fathers, infants and children, thrashing in pain and gasping for air. These are not the actions of a man; they are crimes of a monster instead. Following the horrors of World War I a century ago, civilised nations joined together to ban chemical warfare. Chemical weapons are uniquely dangerous not only because they inflict gruesome suffering, but because even small amounts can unleash widespread devastation. The purpose of our actions tonight is to establish a strong deterrent against the production, spread, and use of chemical weapons. Establishing this deterrent is a vital national security interest of the United States. The combined American, British, and French response to these atrocities will integrate all instruments of our national power - military, economic, and diplomatic. We are prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents. I also have a message tonight for the two governments most responsible for supporting, equipping, and financing the criminal Assad regime. To Iran, and to Russia, I ask: What kind of a nation wants to be associated with the mass murder of innocent men, women, and children? The nations of the world can be judged by the friends they keep. No nation can succeed in the long run by promoting rogue states, brutal tyrants, and murderous dictators. In 2013, President Putin and his government promised the world that they would guarantee the elimination of Syria's chemical weapons. Assad's recent attack - and today's response - are the direct result of Russia's failure to keep that promise. Russia must decide if it will continue down this dark path, or if it will join with civilised nations as a force for stability and peace. Hopefully, someday we'll get along with Russia, and maybe even Iran - but maybe not. I will say this: The United States has a lot to offer, with the greatest and most powerful economy in the history of the world. In Syria, the United States - with but a small force being used to eliminate what is left of ISIS - is doing what is necessary to protect the American people. Over the last year, nearly 100 per cent of the territory once controlled by the so-called ISIS caliphate in Syria and Iraq has been liberated and eliminated. The United States has also rebuilt our friendships across the Middle East. We have asked our partners to take greater responsibility for securing their home region, including contributing large amounts of money for the resources, equipment, and all of the anti-ISIS effort. Increased engagement from our friends, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, and others can ensure that Iran does not profit from the eradication of ISIS. America does not seek an indefinite presence in Syria under no circumstances. As other nations step up their contributions, we look forward to the day when we can bring our warriors home. And great warriors they are. Looking around our very troubled world, Americans have no illusions. We cannot purge the world of evil, or act everywhere there is tyranny. No amount of American blood or treasure can produce lasting peace and security in the Middle East. It's a troubled place. We will try to make it better, but it is a troubled place. The United States will be a partner and a friend, but the fate of the region lies in the hands of its own people. In the last century, we looked straight into the darkest places of the human soul. We saw the anguish that can be unleashed and the evil that can take hold. By the end of the World War I, more than one million people had been killed or injured by chemical weapons. We never want to see that ghastly spectre return. So today, the nations of Britain, France, and the United States of America have marshalled their righteous power against barbarism and brutality. Tonight, I ask all Americans to say a prayer for our noble warriors and our allies as they carry out their missions. We pray that God will bring comfort to those suffering in Syria. We pray that God will guide the whole region toward a future of dignity and of peace. And we pray that God will continue to watch over and bless the United States of America. Thank you, and goodnight. Thank you."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Asean, Australia sign pact to fight violent extremism"	"Asean and Australia signed a pact to cooperate on fighting violent extremism and terrorism financing yesterday, as Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull warned that terrorists are using digital technology in innovative ways to finance, plan and conduct their attacks. Under the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), Asean and Australia will work together to develop and implement counter-terrorism legislation consistent with international standards and best practices. They will also start a workshop on using electronic evidence in the investigation and prosecution of terrorism and transnational crime. The agreement also paves the way for exchange programmes for financial intelligence analysts and regional forums for Asean and Australian law enforcement agencies. The MOU comes at a time when terrorists increasingly use non-conventional funding methods, including digital currencies, stored value cards and crowdfunding platforms, making it harder to detect terrorism financing, Mr Turnbull noted. It has also become more critical than ever for countries to work together to counter terrorism, as the front line in the battle against this scourge is - in an interconnected world - everywhere, he added. ""We have seen... very, very graphically, where detailed instructions about the preparation of a weapon were transmitted over encrypted applications from Syria to an individual here in Australia,"" he said. ""So we have to be constantly alert, constantly working with our neighbours in the region."" He was speaking at a counter-terrorism conference, where the MOU was signed by Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop and Asean Secretary-General Lim Jock Hoi. The conference took place on the sidelines of the Asean-Australia Special Summit. Mr Turnbull and Asean leaders, including Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, witnessed the signing. Speaking on behalf of Asean leaders, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak urged leaders to fight terrorism on social media. ""This is our new main battleground - to win the hearts and minds of our youth through social media so that they do not easily succumb to the warped, perverse and evil ideology of Daesh,"" he said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Earlier in the day, Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton warned the conference that the use of encrypted messaging apps to plan terror attacks is the greatest threat faced by intelligence agencies. The use of the ""dark web"" by extremists and other criminals is a spiralling problem, he said, referring to the murky back alleys of the Internet, including chat apps, where criminals sell weapons and drugs. ""It would be a mistake to approach the problem from a purely national perspective,"" he said, urging a united and cohesive response. Australian ministers announced various other plans yesterday aimed at boosting ties with Asean, including a new Asean-Australia Infrastructure Skills Dialogue to address the skills challenges both sides face. Mr Turnbull also announced at a CEO Forum a A$30 million (S$30.5 million) investment fund to support smart cities. The initiative will set up a knowledge bank of sustainable urban planning ideas to be shared between Asean and Australia. Separately, Mr Lee attended a reception for overseas Singaporeans yesterday with his wife Ho Ching and Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan. Mr Lee said the bilateral relationship is a very ""intense engagement and connection"", with exchanges on many levels. Some 300 Singaporeans living in Sydney packed the Shangri-La Hotel's Grand Ballroom to meet them. "	Terrorism	Terrorism
Asean and Australia sign deal to combat terrorism together	"SYDNEY - Asean and Australia signed an agreement to cooperate on fighting violent extremism and terrorism financing on Saturday (March 17), as Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull warned that terrorists are using digital technology in innovative ways to finance, plan and conduct their attacks.

"US tags Maute IS ally, blocks terror funding"	" THE United States added the Maute group as an affiliate of the Islamic State in its list of foreign terrorist organizations, a move that Malacañang welcomed Wednesday. Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque said the US action reaffirmed the government’s long-held belief that the Maute group, which overran Marawi City last year, was composed of local terrorists aided by foreign extremists. The US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control on Tuesday included Maute group along with Abu Musab Al-Barnawi of Nigeria and Mahad Moalim of Somalia, and seven groups from Bangladesh, Egypt, Somalia, Nigeria and Tunisia to its sanction list. “This likewise recognizes the decisive action we have taken in liberating Marawi from these terrorists, which resulted in the success of the government in thwarting the establishment of an Islamic caliphate in the area and the containing of the rebellion from spreading to other parts of the Philippines,” Roque added. It took five months for the military and police to retake Marawi City, in fighting that left more than 1,100 people dead and that sparked fears that ISIS would gain a foothold in Southeast Asia. “Terrorism, indeed, knows no borders and the inclusion of the Maute group in the list of specially designated global terrorists and foreign terrorist organizations as an affiliate group of ISIS shows the solidarity and resolve of the international community to flush out evil forces to make the world safe and secure,” the statement added.A Defense department official said the inclusion of the Maute group in the list of global terrorist groups would also fortify efforts to track and freeze foreign funding from international organizations. This, said Defense spokesman Arsenio Andolong, would stop foreign groups from providing logistical support for local terrorists. “Such declaration from foreign countries will of course invariably help us in many ways in our fight against local terrorist and their foreign cohorts,” Andolong said. Armed Forces spokesman Brig. Gen. Bienvenido Datuin Jr. said the inclusion of the Maute group would make it easier to check money trails, financial sources, logistics lines and conduits of terror groups in foreign countries that may have connections with local violent extremists, he added. The US declaration comes in the wake of reports that 40 foreign fighters had slipped into Mindanao. Foreign financial aid to the Lanao-based Maute terror group will become more constricted with the United States’ official tagging of the group as a terrorist organization, officials said Wednesday."

"‘Resist all temptation; don’t let me down,’ Dela Rosa tells SAF troopers"	" Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa on Wednesday urged the the newest batch of the elite Special Action Force (SAF) troopers assigned at the New Bilibid Prison (NBP) in Muntinlupa City to “resist all forms of temptation” and stop the proliferation of illegal drugs there. “You are the SAF. You are the best of the best, the cream of the crop. Don’t let me down because you are my last hope to stop the proliferation of illegal drug trade inside the Bilibid,” he said. “If you fail, I don’t have anybody else to turn to. That’s why you have to resist the temptations, the bribes because you are not facing ordinary criminals. They are geniuses with evil minds,” he added. The new battalion, headed by Chief Superintendent Christopher Mendoza who is a Marawi siege veteran, will replace at least 300 SAF commandos guarding the NBP’s maximum security compound and Building 14 where criminals who have committed the most heinous crimes are detained. Dela Rosa also belied the allegations that the outgoing SAF troops were involved in any illegal activities with the inmates. He expressed confidence that the new battalion will be just as successful in their mission since most of them are Marawi survivors. “You have seen the worst. Everyday you had to face death doon sa Marawi and I’m very proud na napagtagumpayan niyo ‘yun. Tinalo niyo yung ISIS sa Marawi ito pa kaya?” Dela Rosa stated. However, Dela Rosa noted the “new players” who have entered the illegal drug trade inside the medium security compound. The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) said that newly-convicted Chinese drug lords have become the new players of the illegal drug trade inside the NBP. He said he will be willing to deploy additional more forces if the need arises. The maximum security compound currently houses 18,000 high-profile inmates while the medium security compound has 6,000 detainees. The Building 14 has about 100 inmates. The new batch of SAF troops will be the fourth to guard the NBP. It was on July 20, 2016 when the first batch of SAF troopers were deployed to the NBP to stop the proliferation of illegal drugs there."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Death toll rises to 18 in Crimea college blast	"""It's a colossal tragedy, 18 people died, and 40 more injured, for the time being,"" Aksyonov told Rossiya 24 channel, after authorities earlier said 50 people were injured. A student carried out the attack and shot himself, according to the leader of the Russian-annexed peninsula Sergei Askyonov. Most of those killed or wounded are teenagers. Russia's Investigative Committee, which probes major incidents, said it had ""opened a criminal case into a terrorist attack"" after an ""unidentified explosive device"" went off in the polytechnical college in Kerch city. Investigators said the explosive device went off in the college's canteen and that it was ""packed with metal objects."" ""Currently we know of 13 dead and around 50 injured,"" Investigative Committee spokeswoman Svetlana Petrenko earlier said in televised comments. The ""most of the (victims) are teenagers,"" the committee said. The college's website says it accepts students in the last three grades of school, from the age of 14. An unnamed witness who worked nearby said in a video on Kerch.tv website victims ""were taken away in public transport, in minibuses and buses, with 2 or 3 people in each ambulance."" ""They are children and staff,"" the witness said. ""I saw people without legs, without arms."" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said President Vladimir Putin had been informed of the ""tragic news"" from Kerch and that he ""expresses deep condolences to those who lost relatives and loved ones."" Crimean leader Sergei Aksyonov said on Facebook he had gone to the scene and ""all the necessary services are working at the scene of the incident."" The emergency services ministry said that it had flown out three helicopters and a plane with rescuers. Kerch is linked to the Russian mainland by a bridge opened by Putin in May this year."

Nearly 100 killed in ambulance blast in Afghan capital Kabul	" KABUL, Jan 28 — A bomb hidden in an ambulance killed at least 95 people and wounded about 158 in the Afghan capital Kabul yesterday when it blew up at a police checkpoint in a busy part of the city that was crowded with pedestrians. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the suicide blast, a week after they claimed an attack on the Intercontinental Hotel in which more than 20 people were killed. An interior ministry spokesman blamed the Haqqani network, a militant group affiliated with the Taliban which Afghan and Western officials consider to be behind many of the biggest attacks on urban targets in Afghanistan. As medical teams struggled to handle the casualties pouring in, some of the wounded were laid out in the open, with intravenous drips set up next to them in hospital gardens. “It's a massacre,” said Dejan Panic, coordinator in Afghanistan for the Italian aid group Emergency, which runs a nearby trauma hospital that treated dozens of wounded. Hours after the blast, a health ministry spokesman said the casualty toll had risen to at least 95 killed and 158 wounded. Yesterday's explosion capped a violent week in Afghanistan, with the siege at the Intercontinental Hotel and another attack on an office of the aid group Save the Children in the eastern city of Jalalabad. That attack was claimed by Islamic State. The wave of attacks has put pressure on President Ashraf Ghani and his US allies, who have expressed growing confidence that a new more aggressive military strategy has succeeded in driving Taliban insurgents back from major provincial centres. The United States has stepped up its assistance to Afghan security forces and increased its air strikes against the Taliban and other militant groups, aiming to break a stalemate and force the insurgents to the negotiating table. However, the Taliban have dismissed suggestions they have been weakened by the new strategy, and the past week has shown their capacity to mount deadly, high-profile attacks is undiminished, even in the heavily protected centre of Kabul. Washington, which has accused Pakistan of giving assistance to the Taliban and has cut off some aid to Islamabad, urged all countries to take ""decisive action"" to stop the violence. “There can be no tolerance for those who support or offer sanctuary to terrorist groups,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement. Pakistan, which denies the accusations, condemned the attack and called for ""concerted efforts and effective cooperation among the states to eradicate the scourge of terrorism."" Yesterday is a working day in Afghanistan and the streets were full when the blast went off at around lunchtime in a busy part of the city close to shops and markets and near a number of foreign embassies and government buildings. Mirwais Yasini, a member of parliament who was near the blast, said an ambulance approached the checkpoint and blew up, having passed through another checkpoint further down the road. The target was apparently an Interior Ministry building but the victims were mainly people who happened to be in the street. Buildings hundreds of metres (yards) away were shaken by the force of the blast, which left torn bodies strewn on the street amid piles of rubble, debris and wrecked cars. “Today's attack is nothing short of an atrocity,” Tadamichi Yamamoto, head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, said in a statement, adding that those behind it must be brought to justice. The casualty toll is the worst since 150 people were killed in a huge truck bomb explosion last May near the German embassy. That attack prompted a major reinforcement of security aimed at preventing similar vehicle-borne assaults. Security officials said further attacks were likely and security was tightened around potential targets in the city. But with much of central Kabul already a heavily fortified zone of high concrete blast walls and police checkpoints, there were angry questions about how the bomber got through. “Officials must be held responsible,” said former deputy Interior Minister Mohammad Ayub Salangi. People helped walking-wounded away as ambulances with sirens wailed through the traffic-clogged streets of the city centre. “I was sitting in the office when the explosion went off,” said Alam, an office worker whose head was badly cut in the blast. “All the windows shattered, the building collapsed and everything came down.” The Swedish and Dutch embassies as well as the European Union mission and an Indian consular office are also nearby but there were no reports that any staff were hurt."

Cafe blast kills pro-Moscow rebel leader in east Ukraine	" MOSCOW/KIEV (REUTERS) - The leader of Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine was killed on Friday (Aug 31) in a blast at a cafe in Donetsk city, the separatist administration said. Russia's foreign ministry accused Ukraine of assassinating the separatist leader, Alexander Zakharchenko, to try to unleash a renewed war in eastern Ukraine, but Kiev said it had nothing to do with the blast and blamed separatist infighting. Russian President Vladimir Putin called the killing a""dastardly"" crime aimed at destabilising a fragile regional peace, but he did not accuse Kiev of being behind it. Zakharchenko, who led the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic since 2014, ""received injuries incompatible with life as a result of an explosion in the centre of Donetsk,"" the separatist administration said in a statement. Russian-backed rebels threw off Ukrainian central rule in an armed uprising after pro-Western leaders opposed by Moscow came to power in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, in 2014. A shaky internationally-brokered ceasefire has been in force since 2015, halting large-scale fighting, though there are still frequent outbreaks of shooting on the front line between the separatist and Ukrainian forces. In a telegram of condolences released by the Kremlin, Putin praised Zakharchenko as a true popular leader and a patriot. ""The dastardly killing of Alexander Zakharchenko is further evidence: those who have chosen the path of terror, violence and spreading fear do not want to seek a peaceful political solution to the conflict,"" the telegram said. ""They are placing a dangerous bet on destabilising the situation,"" Putin said, without specifying who those people were. Russia's Foreign Ministry had every reason to believe Kiev was responsible for Zakharchenko's death, ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on the Rossiya-24 state television station. Russia's Investigative Committee, the state body that handles major crimes, said it was treating the killing as an act of international terrorism. In Kiev, a spokeswoman for the state Security Service, Yelena Gitlyanskaya, dismissed Moscow's accusations, saying the killing was a result of years-long ""internal fighting... between the terrorists and their Russian sponsors"". Zakharchenko, a 42-year-old former coalmine electrician, became leader of the Donetsk Republic in November 2014. Other rebel leaders say he was handpicked for the role by Moscow. A vote held by separatists confirmed him in office. The separatists have been dogged by infighting that has, on occasion, turned violent. Several past leaders of the separatists have fled the region, saying they feared for their lives after their comrades turned on them. Earlier this year, three sources who led the original uprising in 2014 told Reuters they expected Zakharchenko to be pushed aside, with Moscow's assistance, and that a new rebel leadership would take over. In the past, at least five other leading separatist commanders have been killed in unexplained circumstances not connected to front-line combat. Separatist officials blamed Ukraine for those deaths, while Kiev - and some separatists speaking on condition of anonymity - said in some cases the commanders were killed in internal purges. Among those killed was Arseny Pavlov, who went by the nom de guerre ""Motorola"" and was blown up in the lift of his apartment building in Donetsk in October 2016. Another prominent casualty was Alexander Bednov, nicknamed""Batman,"" a senior commander in the Luhansk People's Republic, another eastern Ukrainian breakaway region that neighbours Donetsk. He was killed in January 2015 when his convoy came under fire in a location where, at the time, there was no fighting with Ukrainian forces. A source close to the Donetsk separatist leadership, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters on Friday that Denis Pushilin, head of the rebel legislature, was likely to become caretaker leader of the region. The separatist administration, in its statement, said the blast that killed Zakharchenko also injured the deputy prime minister of the self-proclaimed republic, Alexander Timofeyev."

Terrorist attack' kills six Tunisia security forces	" TUNIS, July 9 — Six members of Tunisia's security forces were killed yesterday in a “terrorist attack” near the border with Algeria, the interior ministry said, the country's deadliest such incident in over two years. The attack comes as Tunisia is hoping for its best tourist season since a spate of jihadist attacks in 2015 sent visitor numbers plunging. A national guard border patrol in the Ain Sultan area of the Jenduba border province “was hit in a landmine ambush that killed six agents” at 11.45am (1045 GMT), the ministry said in a statement. Ministry spokesman General Sufyan al-Zaq said the blast was a “terrorist attack” and that assailants had “opened fire on security forces” after the mine exploded. “Combing operations” were underway, said Zaq, who had earlier told AFP that eight guards were killed in the attack. No group has claimed the attack, which took place in a mountainous border area where the Al-Qaeda-linked Okba Ibn Nafaa Battalion and the Tunisian branch of the Islamic State group, Jund al-Khilafa (Soldiers of the Caliphate), are active. “We are aware that the war on terrorism will be long,” interim Interior Minister Ghazi Jeribi said on state TV, adding that three security forces were also wounded in the attack. “We will go into their (the terrorists) dens and we will avenge the Tunisian people,” said Jeribi, who was ordered to go to Jenduba. The attack is likely to exacerbate an ongoing political crisis in Tunisia, where Prime Minister Youssef Chahed, who recently fired the previous interior minister, is facing heat from his own allies. There are regular attacks along the Algerian border, but this was the first time in two years security forces suffered such a loss. Yesterday's assault marks the bloodiest attack in Tunisia since a March 2016 attack on security installations in the town of Ben Guerdane on the Libyan border. That attack killed 13 security forces and seven civilians. Tunisia's tourism industry is still rebounding from a string of devastating attacks in 2015, including one at the National Bardo museum in Tunis and another targeting a beach resort in Sousse that together killed 59 foreign tourists and a Tunisian guard. In May, Tourism Minister Selma Elloumi Rekik said the industry had made a “real recovery.” ""People are coming back to Tunisia because there is security ... we are at the same level (of security) as any European city,"" she said. Since the 2011 uprising that toppled dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, jihadist attacks in Tunisia have killed dozens of members of the security forces and foreign tourists. Since Ben Ali's fall, “at least 127 militants and 118 soldiers, national guardsmen, and police officers have been killed in the northwest,” according to figures compiled by analyst Matt Herbert and published in June by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “This new attack shows that there are still pockets where security problems have not been solved,” he told AFP on Sunday, while stressing “the vast majority of Tunisia remains safe.” The country has been under a state of emergency since November 2015, when an IS-claimed suicide bombing in Tunis killed 12 presidential guards."

Blast at Indian restaurant in Canada injures 15: Police	"Canadian police on Friday hunted two men after a blast at an Indian restaurant near Toronto injured 15 people, but police said there were no initial signs of terrorism. An improvised device detonated Thursday night at the eatery in Mississauga, a major suburb west of Toronto, while two parties celebrated birthdays, Peel Regional Police Chief Jennifer Evans told a news conference. ""Two men wearing hoodies were seen entering the restaurant with an IED,"" or improvised device, she said. ""The men were seen fleeing the scene immediately following the explosion."" The men did not say anything, just dropped off the device and left, authorities said earlier. ""Every police resource is being used right now to locate the people responsible for this horrendous act,"" Evans added, giving the number of injured as 15. Three of them -- a 35-year-old man and two women, aged 48 and 62 -- were taken by ambulance to hospital in critical condition, and were listed as stable on Friday morning. Other victims were treated for minor injuries after the blast at the Bombay Bhel restaurant. ""This is a heinous crime,"" Mississauga Mayor Bonnie Crombie said. So far there is ""no indication this is a terrorist act, no indication this is a hate crime,"" said police chief Evans, who added: ""We haven't ruled anything out as we start our investigation."" The Toronto metropolitan area has a sizeable population with Indian origins."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Suicide blast targeting police kills seven in Pakistan’s Lahore	"LAHORE, March 15 — A suicide bomb blast claimed by the Taliban ripped through a police checkpoint on the outskirts of the Pakistani city of Lahore yesterday, killing seven people and wounding 18, officials said. Jam Sajjad Hussain, spokesman of a state-run rescue service, told Reuters that his officials had taken seven dead bodies to hospitals. “Our rescuers are at work,” he said. “They have shifted so far seven bodies.” Deputy Inspector General of police Haider Ashraf said the bomb exploded when the police were changing guards at the checkpoint just outside an annual religious congregation in Raiwind, where nearly 80,000 people were in attendance. “A suicide bomber riding a motorcycle attacked the police,” Ashraf said. He said four of the dead were police. A Pakistani Taliban spokesman Mohammad Khurasani claimed responsibility for the suicide attack in a WhatsApp message sent to a Reuters reporter. Lahore is considered a cultural hub of the nuclear-armed nation of over 208 million people where Islamist militants have been fighting for over a decade against the state in a bid to install their own harsh brand of Islamic governance. Located in the east of the country, Lahore has largely been spared the militant violence seen in the country’s northwest which sits at the edge of a lawless mountain range along the Afghan border. That area has long been home to local and foreign Islamist militants from the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, and where Islamic State has lately made footholds. The Pakistani Taliban leadership have fled to neighbouring Afghanistan from where Islamabad alleges they plan and execute terrorist attacks inside Pakistan. Washington today offered a US$5 million (RM19.5 million) bounty for the Pakistani Taliban militant leader, Mulllah Fazlullah, a day after a suspected US drone strike on a training camp in a remote part of Afghanistan killed his son and more than 20 other militants preparing to launch suicide attacks in Pakistan. The US cooperation comes amid worsening US-Pakistan relations, and coincided with a visit to Washington by Pakistan’s foreign secretary for talks expected to focus on boosting counter-terrorism cooperation and the US strategy in Afghanistan.

"One dead, one hurt in blast outside Stockholm area metro"	"STOCKHOLM, Jan 8 — One person died and another was slightly hurt yesterday in a blast outside a metro station in a Stockholm suburb, which police said did not appear to be a terrorist attack. A man in his 60s died in hospital after “he picked up an object off the ground which promptly exploded,” police spokesman Sven-Erik Olsson told AFP. A woman aged 45 was also hurt, suffering facial injuries, police said. The blast occurred mid-morning at the Varby gard station in Huddinge, a southern suburb of the Swedish capital. Police cordoned off the station and the square where the blast happened as the bomb squad moved in to investigate. The Expressen and Aftonbladet newspapers said the device was a hand grenade. “It is too early to say. Technicians are still working on it. Nothing indicates that the (injured) couple were targeted,” said Olsson, adding there was nothing to suggest an act of terrorism. Local resident Milorad Jencic told AFP he was shocked as witnesses and onlookers gathered around the police cordon. “We had incidents in the 1990s and early 2000s. There were very violent gangs” at the time, he said, adding he was “surprised” by this blast because he thought those groups had since disappeared. According to a Swedish police report published last year, Sweden is the European country where criminal gangs use the most grenades, often from stocks from the former Yugoslavia. In August 2016, an eight-year-old boy was killed by a grenade thrown into a flat in a working-class area of Gothenburg."	Terrorism	Terrorism

""People are coming back to Tunisia because there is security ... we are at the same level (of security) as any European city,"" she said. Since the 2011 uprising that toppled dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, jihadist attacks in Tunisia have killed dozens of members of the security forces and foreign tourists. Since Ben Ali's fall, ""at least 127 militants and 118 soldiers, national guardsmen, and police officers have been killed in the northwest"", according to figures compiled by analyst Matt Herbert and published in June by the Carnegie Endownment for International Peace. ""This new attack shows that there are still pockets where security problems have not been solved,"" he told AFP on Sunday, while stressing ""the vast majority of Tunisia remains safe"". The country has been under a state of emergency since November 2015, when an IS-claimed suicide bombing in Tunis killed 12 presidential guards."	Terrorism	Terrorism
" Deadly blast hits eastern Afghan city, targeting Sikh minority"	"JALALABAD, AFGHANISTAN (REUTERS) - An explosion hit the centre of the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad on Sunday (July 1), killing at least 20 people, including several members of the small Sikh minority, provincial government officials said. The blast, hours after President Ashraf Ghani had opened a hospital in Jalalabad, damaged shops and buildings around Mukhaberat square in the city, governor's spokesman Attaullah Khogyani said. A politician representing the minority Sikh community was killed in the blast. Officials said Awtar Singh Khalsa, who had planned to stand in October's parliamentary elections, was dead. Ghulam Sanayi Stanekzai, police chief of Nangarhar, said the explosion was caused by a suicide bomber who targeted a vehicle carrying members of the Sikh minority who were travelling to meet the president. Islamic State claimed the attack in a statement via its online Amaq news agency, but provided no evidence for the claim. Officials said at least 10 of the dead were Sikhs. Afghanistan is an overwhelmingly Muslim nation but a small number of Hindus and Sikhs remain in the country. One seat in the Afghan parliament is reserved for a member of the country's small Sikh and Hindu communities. But increasing numbers of Sikhs and Hindus have moved to India, their spiritual homeland, due to persecution and repeated threats. Officials at the Indian Embassy in Kabul confirmed the death of ten Sikhs and condemned ""the terrorist attack"" in Jalalabad. ""The attack underlines the need for a united global fight against international terrorism without discrimination and accountability of those who support terrorists in any manner,""the Indian Embassy said on Twitter. Inaamullah Miakhel, a spokesman for the provincial health department of Nangarhar, said 20 people were wounded. Officials said the casualty total might have been even higher had much of the city not been blocked off for Ghani's visit. He was not in the area when the blast occurred. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast, the latest in a series to have hit Jalalabad, the provincial capital of Nangarhar, where Islamic State fighters have established a strong presence in recent years. The attack underlined the fragile security situation in Afghanistan after last month's brief ceasefire between government forces and the Taliban. The three-day truce did not include Islamic State, which fights both government forces and the Taliban and which has shown no sign of letting up its campaign of violence."	Terrorism	Terrorism
 Police search for motive after 49 hurt in Zimbabwe election blast	" HARARE (REUTERS) - Police said on Sunday (June 24) they were searching for a motive for an explosion at Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa's election rally that injured 49 people. Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, the general who led a de facto coup that forced long-time leader Robert Mugabe to resign in November, described Saturday's (June 23) blast as a ""terrorist act"" that would not stop the July 30 presidential, parliamentary and local elections, Zimbabwe's first post-Mugabe vote. ""The police will hunt down the criminals. They will be hunted down and they will be brought before the law,"" Chiwenga told a campaign rally of the ruling ZANU-PF party in the town of Chitungwiza, 30 km (20 miles) south of the capital Harare. Mugabe has said he felt betrayed by Mnangagwa, his former protege, and has called his presidency illegal. Mnangagwa, 75, and Nelson Chamisa, 40, the leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, are the main contenders in next month's vote. Chiwenga's wife was among those injured and police said the toll could rise as more people came forward. National police spokeswoman Charity Charamba said police were pursuing leads after the blast at a stadium in Bulawayo, the opposition heartland where ZANU-PF has lost all national elections since 2000. Mnangagwa escaped injury. Charamba told reporters a ""substantial reward"" was being offered for information. She did not give details. It was not clear who was responsible for the explosion, which Mnangagwa called a cowardly act, or how the security around the president was breached. Mnangagwa adopted most of Mugabe's security and bureaucratic system, fearing a complete overhaul, which the military had sought, could cause government instability and cost him votes. As internal security minister at independence in 1980, Mnangagwa built the system that protected Mugabe, but as tensions rose over who would succeed the 94-year-old, it broke into factions. Without mentioning names, Mnangagwa said there were some people who did not accept his presidency and his ""usual enemies""were behind the blast. Two sources close to Mnangagwa said some Mugabe loyalists in the security and government establishment were ""hurting"" over the November coup. ""You cannot say this is a terrorist act and neither can you say it was done by state actors who want to take power. These are people who are hurting, who want to harm the president and they have access,"" one of the sources told Reuters, declining to be named. South African President Cyril Rampahosa condemned the attack and said the regional Southern African Development Community would ""evaluate the incident and appropriate steps."" Among Zimbabwe's small but vibrant Twitter and Facebook communities, people posted theories, including accusations this was an inside job meant to gain sympathy votes in an opposition stronghold. Hasnain Malik, global head of equity research at Exotix Capital said Saturday's incident could have been a result of tensions within Mnangagwa's government. ""There are two long-standing tensions in Zimbabwe: First, within ZANU-PF, between Mnangagwa's Lacoste faction and Mugabe's G40 factions, with an undertone of tribal tension,"" Malik said in a note to investors."

Israeli army: Palestinian killed in Gaza border fence blast	"GAZA CITY, July 19 — A Palestinian was killed yesterday when a part of Israel’s fortifications on the Gaza border blew up as he tampered with it, the Israeli military said. The 24-year-old man’s death in northern Gaza followed a more than two-month surge in tensions along the frontier, where Israeli troops have killed at least 125 Palestinians during sometimes violent mass demonstrations. Residents said the man killed in the blast was among a group of Palestinians who approached the border fence, drawing fire from soldiers on the other side. An Israeli military statement described them as “five terrorists who tried to sabotage the (border) security infrastructure”. “The security infrastructure exploded, and as a result of that, there were casualties among the terrorists,” it said. Military spokesmen declined to elaborate on the blast or say whether Israel had employed a new counter-measure against incursions. Since its last war with Gaza’s dominant Hamas Islamists in 2014, Israel has stepped up efforts to prevent cross-border attacks, improving rocket interceptors and investing in technologies for detecting and destroying guerrilla tunnels. Faced with international censure over its use of live fire in the fence protests, Israel says troops have been holding off border breaches and responding to gunmen who tried to use civilians as cover for attacks on them. There have been no serious Israeli casualties in the confrontations since the so-called “Great March of Return” was launched on March 30 to press for what Palestinians see as their right to lands lost to Israel during the 1948 war of its founding. But incendiary materials flown in from Gaza by kites or helium balloons have destroyed swathes of farmland and forests, and killed wildlife. In what the military described as a response to the blazes, Israeli jets struck nine Hamas targets in northern Gaza yesterday. Sirens sounded in outlying Israeli areas and the military said three rockets had been launched towards Israeli territory but one fell short in Gaza. “These are terrorist acts that endanger Israeli residents living in southern Israel and damage extensive areas in Israeli territory,” a military statement said of the kites and balloons. There were no casualties in the air strikes or rocket launches. Israel has drafted in civilian drone enthusiasts as army reservists, instructing them to fly their remote-controlled aircraft into the kites, an Israeli general said, but an effective means to stop the kites has yet to be found. Around two million people live in Gaza, most of them the descendants of refugees from what is now Israel. The territory has been controlled by Hamas for more than a decade, during which it has fought three wars against Israel. Israel and Egypt maintain a blockade of the strip, citing security reasons, which has caused an economic crisis and collapse in living standards there over the past decade"	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Alleged Tangerang terrorist always neat and well behaved, say neighbors"	"Muhammad Choir, 32, the man the National Police’s Densus 88 counterterrorism squad arrested on Wednesday for his alleged involvement in a terror group, always looked neat and relaxed in public, a neighbor has said. The neighbor, who identified herself only as Vera, said that Muhammad often took a morning walk around their neighborhood on Jl. Gempol Raya, Tangerang, wearing a T-shirt and shorts. It was only on Friday that Muhammad, who had a thin beard, wore a loose tunic or gamis. According to the tempo.co report, Vera said she knew Muhammad as a tailor who made school uniforms, sports attire and Islamic dress. “He received a lot of orders, especially for early childhood school [PAUD] uniforms. His customers were mostly women,” Vera said on Wednesday as quoted by tempo.co. Another neighbor, Midah, 43, said Muhammad was a nice neighbor that he called “Om Choir”, or ""Uncle Choir"". “When he went back to his hometown in Medan, he bought me coffee as a gift. When he went to Sukabumi, Om Choir brought me mochi,” she said. Sukabumi is the hometown of Choir’s wife, whom he married three months ago. Choir lived in a rental house for about a year, paying annual rent of about Rp 10 million (US$710.64). Choir only had one employee, identified only as G, who was nicknamed Ujang and also arrested on Wednesday. “I don’t know their real names. I called them Om Choir, Ujang and Teteh (a common Sundanese title meaning ""elder sister"") for [Choir’s] wife,” said Midah. On Wednesday, Densus 88 personnel raided several locations on Jl. Gempol in Pinang and on Jl. Kunciran Indah, which is located about 1 kilometer from Jl. Gempol. They arrested Muhammad, G and another man identified as A who were allegedly involved in a terrorist group. Muhammad’s wife was also detained as a witness. National Police spokesperson Insp. Gen. Setyo Waseso said they suspected the group was part of the Jakarta branch of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), a local group that has pledged allegiance to Islamic State (IS)."	Terrorism	Terrorism
" Blast destroys shop and home in Leicester, five taken to hospital"	"LONDON, Feb 26 — An explosion destroyed a convenience store and a home in the central English city of Leicester yesterday, injuring at least five people, officials said. British police said there was no immediate indication that the explosion was linked to terrorism. Pictures and videos posted on Twitter showed flames leaping into the sky from the site which was reduced to rubble. “All emergency services are currently dealing with this,” the police force said in a statement. Later it said the blast was being investigated with the fire service. “At this stage there is no indication this is terrorist related,” Leicestershire police said. A local hospital said four patients were in a critical condition and fifth person had also been brought in for treatment by police. A photograph published by the Leicester Mercury newspaper showed a blaze and the rubble of a destroyed building which the newspaper said housed a convenience store and a flat above it. “We heard an absolutely massive explosion. It was pretty frightening,” the Mercury quoted an unidentified resident, who lives a few streets away, as saying. “We went to look out of the upstairs windows and saw loads of smoke, and then a few seconds later massive orange flames.” The city’s fire department said it sent six fire engines after the reports of a large explosion and a building collapse. The Leicester Mercury said debris had been blown across the road in front of the site. Police said a number of other buildings were damaged and homes and businesses in the area had been evacuated."

Ayob Khan: Police repatriated 30 terrorist suspects since 2014	" PUTRAJAYA, Jan 5 — The Royal Malaysia Police (RMP) repatriated about 30 of the 50 suspected terrorists sent to Malaysia since 2014, said Bukit Aman Special Branch Counter Terrorism Division Principal Assistant Director Datuk Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay. He said the suspects were sent to this country following their detention in various countries which he declined to name. According to international law, suspected terrorists detained in any country should be repatriated to their last port of embarkation, instead of the country that they wanted to go to, he added. “If the suspect was detained in Dubai, for instance, then the suspect must be repatriated to Dubai and not Malaysia. If you ask him where he wants to go, of course he will say Malaysia because we are open, and they don’t need visa to come here,” he told reporters after delivering his talk at the Putrajaya International Security Dialogue (PISD) 2018 here today. Ayob Khan said most of those repatriated were Daesh terrorist suspects of various nationalities, the majority of whom were Arabs. He also said some countries should share early information with Malaysia on the movements of terrorist suspects to facilitate the Malaysian police to take action against them, including monitoring, detaining and sending them to their countries of origin. “We need intelligence sharing, if not, how can we detect any terrorist suspect?,” he asked. He said the Malaysian Government and the RMP were constantly working to enhance cooperation with other countries to address problems related to the repatriation of terrorist suspects. Previously, Reuters reported that Turkish authorities deported militant suspects to Kuala Lumpur without any prior notice after they were arrested while trying to enter Syria to join the Daesh group of militants. Ayob Khan said 105 Daesh terrorist suspects had been detained last year, slightly lower than 119 arrested in 2016. Commenting on the two-day PISD themed ‘Wisdom and Moderation in Combating Terrorism’, he said the dialogue was organised by the Home Ministry in collaboration with Rabitah Al-Alami Al-Islami (the Muslim World League), a non-governmental organisation based in Saudi Arabia."

AFP intensifies conduct of checkpoints in Isulan another blast rocked Sultan Kudarat	"The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) on Tuesday said that it has intensified the conduct of checkpoints in Isulan, Sultan Kudarat following another blast that rocked the town Sunday night. In a statement, AFP Spokesman Col. Edgard Arevalo, said military units on the ground have further intensified the conduct of checkpoints in all of the town’s entry and exit points to prevent terrorists from again placing IEDs (improvise explosive device). “We have stepped up further patrols and intelligence efforts,” Arevalo said. “We have (also) alerted our troops to augment PNP (Philippine National Police) efforts in the now ensuing police manhunt operations,” he added. Arevalo said the AFP condemns in the strongest terms possible the cowardly attack that targeted innocent civilians. He said the perpetrators’ means of assaulting hapless victims through terror, death and destruction do not justify their ideals. With this in mind, Arevalo assured that government security forces will address these vile aggressions with vehement counteractions and with the support of the community, they will get those criminals. “(Also) with the help of the local residents, we can potentially prevent any repeat (of the incident),” he said. Arevalo said the local government of Isulan led by Mayor Marites Palasigue and the PNP are leading the efforts to hunt down the perpetrators behind the incident. He added that the AFP extend its sincerest condolences to the victims of the bombing and assure their families that the AFP is one with them in their quest for justice. Two persons perished while 14 others were wounded — three of them critically — as a result of the explosion. “We continue to call on the public to help suppress this twin terrorist attacks since the targets are civilians. While government security forces were not stopping to arrest the criminals, justice will be more swiftly served to the victims if the people will be with us in this fight by discreetly reporting the whereabouts of these terrorists,” Arevalo said. Arevalo said the AFP is urging communities to unite in these attacks by terrorists targeting the lives of people, their freedom of movement, and the peace in the towns and cities. “We urge every individual—every man or woman, young or old— to be vigilant and actively involved in reporting their observation of any suspicious activities or persons in their localities,” Arevalo said. “Only with that unity of our communities; only with that degree of vigilance and participation of our people combined with the diligent and dedicated government security forces can we as a nation triumph over these terrorists,” he said. The Army’s 6th Infantry Division (6th ID) said they are looking at the possibility that the Daesh-inspired group under Esmael Abdulmalik alias Abu Toraife/Toraype, was behind the blast. In an interview, AFP 6th ID spokesman Capt. Arvin Encinas said Sunday night’s bombing in Isulan town, Sultan Kudarat was perpetrated by the faction under Abdulmalik, an influential cleric and skilled bomb expert, said to be involved in previous bombings in Maguindanao. He said their main purpose is to sow terror and create fear in the community. The group’s areas of operations are in Maguindanao and Sultan Kudarat. “Itong pagpapasabog eh part ng retaliation nila as they suffered significant losses during our FMO (focus military operations),” Encinas said With regard to criticism by some that another bombing incident happened in Sultan Kudarat despite the implementation of martial law in Mindanao, Encinas said terrorism is a global issue that even the most advance countries are having a hard time dealing with. “Terrorism is a global issue, even the most advanced and developed countries ay nagkakaroon ng (also experience the) same incident,” Encinas said. “Security is not only the sole responsibility of the security forces, that is why we are asking support and vigilance of each and every one of us,” he added. Encinas, said the explosion caused by an IED (improvised explosive device), took place in an internet cafe adjacent to Novo Department Store in Kalawag 2, Isulan, Sultan Kudarat,.at about 7:30 p.m. Sunday. Army 6th Infantry Division chief Brig. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, said the explosion that hit Kalawag 2, is about 400 to 500 meters away where another IED exploded almost a week ago which claimed the lives of three people and wounded 34 others."

"Abu Sayyaf terrorist killed, 22 soldiers wounded in Sulu encounter"	"An Abu Sayyaf terrorist was killed while 22 soldiers were wounded following an encounter that took place in Patikul, Sulu on Thursday. A report coming from the Armed Forces of the Philippines-Western Mindanao Command (AFP-WestMinCom), identified the killed ASG terrorist as Alpata Abdurasa. On the other hand, 17 of the 22 soldiers wounded or battle casualties (batcas) sustained slight shrapnel wounds caused by M203 grenade launcher. three sustained gunshot wounds while the two others due to a 90RR back blast. The wounded troops were taken to Camp Teodulfo Bautista Station Hospital for medical attention. It was learned that operating troops of the Army’s 41st Infantry Battalion were on a combat operation when it encountered more or less 40 Abu Sayyaf Group members under ASG Sub-leader Idang Susukan and Ben Tattoo in Barangay Langhub, Patikul, Sulu at about 9:30 a.m. Thursday. The firefight lasted for 45 minutes afterwhich the enemy scampered to different directions bringing along with them their casualties.

As of press time, troops are still scouring the encounter site while other units are in pursuit against the local terrorist."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Rights groups condemn Kabul school blast as outrage grows	"Rights groups Thursday condemned a suicide blast inside a school that killed dozens of students in Kabul a day earlier, as outrage over the attack grew while tearful families buried loved ones in the war-weary Afghan capital. The Islamic State-claimed blast hit an education centre in a Shiite area of western Kabul where students were studying for college entrance exams. The attack was just one of the most shocking in a blood-soaked week across Afghanistan that has left security forces and civilians reeling. Two gunmen attacked an intelligence training centre in Kabul Thursday, firing on security forces for several hours before they were killed, police spokesman Hashmat Stanikzai said, adding that there were no other casualties. Thursday’s attack was also claimed by the Islamic State via their Amaq propaganda service. In addition to the IS attacks, Taliban militants also delivered high-profile, demoralising blows in the strategic city of Ghazni — which they attacked last week, forcing security forces backed by US air power to struggle for days to push them out — and in Faryab, where they captured a northern base, killing at least 17 soldiers. Security forces in Afghanistan, beset by desertions and killings, have suffered staggering losses since US-led NATO ended its combat mission in the country in 2014. The week’s violence has raised questions about their ability to hold off the resurgent Taliban. But civilians have long taken the brunt of the violence in Afghanistan — especially in Kabul, a target of both the Taliban and IS — and Wednesday’s attack on the school was branded a “war crime” by Amnesty International. The majority of the victims were children, most aged between 16 and 18, authorities said, and were studying for their university entrance exams. Amnesty warned it proved “beyond any doubt that Afghanistan and, in particular, its capital Kabul, are not safe”, and said European countries must stop returning Afghan refugees to the war-torn country. UNICEF, meanwhile, branded the attack “deplorable” and called for parties on all sides of the conflict to protect children. Outrage was also growing on social media, where Afghans condemned the attack and angrily denounced those behind it — as well as the government for failing to protect them. Facebook user Ramazan Ali Ramazan described the victims as an “asset” to the country. “Death and hatred to this government and filthy terrorist that everyday they are killing innocent Afghans,” he added. Families of the dead held a mass funeral Thursday where mourners wept and clutched the wooden coffins. An industrial-sized digger helped soften the arid ground for the fresh graves as men removed rocks from the soil with pickaxes. Mourners decried the unrelenting bloodshed, while others dismissed murmurings of possible ceasefires and peace negotiations between the government and the Taliban, even though the attack was claimed by IS. “Death to your ceasefire and death to your ghost peace talks,” cried one of the funeral attendees. “They are killing our educated people and every day they are killing us.” The surge in violence comes just weeks after Afghans marked an unprecedented country-wide ceasefire between the Taliban and government forces in June, offering temporary relief to civilians. The brief respite sparked hopes the truce could clear the way for talks to end the nearly 17-year-old conflict. However the devastating attacks across the country in recent days have led many to question how such negotiations could move ahead. “Everyday we are witnessing deadly attacks in Kabul and other major cities. So, I believe the Taliban do not believe in peace talks,” said shopkeeper Shahenshah Shahin in Kabul. Analysts have suggested the Taliban may be trying to shore up its position before any potential negotiations by proving they can hit government installations at will. “The Taliban will try to have an upper hand during talks, so we can’t rule out more attacks until a ceasefire,” said Taliban expert Rahimullah Yusufzai. “It’s the fighting season and the Taliban will want to rack up victories before winter.” The group has been conducting blistering attacks on security forces across Afghanistan, including the massive, days-long onslaught on Ghazni during the past week. Small pockets of Ghazni began opening up to humanitarian aid Thursday, while partial mobile service returned after telecommunications infrastructure and government buildings were destroyed during the onslaught. The UN has warned of unconfirmed reports suggesting up to 150 civilians might have been killed in the fighting. Militant attacks and suicide bombings were the leading causes of civilian deaths in the first half of 2018, according to a recent UN report."	Terrorism	Terrorism
 Military says BIFF rebels behind Sultan Kudarat blast	" ISULAN, SULTAN KUDARAT—The military on Monday blamed Sunday night’s bombing here that killed two people and wounded 12 others on a faction of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) that had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) jihadi group in the Middle East. Malacañang condemned the “dastardly attack,” the second in Isulan since August 28, when a bomb ripped through a row of used-clothes stores at Barangay Kalawag 3, killing three people and injuring 36 others. “We strongly denounce the latest attack in Isulan, Sultan Kudarat,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in a statement issued in Jerusalem, where President Duterte was on a four-day official visit. The August 28 bombing in Isulan was also blamed on the BIFF faction led by Abu Toraife. The police chief of Isulan, Supt. Celestino Danie, and the provincial police director, Senior Supt. Noel Kinazo, were sacked on Monday after the latest explosion. The death toll in Sunday night’s attack rose to two after the sister of the 18-year-old boy who was killed in the explosion that ripped through an internet café at Barangay Kalawag 2 died on Monday morning. Maria Lyn Luda, a cousin of Jan Mark Palencia Luda (not Lupa as earlier reported), died at the Sultan Kudarat provincial hospital, according to Supt. Aldrin Gonzales, spokesperson for the Police Regional Office 12. Isulan Mayor Marites Pallasigue called off classes at all levels in public and private schools as a security measure. Chief Supt. Eliseo Rasco, the regional police commander, announced the sacking of Danie and Kinazo on Monday morning, saying the order came from Philippine National Police Director General Oscar Albayalde, who was in Brunei attending a regional police conference. No one has claimed responsibility for Sunday night’s bombing, but Capt. Arvin John Encinas, spokesperson for the military in the region, said followers of Abu Toraife, leader of the BIFF faction that had pledged loyalty to IS, carried out the attack in retaliation against the military for air and ground operations in Maguindanao province that killed several fighters from the group. “They are losing men . . . that’s why they are resorting to bomb [attacks]. It’s part of their retaliation and to divert our concentration [from] them,” Encinas said. “Last night, we locked down the town as we hunted the perpetrators,” he added. Dave Bryan Leliza, 26, caretaker of the internet café, said on Monday that a male teenager carrying a paper bag arrived at 7:15 p.m. on Sunday and occupied cubicle No. 8. Leliza said the boy left after 10 minutes, and a man took the same cubicle. “Our [security cameras] recorded all these . . . [A camera] clearly showed the face of the [teenager who came in carrying a paper] bag,” he said, adding there were 15 customers at the time. Then, at 8:28 p.m., a blast tore through the internet café. “Our [computers] were flying, the ceiling falling, smoke billowing and everyone inside crying for help,” Leliza said. “I tried to help but realized I was hit in the legs and head,” he said. Leliza was one of the victims rushed to various hospitals. Doctors extracted fragments of floor tiles from his head and nails from his legs. Two of the victims, including Leliza, remained in critical condition at the hospital. Cardinal Orlando Quevedo, the archbishop of Cotabato, on Monday expressed outrage at the attack and called on Church followers “to pray for the victims and for their families.” Quevedo urged the military, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Moro National Liberation Front, both of which have signed peace agreements with the government, to flush out the perpetrators and bring them to justice. The United Kingdom and Australia on Monday renewed their warnings to their citizens against traveling to western and central Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago because of terrorist activities and clashes between the military and insurgent groups. The British advisory included warning of a possible terrorist attack in Manila."	Terrorism	Terrorism

We regret the error and are correcting the article. Thank you. Communist groups may be behind the attack at a port in Masbate City, the Philippine National Police (PNP) said on Monday. PNP Spokesperson Senior Supt. Benigno Durana said the evidence found in the areas affected by explosion were similar to what communist groups used in other attacks. “Based on the post-blast investigation nakuha ng ating PNP crime laboratory office, nakuha nila yung mga orange PVC pipes and scattered parts of the speedboats,” Durana said in a press briefing. However, he did not specify what specific communist groups he was referring to. According to Durana, PVC pipes were the “preferred materials” of communist-terrorist groups used during their attacks. “I think there’s some basis on the initial findings of the regional director na ito ay kagagawan ng communists-terrorist group,” Durana said."

Arroyo backs martial rule extension in Mindanao after Sultan Kudarat blast	" Speaker Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo is backing a proposal from Malacañang to extend martial law in Mindanao following the bombing in Isulan, Sultan Kudarat that killed two people and injured 36 others. “I support martial law in Mindanao,” Arroyo said in an ambush interview after the blessing of the Romana Pangan District Hospital in Floridablanca, Pampanga on Thursday. “I support what the President does because I’ve been president and I believe that he does not need a peanut gallery to tell him what to do,” she added.

Mamasapano clash survivor among fatalities in Abra blast	" A survivor of the bloody Mamasapano incident was one of the two policemen killed in the grenade explosion in La Paz town, Abra province before dawn Thursday. Police Officer 3 Carlos Bocaig, incidentally, was killed on the same day the ill-fated “Oplan Exodus” happened three years ago. Oplan Exodus was a delicate operation of the elite police group Special Action Force (SAF) against Malaysian terrorist and bomb expert Zulkifli Bin Hir, alias “Marwan”, in Mamasapano, Maguindanao in 2015. Another Mamasapano survivor told INQUIRER.net that Bocaig was a gunner in the 13-man assault team that attacked Marwan’s hut in Barangay (village) Pidsandawan. The survivor, who declined to be identified, described Bocaig as a “warrior.” Bocaig was a former member of the SAF’s seaborne unit. “Even after surviving the battle in Mamasapano, he still volunteered to join combat operations,” the police officer said in Filipino. Bocaig and another policeman were killed while securing VIPs at a town fiesta in Abra province. At least 10 others were wounded in the blast, among them Rep. Joseph Bernos and La Paz Mayor Menchie Bernos."	Terrorism	Terrorism
British MPs slam MI5 over Manchester Arena bombing	"LONDON, Nov 22 — MPs investigating Britain’s 2017 terror attacks said today that the MI5 security service missed key opportunities to stop the Manchester Arena bomber. Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee, a cross-party panel of lawmakers that scrutinises the work of government in these fields, slammed communications service providers (CSPs) for giving terrorists a “safe haven”. The ISC also said their recommendations on previous failings had gone ignored. Britain suffered five terrorist attacks in 2017: at Westminster, London Bridge, Finsbury Park and Parsons Green in London; and at the Manchester Arena, where 22 were killed in a suicide bombing. Thirty-six people were killed in total in the attacks. The Manchester Arena attack, as concert-goers were leaving an Ariana Grande show, was perpetrated by 22-year-old Salman Abedi, a Mancunian of Libyan descent. The ISC’s report said the MI5 domestic security agency missed chances to stop Abedi, moving too slowly after his case had been flagged for review and failing to consider him for referral to the anti-radicalisation scheme. Abedi also visited an extremist contact in prison on more than one occasion but no follow-up action was taken by either MI5 or the police. MI5 did not place travel monitoring or restrictions on Abedi, meaning he was allowed to return undetected from Libya to Britain shortly before the bombing. “There were a number of failures in the handling of Salman Abedi’s case and while it is impossible to say whether these would have prevented the devastating attack on May 22, we have concluded that, as a result of the failings, potential opportunities to prevent it were missed,” the ISC said. Responding to the report, UK counter-terrorism police said they would study the report’s findings “carefully”. “We are deeply committed to learning so that we can refine our response to the evolving threat,” he said. The committee found 12 “cross-cutting issues” which played a part in at least two attacks. On explosives, “the system for regulating and reporting purchases of the ingredients used to make explosives was hopelessly out of date in dealing with the threat posed,” it said, adding that it had facilitated the perpetrators’ actions. Meanwhile appeals to CSPs to tighten up their loopholes had fallen on deaf ears. The committee said that four years ago they concluded that CSPs were failing to stop their systems “being used as a safe haven for extremists and terrorists. “Yet we have seen that appeals to these companies’ sense of corporate and social responsibility have not resulted in them making the changes required — and again these loopholes were used by the perpetrators of the 2017 attacks.” The committee concluded that MI5 and counter-terror police wanted to learn from past mistakes and their determination was impressive. However, “we have previously made recommendations in all of these areas, yet the government failed to act on them. The lessons from last year’s tragic events must now result in real action”, the report said. The probe did not fully cover the bomb attack on a London Underground train at Parsons Green station, because the Home Office interior ministry did not provide full evidence in time for the inquiry. “From what we have seen to date, there were fundamental failings in the handling of this case,” the committee found, saying the “litany of errors” by the ministry, the police and the local authority necessitated a separate review.

 Military girds for more BIFF terror attacks	" Security has been stepped up in densely populated areas in anticipation of more terrorist attacks after a bomb went off in Sultan Kudarat, killing three people and wounding 35 others. Military officials said Thursday that the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters, the group they blamed for the attack, has shifted tactics to gain prominence among international terrorist organizations, and have made urban centers their primary targets. Brig. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, commander of the 6th Infantry Division, said they raised the level of security awareness within his jurisdiction to thwart attacks on urban centers. “Urban centers are their target—crowded places because that’s their thrust to gain support from international terrorist organizations,” Sobejana said. He said this shift was a sign of weakness, as the terrorists are unable to confront ground troops in battle due to depleted armaments. “The emplacement of IEDs [improvised explosive devices] is a clear manifestation that they are becoming weak, they have no firepower to fight government forces,” he said. Since January, the BIFF suffered tremendous setbacks in a series of battles with security forces, particularly in Central Mindanao, losing hundreds of fighters to death or capture. Sobejana said in the Isulan, Sultan Kudarat attack, several leads pointed to the BIFF. To protect civilian communities, he said troop visibility would be increased, with more checkpoints being set up. On Thursday, the death toll in the Isulan blast rose to three after a 21-year-old man, Welmark John Lapides, died after remaining in critical condition in a General Santos City hospital, radio dzBB reported. The report cited Philippine National Police Region 12 spokesperson Supt. Aldrin Gonzales. Tuesday’s blast immediately killed a seven-year-old girl and a 52-year-old woman. Senator Panfilo Lacson said the recent attack suggested that neither martial law nor the Bangsamoro Organic Law could guarantee peace in Mindanao. Lacson said security forces, particularly in Mindanao, should avert the vicious cycle of talking peace with one group while alienating others. At the same time, an anti-terrorism bill he has proposed may give the government a much-needed boost in its fight against terrorists, since it enhances the Human Security Act of 2007 with provisions on foreign terrorists and additional predicate crimes. “While an anti-terror law in itself cannot solve the problem of terrorism, an intensified one can, however, give the government and the law enforcement agencies the much-needed tool in dealing with the emerging threats of terrorism,” said Lacson, who headed the Philippine National Police from 1999 to 2001.While he had a hand in drafting the earlier law, he said gaps in it prevented authorities from implementing it properly. He said the occupation of Marawi City by the Maute Group in 2017 “revealed the many loopholes of the current anti-terrorism law.” He noted the Philippines was ranked the 12th most affected by terrorism by the Global Terror Index in 2017. He added that the Moro Islamic Liberation Front came into being and became a dominant armed force in Mindanao after the government came to a peace agreement with the Moro National Liberation Front. The bill penalizes foreign terrorists, including those who travel to a state other than their state of residence for committing or organizing terrorist acts; and those residing abroad who come to the Philippines in transit to commit or take part in terrorist acts to target countries. Lacson’s bill adds three predicate crimes to the 12 in the present law. These are: RA 9208, Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003, RA 9165, Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 and RA 10175, Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012. Covered as well are other analogous acts that tend to cause death or serious bodily injury, or intend to cause risk to the health, safety or security of the public, or intend to seriously interfere with, disrupt or destroy critical infrastructure. Also covered are acts using weapons of mass destruction, proscribed under relevant treaties and conventions where the Philippines is a state party. The bill punishes those recruiting another person to serve in or with an armed force in a foreign state; publishing an ad or propaganda; and other acts with the intention of facilitating or promoting the recruitment of persons to serve in any capacity in or with such armed forces. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said that while it is too early to recommend an extension of martial law, he said that remains an option in dealing with terrorism in Mindanao. Speaker Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on Thursday said she supports the administration’s view on martial law in Mindanao. Arroyo’s statement came after Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea said Wednesday that extending martial law in Mindanao is an option after the Sultan Kudarat bomb attack. “I support what the President does because I have been president and I believe that he does not need a peanut gallery to tell him what to do,” Arroyo said. House Majority Leader and Camarines Sur Rep. Rolando Andaya Jr. said the House is ready to grant the President an extended martial law in Mindanao should the Chief Executive ask for it. “The declaration of martial law is the call of the executive. The President declares or extends, Congress concurs. If the President will ask for it, then it shall be given,” Andaya said. Andaya also urged the Palace to convene the National Security Council and Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council to discuss the progress of the Marawi rehabilitation program and the Bangsamoro Organic Law."

At least 18 reported killed in Baghdad explosion	" BAGHDAD, June 7 — At least 18 people were killed and over 90 wounded in an explosion in Baghdad's Sadr City district yesterday, an Iraqi police source said. Photos from the scene showed a destroyed car and building as well as weeping relatives of victims. An interior ministry spokesman said in a brief statement the blast was the result of the detonation of an ammunitions cache and that security forces had opened an investigation. The ammunition had been stored in a mosque and the explosion happened during its transfer into a car parked nearby, the police source said. Earlier, state television cited a ministry spokesman describing the explosion as “a terrorist aggression on civilians,” which had caused “martyrs and wounded.” Authorities did not offer an explanation of the discrepancies between the two statements, neither of which gave casualty figures. Sadr City is a stronghold of nationalist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, whose political bloc won a May 12 parliamentary election. Parliament ordered a national recount of votes yesterday. In May, two homemade bombs targeted the headquarters of the Iraqi Communist Party, which is part of Sadr's bloc. "	Terrorism	Terrorism
At least 14 killed in Mogadishu car bombing	"At least 14 people were killed and several others wounded on Thursday when a car bomb blew up outside a popular hotel in the Somalia’s capital Mogadishu. The Al-Qaeda aligned Shabaab group said it was responsible for the blast in front of the Weheliye hotel in the city center, claiming it had targeted a gathering of government officials, army and intelligence officers. A government spokesman said 14 people had died but the toll could rise as rescuers search through the debris. “There was a heavy blast here and the number of casualties we have is so far 14 killed and a number of others wounded,” said Abdiazis Ali Ibrahim, a security ministry spokesman. “The toll could be higher,” he added. Witnesses described a big explosion on Makkah al-Mukarama street, one of the city’s busiest running through central Mogadishu, which was packed with people heading home from work at the time. “The blast was so huge, a vehicle containing explosives went off near a teashop in front of Weheliye hotel, leaving more than 10 people dead. I saw people being rushed to hospital and some of them were already dead,” said witness Abdulahi Moalim. “Most of the casualties are… people who were spending time to take tea, there was devastation and buildings were damaged,” said another witness Mohamednur Abdirahman. Mogadishu is regularly hit by bomb attacks carried out by the Shabaab which is fighting to overthrow Somalia’s internationally-backed government. The Weheliye hotel was previously attacked by Shabaab gunmen in 2015. In October last year, Somalia suffered its deadliest-ever terrorist attack in which more than 500 people were killed in a truck bombing in a busy part of the city. In the wake of that attack, Somalia’s government declared a fresh offensive against Shabaab. The United States has also stepped up the tempo of drone and missile strikes, and increased its support for ground attacks by US-trained Somali forces. The Shabaab was pushed out of the capital in 2011 — and subsequently other towns and cities — by soldiers from the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM). But the Islamists still hold sway in large parts of the countryside and launch regular gun and bomb attacks on government, military and civilian targets in Mogadishu and ambushes on military convoys and outposts. East African leaders contributing to the AMISOM force last month called for the United Nations to reconsider plans to withdraw troops by December 2020, saying the timeline was unrealistic and could lead to a reversal of gains."

No sign Leicester ‘explosion’ linked to terror	" LONDON, Feb 26 — British police said this morning there was no indication a reported explosion and building collapse that injured at least six people in Leicester, a central English city, was linked to terrorism. “The cause of the explosion will be the subject of a joint investigation by the police and Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service,” local police said in a statement. “We would ask that the media and public do not speculate about the circumstances surrounding the incident, but at this stage there is no indication this is terrorist related.” The apparent explosion occurred yesterday evening on a stretch of road containing commercial and residential properties close to the city centre. The electricity supply to a number of properties in the area was cut while emergency services deal with the incident, police said. The Fire and Rescue Service said it received calls shortly after 7pm from the public reporting an explosion and a building fire. It immediately dispatched six fire engines, a spokeswoman said. “We were en route when the police called to say a building had collapsed,” she added. Additional specialist search and rescue units were then dispatched, including a search and rescue dog, according to the spokeswoman. “We’ve got no indication of what the cause is at this moment,” the spokeswoman said. Six people were taken by ambulance to Leicester Royal Infirmary hospital following the incident, according to University Hospitals of Leicester, which runs three area medical facilities. “Two of these patients are in a critical condition, while four are walking wounded,” it said on Twitter. Officials had earlier advised people only to attend the accident and emergency department “if absolutely necessary”. The fire service spokeswoman also said representatives from gas and electric provider companies were in attendance at the scene, under routine procedures. Pictures and videos posted on social media showed a property engulfed in flames visible from a distance, with rubble and debris scattered around. Graeme Hudson told AFP he lives close to the scene and felt the blast. “It was very scary,” he said. “I live five minutes away... but my house shook. I went out and saw massive smoke and big flames. “I quickly went out to see what’s happened,” he added. “(I) didn’t stay for long there because (I felt) unsafe for my 11-year-old son.”"	Terrorism	Terrorism
Gunmen attack China’s consulate in Pakistan as violence flares across region	" KARACHI (REUTERS) – Three suicide attackers stormed the Chinese consulate in the Pakistani city of Karachi amid a series of gunshots and an explosion on Friday (Nov 23), but were killed before they could force their way in with a car packed with explosives, police said. The attack, claimed by separatist insurgents from the impoverished southwestern Pakistani province of Baluchistan, killed four people, including two police, but it was far from the most deadly on a particularly violent day across the region. A suicide attacker on a motorbike set off explosives in a crowded festival and market in north-west Pakistan’s Orakzai region, killing at least 25 people at around the same time as the Karachi bloodshed. Over the border in eastern Afghanistan, a suicide blast at a mosque on an army base killed at least 26 people and wounded 50, security officials said. Earlier in the week, a suicide bomber killed 55 people in the capital, Kabul. The blood-letting comes as faint hopes for peace in Afghanistan have been stirred by two meetings between US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and the Taleban in Qatar. US President Donald Trump said on Thursday the United States was “in very strong” peace negotiations in Afghanistan but he did not know whether they would be successful. The attack on China’s consulate in Karachi was claimed by the separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) insurgent group that opposes Chinese projects linked to its Belt and Road initiative in resource-rich Baluchistan. Two policemen and two people waiting in a queue outside the consulate were killed in the attack, along with the three gunmen. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan called it “part of conspiracy” against Pakistani and Chinese economic and strategic cooperation and ordered an inquiry, his office said. Pakistan has long accused its old rival, India, of supporting the nationalist insurgents in Baluchistan, while India accused Pakistan of nurturing Islamist militants throughout the region. India denies helping the Baluchistan insurgents and was quick to condemn the violence. “The perpetrators of this heinous attack should be brought to justice expeditiously,” India’s foreign ministry said in a statement. India has for decades accused Pakistan of supporting Islamists fighting Indian security forces in the Indian part of the Himalayan region of Kashmir, where increasing violence flared again on Friday with Indian forces killing six militants in a clash. India and the United States also accuse Pakistan of supporting the Afghan Taleban. Pakistan denies that. As the Karachi attack unfolded, an explosion and gunshots rang out in its affluent Clifton neighbourhood and a plume of smoke rose over the area. City police chief Amir Shaikh said the three attackers came in a car filled with explosives but failed to get inside the heavily fortified compound. It was not clear if the car had exploded. “They tried to get inside, but the Rangers and police killed one of the terrorists,” Shaikh said. A gun battle broke out with the two other attackers trying to enter the visa section, but they were also killed, he said. A spokesman for the BLA confirmed there were three attackers. “China is exploiting our resources,” spokesman Jiand Baloch told Reuters by telephone. China has funded development of a deep-water port at Gwadar in south Baluchistan, and is also investing in other projects on a China Pakistan Economic Corridor. Baluchistan, which is on the borders of Afghanistan and Iran, has rich mineral and natural gas reserves but is Pakistan’s poorest province. Separatists have for decades campaigned against what they see as the unfair exploitation of resources, in particular natural gas and minerals. The Chinese government’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, said he was “shocked” by the attack and urged Pakistan to prevent any more such incidents. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said China would “continue unswervingly” to work with Pakistan to develop economic projects. The suicide bomb attack in the Afghan border province of Khost came as people gathered for Friday prayers at the mosque on the army base. The Taleban, who are waging a war to oust the Western-backed Afghan government and expel foreign forces, have launched a series of high-profile attacks against Afghan security forces in recent weeks. The blast in Pakistan’s Orakzai region was also at a Friday festive gathering. There was no claim of responsibility for either of those blasts."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Detoyato: If there was no martial law it could have been worse	"Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Public Affairs chief Colonel Noel Detoyato expressed belief that terrorist groups could have perpetrated more bombings if martial law was not declared in Mindanao. Detoyato made the comment following the deadly blast in Isulan, Sultan Kudarat, that left two people, including a seven-year-old boy, dead and 34 others wounded. “Baka kung walang martial law mas grabe pa (If there was no martial law it could have been worse).That is why the past few attempts nila lagi nating napipigilan (they were foiled) because of the so many checkpoints,” Detoyato said. He added that prior to the explosion that rocked Isulan, there were two previous attempts by terrorist to detonate an IED (improvise explosive device) in the area. “Actually in the town proper of Isulan this is already the ‘nth time na may nare-recover tayo na mga IED (that we recovered IED). Previous times we recovered it before it is detonated because of prior intel. So naaavert natin ang (So we avert the) situation,” Detoyato said. “This time there was also prior intel (report) that is why our security forces were in the area and even accosted the one who placed the.. who left the bag that exploded,” he added. Detoyato said that base on intelligence reports they received, the terrorists are going to conduct bombings in the general area of Isulan. “So that is why we are on the alert. That’s also the reason why a KM-450 military truck doing mobile patrol was also hit,” he said. Detoyato said if pattern and motivation will be the basis, the BIFF (Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters) are behind the explosion. He added that historically, Isulan town has been targeted by extremist because of the economic improvement in the area which is mostly populated by non-Muslim believers. “Nilalagyan nila ng anggulo ng religion that is why Isulan tinatarget nila.” he said. Meanwhile, Army 6th Infantry Division Chief Brig. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, said they are not discounting the possibility that the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) or Islaniyah Toraype Group was behind the explosion. He added that following the incident, Isulan town is currently calm and peaceful “Pero hindi mo maiwasan ‘yung mga constituents na nandun pa rin yung pangangamba kaya nag augment ako ng additional forces to build confidence among the populace ng Isulan (But we cannot avoid that our constituents get worried that’s why we augmented or sent additional forces to build confidence among the populace of Isulan),” Sobejana said."

110 arrested over Surabaya bombings	"Investigations into last month's Surabaya suicide bombings have led to the arrest of 110 suspects, as Indonesian police move to unravel the terrorist network behind the attacks. ""All 110 suspects are linked to one another,"" national police chief Tito Karnavian told reporters on Friday at the Bogor presidential palace, after attending the Eid al-Fitri open house by President Joko Widodo. He declined to reveal details regarding the connections between the suspects and the perpetrators of the triple-church bombings and the attack at the Surabaya police headquarters on May 13 and 14, as operations are still ongoing. ""It is also the peak of our security operations, and ensuring security is our religious duty,"" he added. Most of the suspects were nabbed in East Java, including the five men arrested last Wednesday with a plan to attack police stations and banks. Some were picked up in Central Java. Among the evidence seized during the arrests were a firearm with bullets as well as books on jihad and other radical doctrines, said General Tito. The attacks in Surabaya last month claimed 27 lives, including those of 13 perpetrators who are said to have been in sleeper cells with ties to the Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), a local terrorist group loyal to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The coordinated attacks and traces of military-grade explosives found at the blast sites suggest a rising level of tactical capability among Indonesian terrorists. But it was the fact that the militants were willing to use their wives and children as cover for suicide bombings that shocked the nation. The wide terrorist network uncovered by police in East Java has also raised concern over the rise of extremism in the province. The presence of Islamist militants in East Java, however, is not new. Ali Imron, Amrozi and Mukhlas - three brothers belonging to Jemaah Islamiah (JI) and involved in the 2002 Bali bombings - used to live in Lamongan, a sleepy town about 50km from Surabaya, the capital of East Java. More recently, in 2015, two sisters-in-law from Lamongan were deported from Turkey with their children after trying to enter ISIS-controlled territory in Syria. At the time, the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict said Lamongan's extremist community was shaped by the JI, with many of its attacks hatched and planned in the area. Before it was dismantled by counter-terrorism police in Indonesia, the JI, just like the JAD today, had also provided recruiters, fighters and propagandists for ISIS. Indonesian police will remain on high alert during the Eid al-Fitri holidays and in the weeks ahead, with regional polls, including one to elect the governor of East Java, set to take place on June 27. Security is also expected to be tight at the sentencing of JAD leader Aman Abdurrahman at a Jakarta court on Friday. He was charged with inciting other militants to commit various terror attacks in Indonesia, including an attack in Jakarta in 2016 that left four bystanders dead. Prosecutors are seeking the death sentence for the radical Indonesian cleric, who is also believed to have had a hand in the creation of the Surabaya sleeper cells. Aman had previously preached in Surabaya, and his teachings often describe democracy as ""syirik"", or idolatry, and argued that Muslims have a duty to free themselves from the system and attack instruments of the state such as the police."

"We forgive them', says son of Surabaya church bombing victim"	"The son of a Surabaya bombing victim has said that the family had forgiven those responsible, during the funeral for his mother, Lim, who was killed in the blast at Saint Mary Immaculate (SMTB) Catholic Church on Sunday. Kurnianto arrived on Monday at Bhayangkara Police Hospital along with his father and siblings to take his mother’s body home to Tangerang, Banten, reported kompas.com. His voice shaking, “On behalf of my mother, I apologize if she made any mistakes during her life, and please pray for her, she is now in heaven,” he said on Monday as quoted by kompas.com. “And as for the perpetrators, we forgive them and I believe my mother is in the House of the Lord.” Kurnianto said his mother was on a business trip to Surabaya with her friends, Siska and Susana, to take part in a batik exhibition. They were staying in a hotel that was actually closer to Surabaya Cathedral than SMTB church. “But this is perhaps God’s way. She went to the church in Ngagel instead, which people say is one of the oldest churches in Surabaya,” he said. According to the CCTV footage he had seen, Kurnianto said his mother was right next to the bomber’s motorcycle in front of the church when the bomb detonated. “When I saw the CCTV, I don’t know, perhaps it was God’s beautiful plan. When Mama arrived at the gate, she did not enter the church [and] she stayed there about five minutes,” he said. Kurnianto said he trusted the nation’s security apparatus and that they had been diligent. “My message to the public [is]: Please don’t judge any religions, because no religion asks [the believers] to do evil things. We believe the government has done their best for the nation and stated. And finally, God please help Indonesia,” Kurnianto said."	Terrorism	Terrorism
One dead in latest terror raid in East Java	"Members of the nation’s Densus 88 elite counterterrorism squad killed one terrorist suspect in Surabaya, East Java, on Tuesday afternoon, in the latest raid on members of a local terrorist network accused of being responsible for a string of bombings in the province. “The suspect resisted arrest and endangered the officer, so we took stern action,” East Java Police spokesman Frans Barung Mangera said on Tuesday. The officer refused to identify the 39-year-old suspect. He was the fourth suspected terrorist shot dead by police following bombings that killed 28 people, including 13 suicide bombers or their children. Previously on Monday night, the squad arrested four suspected terrorists in Malang regency, Pandaan and Surabaya. The police have not released the names of the newly arrested suspected terrorists but said they were connected to the perpetrators in the church bombings, including the family of Dita Oeprianto, who blew themselves up at three churches in the provincial capital on Sunday. The police have so far arrested 13 suspected terrorists after the bombings. They are believed to be members of the Jamaah Ansharud Daulah, the main supporter of the Islamic State group in Indonesia."

AFP exerting all efforts to ensure Indonesia terror attacks will not happen here	" The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) today said it is exerting all efforts to ensure that the terrorist attacks in Indonesia will not happen here in the country. AFP spokesman Marine Col.

Definitely, it’s something that civilized nations would condemn,” Arevalo said. “On our part, we are doing our own measures, our own efforts to maintain our desire that no terrorist attack or activity will happen here similar to Indonesia,” he added. Suspected militants on a motorcycle detonated explosives outside police headquarters in Indonesia’s second-largest city yesterday, a day after coordinated suicide bombings on three churches in the city killed at least eight people. A report from AP quoting Police spokesman Frans Barung Mangera said six civilians and four police officers were wounded in the explosion at the police complex in Surabaya. The blast came just hours after police said one family, including girls aged 9 and 12, had carried out the church bombings."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Indonesia jail siege ends after 36 hours	" Indonesian police mounted a daring raid on a high-security detention centre yesterday morning, ending a two-night stand-off with more than 150 terrorist inmates. Crack commandos broke through a wall and used stun grenades to neutralise the inmates before taking back the facility in Kelapa Dua, some 36 hours after the siege started. The detention centre, just 25km from the city centre of Jakarta, houses a number of Islamist militants jailed on terror-related charges. The siege, started on Tuesday night by 156 inmates who support the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), resulted in the deaths of five officers from the counter-terrorism police force. Their bodies showed signs of torture before their throats were slit. Four other officers were injured. One of the inmates was also killed during the initial stage of the violence, which was posted on the Telegram messaging application by several perpetrators who had mobile phones. Police deployed reinforcements from the military and had them on standby and also negotiated with the inmates in a bid to secure the release of hostages. Before dawn yesterday, 145 inmates surrendered, Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs Wiranto told reporters. Just before 7.30am, an explosion and gunshots were heard at the facility. Speaking to reporters later in the morning, the deputy police chief, Commissioner General Syafruddin, said the explosion was meant ""to sterilise the site"" before officers stormed in. Police Mobile Brigade (Brimob) commander Rudy Sufahriadi added that the blast ""was to bring down a wall of a room where we figured they placed homemade bombs"". After the raid, the remaining 10 inmates surrendered. ""We dealt with this (stand-off) using a soft and persuasive approach, although our colleagues have fallen victimto their sadistic acts,"" said General Syafruddin. Police said the mayhem was sparked when inmate Wawan Kurniawan, alias Abu Afif, a member of the Jemaah Ansharut Daulah terrorist group, became furious that guards would not allow visiting family members to give him food on Tuesday. The police clarified that it was a misunderstanding, saying that officers required the meals to be inspected first. At around 8pm that night, Wawan incited other inmates to try to break free. A group of five to 10 inmates in a cell managed to break open the cell door. They then stormed into an interrogation room, where they snatched the weapon of a female officer and beat her up. She is among the four injured officers. The group went into a storeroom which holds confiscated items from raids and took assault rifles, pistols, ammunition and home-made bombs. They attacked other officers and held them hostage. Five of the hostages were killed, three were freed hours later on Tuesday, and the last one was freed at around 2am yesterday. The inmates had asked for food in exchange for the release of the last hostage, Kompas.com cited police spokesman Muhammad Iqbal as saying. Terrorism expert Haris Abu Ulya blamed the incident on the complacency of the police who underestimated what the terrorists were capable of doing. The terrorists' enormous hatred of the police and their wrong belief that the police are the accomplices of the infidels drove them to ""commit such anarchic acts and killings"", Mr Haris told Indonesia's largest radio station Elshinta. All the terrorist inmates have been transferred to Nusakambangan, Indonesia's Alcatraz-like island prison."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Austin ‘serial bomber’ strikes again, motive still unknown"	"AUSTIN, March 20 — Hundreds of police officers and FBI agents searched yesterday for a mysterious “serial bomber” after a blast in the Texas state capital Austin — the fourth this month — left two young men seriously injured and the city on edge. Police said Sunday night’s explosion was connected to three previous bombings in Austin and the bomber used a tripwire in the latest attack, showing a “higher level of skill”. “We’re clearly dealing with what we expect to be a serial bomber at this point,” Austin police chief Brian Manley told reporters. But Manley said police have been unable to determine a motive for the bombings that have killed two people in the city of nearly one million people and injured another four. “Is this terrorism? Is it hate-related?” Manley asked. “As we said from the very beginning, we were not willing to classify this as terrorism, as hate, because we just don’t know enough.” In the earlier bombings, two African American men were killed by packages left on their doorsteps, raising the possibility of a racially motivated crime. A 75-year-old Hispanic woman was also injured in a blast. But Manley said the latest bombing seriously wounded two white men aged 22 and 23 as they walked along a sidewalk or on the road in a quiet residential neighborhood of southwest Austin. He said it appeared “random” and was triggered by a tripwire. “What we have seen now is a significant change from what appeared to be three very targeted attacks to what was last night an attack that would have hit a random victim that happened to walk by,” the police chief said. “We’ve definitely seen a change in the method that this suspect or suspects are using.” Manley said the use of a tripwire also means police are dealing with someone who “shows a higher level of sophistication, a higher level of skill” than initially believed. “With this tripwire, this changes things,” agreed FBI special agent Christopher Combs. “It’s more sophisticated, it’s not targeted towards individuals. “We’re very concerned that with tripwires a child could be walking down a sidewalk and hit something.” Manley appealed to the bomber to contact the authorities and to the public to report anything suspicious. “I will reach out to the suspect or suspects and ask that you contact us, ask that you reach out to us, communicate with us so that we can put this to an end,” Manley said. “There are innocent people getting hurt in this community and it needs to come to a stop.” The authorities said they were increasing the reward offered for information leading to an arrest, bringing the total city and state bounty money to US$115,000 (RM450,512). “We need every tip, every piece of information, however inconsequential you may think it is,” Manley said. A 17-year-old African American teenager, Draylen Mason, was killed on March 12 and the Hispanic woman was critically injured the same day. All of the cardboard packages were hand-delivered, not sent through the mail, and the bombs were built with household items available at hardware stores. Three Democratic members of Congress called for the bombings to be classified as “terrorist attacks” and “investigated as such.” “Also, we need to understand if these attacks are ideologically or racially motivated,” Representatives Bennie Thompson, Cedric Richmond and Sheila Jackson Lee said in a statement. “The community impacted is now under virtual house arrest and the entire city is posed to be in a state of fear -– which can easily transition into panic.” A task force of hundreds of members of law enforcement are working the case, including criminal profilers and experts from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF). Austin Mayor Steve Adler said the manhunt was the “highest priority.” “There’s an army of federal agents,” Adler said on ABC’s Good Morning America. “We’re going to find out who is responsible for this and we’re going to stop it,” he said.

Palestinian PM attacked in Gaza: What does it mean?	" RAMALLAH, March 15 — Palestinian prime minister Rami Hamdallah survived an apparent assassination attempt in Hamas-ruled Gaza this week when a roadside bomb blew up near his convoy. The blast came as an October reconciliation agreement aimed at ending a decade-long split between Islamist movement Hamas and Fatah, which dominates Hamdallah’s government, edged towards collapse. Here is what is known about the incident so far and the potential impact it could have: On Tuesday, Hamdallah was beginning a rare visit to the Gaza Strip when an explosion rocked his convoy, leaving him uninjured but lightly wounding six security guards. The roadside bomb, believed to have weighed around 15 kilogrammes (33 pounds), exploded a few hundred metres from the border with Israel, shortly after Hamdallah’s convoy entered the territory. A second bomb failed to explode, officials said. Who was behind it? The short answer is that it’s not clear — there has been no claim of responsibility. Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas immediately said Hamas was responsible, since it is in charge of security in Gaza, but stopped short of accusing the group of directly carrying it out. Hamas in turn blamed Israel, which has assassinated multiple Palestinian leaders over the decades. Other suspects include smaller, more radical Islamist groups that operate in Gaza but are opposed to Hamas. A senior Hamas official narrowly survived an assassination attempt in October, believed to be the work of jihadists. The attack could also have been the work of hardline Hamas factions opposed to negotiations with the Palestinian Authority. Hamas said it had launched an investigation into the attack, detaining a number of suspects. Why was it a rare visit? Gaza, with its two million residents, forms a large part of the Palestinian territories. But since Hamas seized control in 2007, the internationally-recognised government headed by Hamdallah has had only nominal power in the Strip. Hamas controls the police, security and other government services, while Abbas’s administration is based in the West Bank. Its ministers visit only sporadically. In October, Hamas agreed to hand Gaza back to Abbas’s Palestinian Authority in an Egyptian-brokered reconciliation deal which has since faltered. Key sticking points include the fate of Hamas’s vast armed wing, which has fought three wars with Israel since 2008, and the future of tens of thousands of civil servants. Little progress has been made in recent months. Hamdallah’s attempted assassination could prove a fatal blow for any remaining hope of a negotiated handover of power. After the attack, Hamdallah said he still wanted reconciliation. But a senior Palestinian official told AFP that Abbas has suspended all official visits to Gaza for fear of further attacks. That could further complicate aid programmes in the desperately poor enclave. Israel has blockaded Gaza for a decade, its economy has slumped and residents currently receive only a few hours of electricity a day. Western governments for the most part do not communicate with Hamas, so those who want to support Gaza do so through Hamdallah’s government. His visit Tuesday was to open a wastewater treatment facility paid for by international donors. Does it increase the risk of violence? Gaza’s neighbours Egypt and Israel have expressed concern about the situation in Gaza in recent months, as fears grow that the deteriorating situation could lead to another round of conflict. Neither has opened its border, however. This week the US government held a meeting in Washington to discuss the future of Gaza — without any Palestinian representatives. It did not invite Hamas, which it considers a terrorist organisation, while Abbas and his officials are boycotting Trump’s administration over his controversial recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. Global powers are meeting in Rome Thursday to try to raise money for the UN’s agency for Palestinians refugees, which faces a desperate shortage after the US froze tens of millions of dollars in funds. US President Donald Trump is expected to launch a proposal for Israeli-Palestinian peace in the coming weeks. The contents have been kept secret but Hamas has already rejected it, accusing his administration of pro-Israel bias. Any peace plan would likely be stillborn if it does not find a solution to the issues of Gaza and Hamas. "	Terrorism	Terrorism
Financier prepared Rp 200 million for Thamrin suicide bomber	" man acting as a financier prepared Rp 200 million (US$14,531) along with firearms for a suicide bomber involved in the terrorist attack on Jl. MH Thamrin in Central Jakarta on Jan. 14, 2016, a witness told the South Jakarta District Court on Tuesday. Saiful Munthohir was a witness in the trial of Aman Abdurrahman, the alleged mastermind of the gun and bomb attack that killed eight people, including five terrorists. Some 20 others, police officers and civilians, were injured. Saiful said suicide bomber Muhammad Ali was given Rp 200 million from someone named Rohis. “For amaliyah [a religious practice] a total of Rp 200 million was needed,” said Saiful as quoted by kompas.com. Along with the Rp 200 million, Rohis also provided several firearms to be used by the attackers. Two of the firearms were shown in court and confirmed by Saiful as the weapons provided. According to Saiful, only Rp 75 million of the money was used in the attack and he did not know where the rest of the money went. Muhammad Ali and four of his fellow bombers were killed in the attack, namely Sugito, Dian Juni, Sunakim alias Afif, and Ahmad Muhazan. Sugito and Dian Juni died on Jl. Thamrin in a bomb blast at a traffic police post located in the middle of the road. Afif and Muhammad Ali were shot by the police in the parking lot of Starbucks café, while Ahmad Muhazan blew himself up inside Starbucks. "	Terrorism	Terrorism
Five officers testify in court over Kampung Melayu suicide bombings	"Five police officers have testified in the South Jakarta District Court on Friday on the 2017 Kampung Melayu twin suicide bombings in East Jakarta, allegedly masterminded by terrorist convict Aman Abdurrahman. Imprisoned radical cleric Aman, who is also a supporter of the Islamic State (IS), is  also facing another trial on the 2016 suicide bombing on Jl. MH Thamrin in Central Jakarta. The South Jakarta court’s presiding judge, Akhmad Jaini, asked the five officers, M. Ersyad Alfart, M. Novriansyah, Purwoko, M. Rizki and Kandinan Malin, about the state of the Kampung Melayu bus terminal moments before the blast occurred on May 24, 2017. Three of their colleagues, who were escorting a traditional parade to welcome the Islamic fasting month of Ramadhan, were killed in the blast. Ersyad explained that he and several police officers were waiting for the parade, which had been scheduled to pass the terminal in the evening. Nothing peculiar had happened at that time, but at around 8:50 p.m., the police officers heard two explosions from a nearby Transjakarta bus stop. “After the explosions, I saw the bodies of my friends, Taufan, Gilang and Ridho, lying on the street,” Ersyad recalled, adding that shortly after, another explosion occurred. Witness Purwoko said the three victims were at a parking area near the bus stop, when the blast took place. “Around 25 minutes before the incident happened, I talked with Taufan, while I was repositioning my motorcycle,” Purwoko said as reported by kompas.com. The cleric has been serving his sentence in Nusakambangan maximum security prison in Central Java since 2010 for raising funds for a militant training camp in Aceh province. "	Terrorism	Terrorism
Burkina Faso hit by multiple terror attacks	"OUAGADOUGOU - Armed assailants attacked several targets in Burkina Faso's capital yesterday, including the army headquarters and the French embassy, in a coordinated assault that France's ambassador to the West African region called a terrorist attack. It was the third major attack in Ouagadougou in just over two years. There was no immediate claim of responsibility but previous attacks were conducted by allies of Al-Qaeda in reprisal for Burkina Faso's participation in a regional fight against Islamist militants. A Burkina Faso government statement said four gunmen were ""neutralised"" at the French embassy, adding that operations were continuing and there was no immediate information on civilian casualties. The defence minister said three assailants were killed at the army headquarters. Witnesses said masked gunmen attacked the downtown army headquarters at about 10am. ""I saw people with sacks on their backs attack the guard. Then I heard the explosion. I saw soldiers flee the army headquarters building running,"" witness Kader Sanou told Reuters. The explosion rocked the compound, setting the building on fire and sending up a thick column of black smoke. Panicked residents fled the city centre on foot or motorbikes as dozens of Burkina Faso special forces and armoured vehicles took up positions in the area. ""Burkinabe security forces are mobilised against the attackers with the support of security forces at our embassy,"" said French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian in a statement. The French targets attacked, including the cultural centre, are symbolic given that French President Emmanuel Macron chose to outline his Africa strategy, including the fight against militants, in November in Ouagadougou. France's ambassador to Burkina Faso Xavier Lapeyre de Cabanes confirmed to Reuters that the embassy compound, around 2km from the army headquarters, also came under attack but gave no further details. France's embassy and cultural institute in Ouagadougou are no longer in danger, an aide to Mr le Drian said. Police took up position near the offices of the prime minister where gunfire was also reported. Mr Macron was being kept up to date with events in Ouagadougou, the Elysee Palace said in a statement. A Reuters reporter said gunfire had largely ceased by noon. Islamist militants have stepped up attacks in major cities in West Africa in the last few years, including deadly assaults in Mali, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast and Niger. Suspected militants killed at least 18 people last August during a raid on a restaurant in Ouagadougou, and militants have targeted Burkinabe security forces along its remote northern border region with Mali."

Gunmen attack French embassy and army headquarters in Burkina Faso	" Gunmen attacked the army’s headquarters in the capital of Burkina Faso on Friday as well as the downtown area and France’s embassy, and the French ambassador said an explosion in the city was a terrorist attack. It was not clear who was behind the violence but Burkina Faso and other West African countries have been targeted by jihadist groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State in the past few years. A local news station showed pictures of black smoke coming from a building in central Ouagadougou and a Reuters correspondent found that most people had fled the streets. “Attack under way at the French Embassy and French Institute. Stay hidden where you are,” the embassy said in a statement posted on its Facebook site. A French official in Paris confirmed that an assault against the embassy was under way, as well as against the Burkina Faso army headquarters. An explosion rocked the army headquarters and then gunfire rang out in the vicinity. A witness said masked gunmen with backpacks had attacked the army headquarters shortly before the explosion. Islamist militants have gained a stronger foothold in Africa’s vast Sahel region in the last few years, launching attacks in Mali, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast and Niger. Suspected jihadists killed at least 18 people last August during a raid on a restaurant in Ouagadougou, and militants have targeted Burkinabe security forces along its remote northern border region with Mali. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) claimed responsibility for an attack on a restaurant and hotel in Ouagadougou in January 2016 in which 30 people were killed. Five countries launched a new task force last year to tackle Islamist militants in the region, to which international donors have committed half a billion dollars. Jean-Marc Châtaigner, France’s ambassador to West Africa’s Sahel region, tweeted:“Terrorist attack this morning in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso: solidarity with colleagues and Burkinabe friends.” He urged people to avoid the city center. After the first big blast, the sound of a series of smaller explosions and exchanges of gunfire came from the direction of the headquarters. It ceased by around noon."	Terrorism	Terrorism
 Jokowi allows Abu Bakar Baasyir to receive treatment at hospital	" President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo has granted convicted terrorist Abu Bakar Baasyir permission to be temporarily relocated to a hospital for medical treatment over his declining health. The ailing radical cleric, who is currently serving his sentence at Gunung Sindur prison in Bogor, West Java, is reported to have been admitted to Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital in Jakarta because of swelling in his legs, possibly due to clogged blood vessels. “This is about humanity, which I think also applies to all. If there are [prisoners] who suffer from an illness, it’s our job to admit [them] to a hospital to get treatment,” Jokowi told journalists on Thursday. Baasyir, the spiritual leader of radical group Jamaah Ansharut Tauhid, has been in prison for nearly seven years after the Jakarta District Court sentenced him to 15 years' imprisonment in 2011. He was found guilty of funding a military training camp for a terrorist group in Aceh. The 79-year-old cleric was initially locked up in a high-security prison in Nusakambangan in Cilacap, Central Java. Due to his declining health, authorities relocated him to Gunung Sindur prison in 2016. Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) chairman Maaruf Amin previously called on the President to grant clemency or consider a sentence reduction because of concerns over Baasyir's health. However, when asked about whether the President would grant a sentence reduction, Jokowi said, “I have yet to receive any [sentence reduction] letter.” "	Terrorism	Terrorism
MUI chief calls on Jokowi to grant clemency to Abu Bakar Baasyir	"The chairman of Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI), Maruf Amin, has called on President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo to grant clemency or a sentence reduction to radical cleric and terrorist convict Abu Bakar Baasyir due to his failing health. “If possible, the President can grant him a clemency. But it’s up to him,” Maruf told reporters on Wednesday, as reported by tempo.co. Baasyir has been in prison for nearly seven years after being sentenced to 15 years by the South Jakarta District Court in 2011. The court found him guilty of funding a military training camp for a terrorist group in Aceh. The 79-year-old spiritual leader of Jamaah Ansharut Tauhid was initially locked up in a high security prison in Nusakambangan in Cilacap, Central Java. However, due to his declining health, authorities relocated him to Gunung Sindur prison in Bogor, West Java, in 2016. Maruf also asked Jokowi to allow Baasyir to be admitted to hospital. “I have expressed that to the President and his response was good,” he said without giving further details. Meanwhile, presidential spokesman Johan Budi Saptopribowo refused to comment on the proposal, saying that he needed to confirm with the President first. The Law and Human Rights Ministry granted Baasyir a third three-month sentence cut on Independence Day on August 17 last year. The ailing radical cleric was admitted to Harapan Kita Hospital last year after developing swollen feet due to clogged blood vessels."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Nigerian troops foil Boko Haram attack on base: Army	"KANO, Nigeria (AFP) – Nigerian troops foiled an attempt by Boko Haram fighters to overrun a military base in the restive northeast leaving six soldiers wounded, the army said on Saturday. Troops “successfully repelled a Boko Haram terrorist attack” on a base in the town of Arge in Borno state on Friday, army spokesman Texas Chukwu said in a statement. “Several members of the Boko Haram terrorists were neutralised while others fled with gunshot wounds during the encounter,” he said. “Unfortunately, six soldiers sustained various degrees of injuries and are currently receiving medical attention at the military facility.” Chukwu said three Boko Haram trucks were destroyed and one other vehicle recovered in the latest attack in the area. On August 29, Islamic State (IS)-affiliated Boko Haram extremists claimed to have killed “several” Nigerian soldiers in mortar strikes on the Arge military base. The claim could not be independently verified. Boko Haram’s IS extremist group-backed faction – known as the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) – operates in the Lake Chad region and has in recent months intensified attacks on military bases in Borno and nearby Yobe state. The attacks are seen as a sign of a hardline takeover in ISWAP by more radical lieutenants who executed the group’s de facto leader because of his opposition to indiscriminate killings and willingness to hold peace talks with the government. Scores of soldiers have been killed, injured or missing in attacks but the military have repeatedly denied or played down losses to the extremists."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Duterte is ISIS target in India says report; Palace remains unfazed	"President Rodrigo Duterte remained unfazed with the latest report that he was a target of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) while he is in an official trip in India. “[Duterte] will not cower to threats from ISIS nor any other terrorist groups,” Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said in a statement reacting to story by “The Print” of India. The Print published a report saying Duterte “is on the radar of the Islamic State… is giving security agencies sleepless nights” as he attends a regional summit with Indian and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) leaders. Duterte, along with 10 other Asean leaders is also set to attend the Republic Day in New Delhi on Friday. The Print, quoting a security agency source, said the ISIS terrorists “has mobilized its people and is planning to strike.” But Roque said Duterte was “unmoved by this latest threat and will be unrelenting in his fight against violent extremism.” “All precautions though are being taken by the PSG [Presidential Security Group] and Indian authorities,” he said. “Security arrangements by both PSG and Indian police are in place. We will all be there for and with him,” he added. Duterte, Roque said, “has pledged to serve the Filipino people and has left the issue of his mortality to the Creator.”"	Terrorism	Terrorism
Afghan president names team for Taliban peace talks	"Afghanistan’s President Ashraf Ghani on Wednesday announced a 12-person team for prospective peace talks with the Taliban, as his government pledged unwavering commitment to resolve the conflict despite persistent bloodshed. The Afghan government, Western diplomats and United Nations officials have in recent weeks raised hopes of finally reaching a deal to end the Taliban’s 17-year insurgency. Such optimism has been tempered by continuing attacks, including a massive blast outside a British security company’s compound in Kabul late Wednesday — claimed by the Taliban — which killed at least 10 people. The latest violence came just hours after Ghani told an international conference in Geneva that his government had formed a 12-person negotiating team, comprised of both men and women, to talk peace with the Taliban. It will be led Ghani’s chief of staff, Abdul Salam Rahimi, a former humanitarian worker and ex-deputy Afghan finance minister who is considered one of the president’s closest aides. US envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who met with the Taliban in Qatar earlier this month, had been pushing Ghani to announce a negotiating team. The president also laid out what he termed a “roadmap” for the talks and four principles that he said must form the backbone of any agreement. They include respecting Afghanistan’s constitution and the total rejection of interference in domestic affairs by foreign “terrorist” and criminal groups. “We seek a peace agreement in which the Afghan Taliban would be included in a democratic and inclusive society,” Ghani said. ‘Stars lining up’ Addressing reporters at the end of the conference that saw major donors pledge sustained commitment to the Kabul government, Afghanistan’s national security advisor Hamdullah Mohib said Wednesday’s bomb blast would not deter from the peace push. “Events like this bolster our resolve for peace,” he said. “We have put our step forward,” he added. “The ball is now in the court of the Taliban.” Kabul has offered to meet face-to-face with the Taliban without preconditions, but the insurgents have not yet committed to direct negotiations. Asked why he was confident negotiations were possible despite the violence and the Taliban’s lack of public commitment, Mohib claimed the militants were facing renewed pressure to talk, including from foreign backers. “We see the stars lining up for peace at this point.” Civil society activists in Geneva for the conference voiced concern that in pursuing a deal the Kabul government might give ground on women’s rights to the Taliban, a group notorious for its oppressive treatment of women. Ghani’s government has won praise for trying to redress extreme gender gaps in Afghanistan and the president assured diplomats that he would not compromise on women’s rights to strike a deal. Rare opportunity In a message read to the conference from UN chief Antonio Guterres, deputy under-secretary general Rosemary A. DiCarlo said: “We may have a rare opportunity to move to direct peace talks between the Afghan Government and the Taliban.” European Union foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini told the conference the bloc believed “it is time for concrete talks about peace to begin”. The EU was prepared to act as the “guarantor” of the negotiations, she added. Ghani said earlier this month it was “not a question of if, but when” an agreement would be reached with the Taliban. Khalilzad has said he is “cautiously optimistic” for an end to the conflict."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Task force eyed to quell violence, terror acts"	"The Department of Justice is consideringthat will investigate individuals who may be linked to “lawless or terrorist acts” in areas where the government recently sent troops to quell violence, Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said Saturday. The justice chief made the statement a day after Presidentto Bicol, Samar and Negros provinces to suppress “lawless violence.” According to Guevarra, his department is called upon to probe and prosecute those who might be arrested for criminal acts. In a related development, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said more troops might be deployed to areas controlled by communist to suppress “lawless violence” in the runup to the 2019 midterm elections . Lorenzana’s statement followed President Duterte’s order for more soldiers to be stationed in Bicol, Samar and the Negros provinces citing a “number of [recent] sporadic acts of violence” there. Lorenzana said these areas were considered “critical” during elections since the guerrillas stop candidates from campaigning unless they paid the rebels an undisclosed amount of money. Under Memorandum Order 32, signed by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, the executive sent more government forces to Bicol, Samar, and Negros provinces where a “number of sporadic acts of violence” recently occurred. The order “merely reiterates and reinforces” a similar directive Duterte issued in 2016, Guevarra said.Duterte issued his third Memo in September 2016 when he declared a “state of national emergency on account of lawless violence in Mindanao” after a blast in Davao City killed at least 12 people and injured several others. Officials said the military was still assessing the pre-election scenarios in other areas. The government earlier canceled peace negotiations with the communist movement following continued attacks on government troops despite current talks. According to Lorenzana, the suppression of lawless violence might lead to the extension of military rule in Mindanao, Lorenzana said, but added this would not lead to a declaration of a nationwide martial law. Martial law has been in place in Mindanao since May 2017, at the start of firefights between soldiers and terrorists in Marawi City. It was extended despite the end of the siege in October last year, with government citing remaining threats in the area. Its extension is set to lapse by the end of the year."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Prosecutors demand life for Dortmund bus bomber	"FRANKFURT, Nov 19 — German prosecutors asked a court today to sentence a man accused of an April 2017 bomb attack on Borussia Dortmund’s team bus to life in prison. Defendant Sergej Wenergold committed almost 30 attempted murders by attacking the bus with three improvised bombs as it left the team’s hotel, lead prosecutor Carsten Dombert said. He also faces charges of causing an explosion and two counts of causing serious injury, with judges expected to deliver their verdict next week. The Russian-born German citizen has admitted to placing the bombs, but claims he did not aim to kill anyone—each contained up to a kilogramme (2.2 pounds) of a hydrogen peroxide mixture and dozens of metal bolts. Prosecutors say he in fact aimed to kill as many players as possible, hoping to profit financially after buying so-called put options—essentially a bet on the club’s share price falling. Wenergold left letters supposed to hint at an Islamist terrorist background at the scene, as well as  far left or far right extremist groups. But police eventually joined the dots after realising that the trained electrician had stayed in the same hotel as the Dortmund players on the eve of their Champions’ League match against Monaco. Hidden in a hedge, the explosives were badly positioned and in the end succeeded only in breaking Spanish defender Marc Bartra’s wrist and damaging a police officer’s hearing. Several Dortmund players including Bartra gave emotional testimony during the trial about the trauma they suffered during the attack."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Bahrain sentences four to death for killing policeman	"DUBAI, Nov 12 — Bahrain’s top criminal court today sentenced four Shiite Muslims to death for a 2017 bombing that killed a policeman in the Sunni-ruled kingdom, a judicial official and the public prosecutor said. A statement by the prosecutor’s office said the four were found guilty on charges of premeditated murder and possession of unlicensed arms “with terrorist aims” over the June 18, 2017 bombing. A police officer was killed in the blast in Diraz, a flashpoint village outside the capital Manama. A judicial source involved in the case, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said all four of those sentenced were Shiite Muslims. Only one of them is in custody, according to the London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, which said the three others were tried in absentia. Bahrain, a tiny Gulf state located between regional rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran, has been hit by waves of unrest since 2011, when security forces crushed protests led by majority Shiites demanding an elected prime minister. Authorities have since jailed hundreds of dissidents and stripped many of citizenship, banning all opposition groups under court orders. Diraz in particular has been rocked by protests, police raids, riots and sporadic bombings. The village is home to Bahrain’s top Shiite cleric, Sheikh Isa Qassim, who was stripped of citizenship in 2016 and is under house arrest. Bahraini authorities accuse Shiite Iran of provoking unrest in the kingdom, which Tehran denies. Rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have criticised many of the trials as politically motivated and said they fail to meet basic standards of due process. Monday’s verdict comes ahead of controversial parliamentary elections that Bahrain’s King Hamad has called for November 24 in the key US ally, which is home to the US Fifth Fleet and a permanent British military base. Dissolved opposition parties, including the Shiite Al-Wefaq and secular Al-Waad, do not have the right to put forward their own candidates in the vote. "	Terrorism	Terrorism
US jury convicts New York subway bomber	"A US jury convicted a Brooklyn immigrant from Bangladesh of terrorism on Tuesday for detonating a bomb in a crowded New York subway passage near Times Square in the name of the Islamic State group. Akayed Ullah, 28, who migrated to the United States in 2011, was found guilty by a unanimous jury as Americans went to the polls in the midterm elections. His trial in Manhattan lasted a week. The December 11, 2017 blast wounded Ullah and three other people in a tunnel below the Port Authority bus terminal, not far from iconic Times Square. The bomb, which he strapped to his body with zip wires, failed to detonate as planned, and Ullah was left with burns to his torso and hands. His victims suffered minor complaints such as ringing in their ears and headaches. But the explosion sowed panic and disrupted the morning commute during the busy Christmas tourism season, six weeks after another a truck driver, also reportedly inspired by the IS group, killed eight people on a bike path. Ullah, a driver, was convicted on all six counts and faces a maximum sentence of life behind bars when he is sentenced on April 5, 2019. His convictions include supporting a foreign terrorist organization, using a weapon of mass destruction and bombing a public place. He was caught on CCTV walking through the subway terminal and detonating the bomb strapped to his body. After his arrest, he allegedly told authorities: ""I did it for the Islamic State."" ""Today, Ullah stands convicted, he faces a potential life sentence, and his purpose failed. New York City remains a shining symbol of freedom and hope,"" said Geoffrey Berman, the top US federal prosecutor in Manhattan. Ullah built the bomb in his apartment, packing the device with metal screws and Christmas tree lights, having planned the attack for several weeks. On the morning of the bombing, Ullah posted a statement on Facebook referring to the US president saying: ""Trump you failed to protect your nation."" A chilling handwritten note saying ""O America die in your rage"" was found, along with metal pipes, wires and screws in his home, prosecutors said. Ullah began to radicalize in 2014, three years after moving to the United States, by watching IS propaganda online before starting to research how to make bombs a year ago, officials said. Prosecutors say he opposed US government policies in the Middle East and wanted to terrorize as many people as possible, deliberately choosing a week day when the area would be most crowded."

"Netherlands foils 'major terrorist attack', 7 arrested"	"WRITER: AFP THE HAGUE - Dutch police arrested seven men Thursday suspected of plotting to carry out a ""major terrorist attack"" at a public event using explosive belts and an AK-47 assault rifle, the public prosecutor's office said. Police officers conduct an investigation at the residence of an alleged jihadist in Rotterdam on September 27, 2018 ""Police arrested seven men on Thursday... suspected of being at a very advanced stage of preparation for a major terrorist attack in the Netherlands,"" it said in a statement, adding one of the suspects had wanted to kill ""many victims"". Prosecutors and investigators were ""convinced that a terrorist attack was prevented"" as a result of the arrests in the cities of Arnhem and Weert which followed a months-long police operation. Officers had placed a group of people under surveillance, a central figure being a 34-year-old man of Iraqi origin convicted in 2017 of attempting to reach territory controlled by the jihadist Islamic State group, the statement added. Those arrested by elite special anti-terrorist police teams with helicopter support ranged in age from 21 to 34. The suspects came from Arnhem, the port city of Rotterdam and villages close to those two cities. Two others in the group also had convictions related to attempts to travel to Iraq or Syria. ""One of the men from Arnhem wanted to commit an attack with a group at a major event in the Netherlands and kill many victims, according to the Dutch Intelligence Service (AIVD),"" the prosecutor's office said. Police had yet to identify the target of the planned attack which the prosecutor's office said was to have included a separate car bombing. The suspects, who investigators said said were in possession of small arms when they were detained, are expected to appear in court in Rotterdam on Friday. ""They were seeking AK-47 assault rifles, grenades, explosive belts and raw materials with which to make other bombs,"" investigators said. - Dutch on alert - The arrests came three months after two men were arrested in Rotterdam on suspicion of preparing attacks in France and in the Netherlands. Prosecutors said earlier this month they were ""close"" to launching their attack. There has been no mention of what the target in France might have been. In the Netherlands the pair are said to have staked out and ""identified several possible targets"" in Rotterdam, including ""a police station and the Erasmus Bridge"", the country's second largest. On August 31, an Afghan aged 19 and with a German residence permit stabbed and injured two American tourists at Amsterdam's busy Central Station before being shot. The prosecutor's office said he had chosen the Netherlands for the attack believing Islam to be ""frequently insulted"" there. The Amsterdam incident came following a Taliban call for attacks on Dutch troops after far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders organised a Prophet Muhammed cartoon competition. Many Muslims consider images of the prophet to be blasphemous. The likelihood of a terror attack in the Netherlands ""remained substantial"", the Dutch anti-terror agency NCTV said last week, with terror threat levels remaining at level four out of five."

Military to continue Operation vs Reds	"DESPITE the Norwegian government’s earlier commitment to support peace negotiations with the communist rebels, the military will continue to launch anti-insurgency campaign to wipe them out for threatening to kill a soldier a day, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said. “While we all want peace, we cannot see the sincerity of the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army of the Philippines [CCP-NPA] to have a genuine peace talks,’ Roque said over a radio interview. “”, (For now, there’s no peace talks as fighting continues. They (rebels) are talking with gun fires and targeting Filipinos”, Roque said. ‘So why would the government insist on the peace dialogue when the rebels don’t want peace,” he said, adding, “so war against the CPP-NPA will continue.” Roque said CPP founder Jose Maria “Joma” Sison has threatened the Duterte administration of killing a soldier every day. But President Rodrigo Duterte answered back at the communist leader’s threat and said that he would order the military to kill five NPA rebels for every soldier killed by the rebels. “The message is, ‘You don’t threaten us, Joma Sison. We are the state. If we haven’t eradicated you, it’s because we opted not to eradicate you as Filipinos. But if you want war, we’re ready to go to war,’” Roque said.In fact, Duterte has raised the P20,000 bounty to P25,000 for each communist rebel killed by government forces to save on anti-insurgency costs. “You kill an NPA today and I’ll pay you P25,000,” Duterte said in a speech at an air base in Cebu City, referring to NPA guerrillas. In November last year, Duterte issued a proclamation formally ending peace negotiations with communist rebels. The President signed proclamation 360 declaring the termination of peace negotiations with the NDF-CPP-NPA. The President considered the communist group as terrorist. However, the government official clarified that the military is only going after the NPA, the armed unit of the CPP which has waged a 50-year-old insurgency. The government will use all available assets of the Armed Forces to wipe out the communist rebels, Roque said."	Terrorism	Terrorism
 Several dead in operation to arrest pilot	"CARACAS?Several people, including two police officers, were killed in an operation to capture a helicopter pilot who bombed Venezuela’s Supreme Court during anti-government protests last year, the interior ministry said Monday. A ministry statement said members of a “terrorist cell” were killed in a fierce gun battle, and five were captured, but did not say whether the pilot, Oscar Perez, was among the dead or detained. Six police were wounded, President Nicolas Maduro told lawmakers. The cell had planned to set off a car bomb outside the embassy of “a beloved and prestigious country,” Maduro said. Reports said Perez and associates were holed up for hours in a house 25 kilometers northwest of Caracas during the raid. Perez released videos on Instagram in which he said authorities were trying to kill him and his people even though they wanted to surrender.  Press reports said Perez did in fact die in the raid. At the height of street protests against Maduro last June, Perez and unidentified accomplices flew over Caracas in a police helicopter and dropped four grenades on the Supreme Court before opening fire on the interior ministry. There were no casualties. Perez has been on the run since Venezuelan authorities issued an arrest warrant through Interpol after accusing him of a “terrorist attack.” The 36-year-old former elite police officer and actor has regularly taunted the government during his time in hiding, saying he was fighting against Maduro’s “tyranny” and the “narco-dictatorship.”  He urged Venezuelans “not to lose heart. Fight, take to the streets, it is time we are free.” Two weeks after the attack on the Supreme Court, Perez -- at the time Venezuela’s most-wanted man -- turned up at a Caracas ceremony to commemorate those who had died in the wave of anti-government protests. In all, 125 people were killed between April and July as authorities used force to put down protests to unseat Maduro. Eventually, the protests fizzled out and the socialist president prevailed, despite a staggering crisis caused by falling oil prices, spiraling inflation and corruption. “These terrorists, who were heavily armed with high-caliber weapons, opened fire on the officials responsible for their capture,” the interior ministry statement said. It said those who resisted had been killed.The police were “attacked violently” when they were negotiating the surrender of Perez’s group, it said, adding that they had “tried to detonate a vehicle loaded with explosives.” AFP journalists trying to reach the area saw an army tank, special forces and ambulances rush to the scene.  Perez said in a video released on Twitter earlier Monday that he and his companions were surrounded and pinned down by police marksmen at El Junquito on the outskirts of Caracas. “They are firing at us with grenade launchers. We said we are going to surrender but they do not want to let us surrender. They want to kill us,” a bloody-faced Perez said in one of the videos posted online. Perez, a former elite police officer, is seen with other men in one of the videos, some of them armed. He said they were being besieged by snipers. “We will die standing up defending our land, never kneeling before the tyrants,” another of Perez’s messages said. The vice president of the ruling Socialist party, Diosdado Cabello, said on Twitter the Police Special Action Force (FAES) had launched the operation to arrest Perez. He said the security forces had “responded with fire” when two officers were wounded in the operation. Iris Varela, Venezuela’s minister with responsibility for prisons, rejoiced at the news that police had finally cornered Perez “like a rat.” “What a coward now that he has been caught like a rat. Where is the courage he had to attack military units, kill and injure officers and steal weapons?” she wrote on Twitter. In December, Perez claimed responsibility for an attack on a military base in the country’s north, in which weapons were seized. Perez said in a message to his children that his fight against the government was dedicated to them and to the children of Venezuela, suffering the worst of the food and medicine shortages caused by the economic crisis. Perez, blond and blue-eyed, was well known to Venezuelans even before his attack on the Supreme Court?as an actor. He starred in the film “Muerte Suspendida” (Suspended Death), an action movie based on the true story of the kidnapping of a Portuguese businessman in Caracas."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Colombian army: 16 Farc dissidents killed in border operation	"BOGOTA, June 14 ? Sixteen dissident members of Colombian former guerrilla group Farc were killed in a military operation on the border with Venezuela, the army said yesterday. “We will not lower our guard against these criminals,” President Juan Manuel Santos wrote on Twitter. The operation was carried out in the municipality of Fortul, in the South American country's department of Arauca, the army statement said. The statement gave few details of the military action, but Defense Minister Luis Carlos Villegas told reporters that a prominent rebel commander, Alex Rendon, could be among the dead. The army said the group was responsible for attacks on a local hospital, oil infrastructure and security forces in the area. It said the group had combined with local leaders of the National Liberation Army, or ELN by its Spanish acronym, to try to control drug trafficking in the departments of Arauca, Boyaca and Casanare, as well as coordinate “extortion activities, arms trafficking and the articulation of terrorist plans.” The ELN is currently in peace talks with Santos' government. Santos signed a 2016 peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), the country's largest rebel group, which has since transformed into a political party. But around 1,200 dissident combatants refused to lay down their arms and continue to operate in various parts of Colombia. This was the biggest operation yet against the rebel holdouts.

Fall of wife of Malaysian terrorist Marwan weakens Jemaah Islamiah: Philippine police	"CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY (PHILIPPINE DAILY INQUIRER/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - The arrest on Sunday (Feb 25) of the wife of slain Malaysian terrorist Zulkifli Hir, or Marwan, has weakened the South-east Asian terror group Jemaah Islamiah (JI), according to the Northern Mindanao police. Police, however, were still on high alert for retaliatory attacks by JI and other terror groups, according to Superintendent Lemuel Gonda, spokesman for the Northern Mindanao police. Gonda said police were not taking any chances since remnants of JI in the Philippines, who have also pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terror group, appeared to be regrouping after the loss of key leaders and the arrest of Juromee Dongon, wife of Marwan. Marwan was killed in a police operation in 2015 that also resulted in the massacre of 44 elite police officers in Mamasapano town, Maguindanao province. Dongon and four other terror suspects were arrested in separate raids in Tubod and Baroy towns in Lanao del Norte province on Sunday. The arrests, plus the death of Marwan, dealt a severe blow to JI, Gonda said. He described Dongon, who was also formerly married to Abu Sayyaf leader Khadaffy Janjalani, as a ""high-profile"" JI member who played a key role in the terror group's operations even after Marwan's death. Dongon, according to Gonda, gave JI ""all forms of support, from access to financial sources to networking with associates and other terror groups"". JI was still a major concern of police, Gonda said, adding that the terror group was ""evolving"". ""They are getting in touch with other groups,"" Gonda added. Captain Jo-ann Petinglay, spokesman for the Western Mindanao Command based in Zamboanga City, said the military had monitored several trips by Dongon to Marawi City shortly before ISIS followers tried to set up a base there. Dongon, according to Petinglay, was familiar with Marawi because she studied at Mindanao State University. Dongon was also ""verified"" to be the secretary-general and finance officer of ""a local JI group"", Petinglay said."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Egyptian army says 16 militants killed in Sinai operation	"CAIRO (Reuters) - Sixteen militants were killed and four arrested in a major security operation launched by Egypt on Friday, the Egyptian military said on Sunday (Feb 11), the first casualties in a campaign aimed at crushing insurgents behind a string of attacks. The military also said in a statement carried by state television that 66 targets, arms depots and SUVs and motor-bikes used by militants were destroyed in raids focused mainly in Sinai, but also including parts of the Nile Delta and the western desert. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who is seeking re-election in March, ordered the armed forces in November to defeat militants within three months after an attack on a mosque killed more than 300 people, the deadliest such incident in the Arab world's most populous country. Islamist insurgents have been targeting security forces since 2013 when the army, then led by Sisi as army chief, ousted President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood following mass protests against his rule. The operation involves troops from the Egyptian air force, navy and ground forces as well as the police and border guards. ""The air force targeted and destroyed 66 targets used by terrorist elements to hide from air and artillery attacks, and to escape from their bases during raids,"" the statement said. A total of 16 militants were killed, it said. The statement also said forces involved in the operation found a media centre with computers, communication equipment and books and documents related to extremist ideology. Security forces also uncovered and destroyed six farms used to grow banned narcotics, the statement said."	Terrorism	Terrorism
France’s Macron warns Turkey over Syrian operation	"PARIS, Jan 31 — French President Emmanuel Macron warned Turkey that its operation against Kurdish militias in northern Syria should not become an excuse to invade the country and said he wanted Ankara to coordinate its action with its allies. “If it turns out that this operation takes a turn other than to fight a potential terrorist threat to the Turkish border and becomes an invasion operation, (then) this becomes a real problem for us,” Macon said in an interview with Le Figaro newspaper published today."

"Suspected terrorist, Pinay girlfriend arrested in Malate"	" A suspected leader of an international terrorist group and his Filipina companion were arrested in a joint counter-terrorism operation conducted by the Philippine National Police (PNP) and Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) in Manila over the weekend. Assorted firearms, ammunition, components for improvised explosive device (IED), and a black ISIS flag were seized from the two suspects. The PNP identified the suspects as Fehmi Lassqued alias John Rasheed Lassqued, 33,said to be an Egyptian national; and AnabelMonceraSalipada, 32, of Upi, Maguindanao. Both were presented Monday by PNP Chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa and Brigadier General BienvenidoDatuinJr, commander of AFP-Civil Relations Service (CRS), at the PNP headquarters in Camp Crame, Quezon City. According to Dela Rosa, Lassqued had served as a negotiator between the ISIS leadership and local government officials in Syria and Turkey, and a former ISIS commander in the Syrian-Turkish border. He now serves as an active ISIS recruiter of Filipino terrorist fighters, Dela Rosa said. Lassqued had entered the country in mid July 2016 via Iran,using a fake Tunisian passport. He has denied being an Egyptian, saying he is half Tunisian and half Libyan. He has admitted using a fake Tunisian passport. “Ever since, he’s been in and out of Manila,”Dela Rosa told reporters. Dela Rosa said Lassqued and Salipada were arrested at Room 409 of Casa Blanca Apartment on M. Adriatico St., Malate, Manila, late Friday by virtue of a search warrant issued by a local court. Assorted firearms, ammunition, components for improvised explosive device (IED), and a black ISIS flag were seized from the two suspects. Dela Rosa told reporters that they had “received information from our foreign counterparts about Lassqued.” “Then we did a case buildup and it turned out the information was positive. We applied the search warrant.” The possibility that Lassqued has already made contact with interested Filipino terrorists was considered by Dela Rosa. “If he can recruit via the Internet, how much more if he is already here. He has physical contact with possible recruits,” he added. The two suspects are now detained at the PNP Camp Crame in Quezon City It was learned that Lassqued made five foreign outings since he arrived in the country – three trips to and from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and two trips to and from Istanbul, Turkey – from July 26, 2016 to November 9, 2017. Aside from foreign trips, authorities are now searching for the places the suspect visited in the Philippines. He said Lassqued might have recruited via social media networks and personal visits in conflict-afflicted areas in the country. Meanwhile, National Capital Region Police Office Director Oscar Albayalde said that Lassqued might have been offering financial assistance to prospected recruits to entice them to join the ISIS. “One factor is finance. Apparently, he can sneak in money into the country. We have yet to determine how much money is involved,” he said. Albayalde also said there were indications that Lassqued was planning a terror attack because of the drawings of maps of unidentifiable places confiscated from him. “There are indications (of possible terror plot) because we found some drawings, maps. We will conduct our final tactical interrogation and only then will we know other details,” Albayalde said. According to authorities, Salipada denied any involvement in the alleged terrorist activities of Lassqued. Albayalde said Salipada might have been used as a cover for the terrorist acts of Lassqued. “For cover, not necessarily she knew what she was doing but usually, if you want to remain in a specific place for a long time, you will look for a partner, or wife to make your stay legal,” he explained. Dela Rosa assured that the public is still safe and security remains on high alert. “We are continuously conducting close coordination with airport authorities. It is a good thing that this terrorist was arrested, that means we’re still safe,”Dela Rosa said. Meanwhile, Datuin said that the excellent collaboration and cooperation between the military and the PNP should be credited for the arrest of the suspected terrorist and his Filipina companion. “Napakaganda nitong success ng joint operations of the AFP and PNP (The successful joint operations of the AFP and PNP is beautiful). Makikitanatinang (We can see the) collaboration and cooperation with the two sectors, two important forces in the security sector and I just hope natuloytuloynaito (that this will continue),”Datuin said. AFP Spokesman Marine Col. Edgard Arevalo said the inspiring result of the joint AFP-PNP operation “is also a proof of what a robust intelligence sharing and collaboration can do to keep our nation and its people safe.” The Department of Justice (DOJ) is set to conduct a preliminary investigation over the criminal raps filed against Lassqued and Moncera. Senior Assistant State Prosecutor Peter Ong said the foreigner and his Filipina girlfriend yesterday met their lawyer from the Public Attorney’s Office (PAO) and decided to execute a waiver to their arbitrary detention and proceed with the preliminary investigation. “They decided to execute a waiver and to submit their counter-affidavit next week Wednesday, February 28,” Ong said. Lassqued and Monsera were subjected to inquest proceedings before Ong on Sunday in Fort Bonifacio in Taguig City over the criminal raps filed by the National Capital Region Police Office-Regional Intelligence Division (NCRPO-RPIOU) for illegal possession of firearms and ammunition under Republic Act (RA) 10591, the Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunition Regulation Act of 2013); and illegal possession of explosives under RA 9516, the Act amending Presidential Decree 1866. Ong noted that during Sunday’s proceedings the two had no lawyer and he suggested that they go to the DOJ Monday to meet with PAO lawyers who can represent them. Lassqued claimed that the weapon and IEDs have been planted by police. “They want to make a case and make themselves as heroes. They catch big terrorist, international like that,” he told reporters as he denied being a member of ISIS and has been involved in planning terrorist attacks. Lassqued said he participated in the 2011 revolution which unseated slain Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. “I joined the revolution against Gaddafi. The NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) helped us to remove Gaddafi,” he said.He said that after that, he was forced to leave the country using a fake passport."	Terrorism	Terrorism

 Police start security operation a month ahead of British royal wedding	"LONDON (REUTERS) - Police in Windsor, where Prince Harry marries American actress Meghan Markle next month, said on Thursday (April 19) they had begun one of the biggest security operations in their history to ensure the event passes off safely. Harry, 33, and Markle, 36, will tie the knot on May 19 at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, the home of the prince's grandmother which dominates the town about 30km west of London. More than 100,000 visitors are expected to descend on Windsor to celebrate the wedding and police have said that barriers to stop vehicle attacks, armed patrols, and airport-style security would be deployed to prevent any incident. Specialist explosive detection dogs from Thames Valley Police searched the town on Thursday, examining mail boxes, phone booths and drains for signs of potential explosive devices. ""This is a large operation for any police force and one of the biggest I have worked on,"" said police search coordinator Andy Turner. ""We of course want it to all go smoothly."" Britain is on its second-highest threat level - severe - meaning an attack is considered highly likely. Last year, there were five incidents classified as terrorism, in which 36 people were killed. Police said shops and buildings would be searched in the days leading up to the wedding. British Transport Police also said they would have both covert and highly visible officers across London and southeast England on the day, with firearms units at key stations. ""We've worked closely with our partners at other police forces, local authorities and train companies to ensure that we can respond quickly and decisively to any incident - whatever it may be,"" said Chief Superintendent John Conaghan. Bob Broadhurst, the officer who was in charge of policing the 2011 wedding of Harry's elder brother William to wife Kate, has said there several issues police would have to be prepared for. ""It is impossible to search tens of thousands of people who want to come and line the streets, any one of which could be a potential terrorist; someone who's besotted with the royal family - and there are a number of those; or just an attention-seeker,"" he told Reuters earlier this month. He said officers had dealt with 18 protests on the day of the 2011 wedding, which passed off without incident, but there were complaints from campaigners that police had been heavy-handed. The anti-monarchist Republic group said it had written to the local police chief asking for assurances peaceful protests would not be stopped this time. ""The monarchy is a contested institution and, while this is a private wedding, all major royal events such as this are used as PR for the monarchy,"" wrote Graham Smith, Republic's chief executive."

Turkey detains students after Erdogan's 'terrorist' rebuke	"ISTANBUL (AFP) - Turkish police on Sunday (March 25) were holding seven students from a prestigious Istanbul university after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused them of behaving like ""terrorists"" for staging an action opposing his military campaign in Syria. Police stormed a students' dormitory and a house at Bogazici University around dawn Sunday (March 25) and detained three students - two men and one woman, lawyer Inayet Aksu told AFP. With the latest detentions, the number of students being held by the police rose to seven, he added. Erdogan on Saturday had slammed anti-war students at Bogazici University as ""terrorists"" as tensions rose on the campus over divided views of Turkey's cross-border military campaign in Syria. A group of students this week opened a stand handing out sweets or Turkish delight they had dubbed ""Afrin delight"" in memory of the fallen soldiers in the army's almost two-month operation to capture the city from a Syrian Kurdish militia force. In a show of protest, another group of students unfurled anti-war banners. Aksu told AFP the detentions began on Thursday (March 22), based on the video recordings. ""An (anti-war) expression could disturb certain quarters but it cannot be considered a crime under the Turkish penal code,"" he said. In his blistering attack, Erdogan labelled the anti-war students as ""communists"" and ""terrorists"" and the other group as ""believers"". ""While this youth was distributing sweets there, that communist, traitor youths dared to storm their stand,"" Erdogan said to his Justice and Development Party (AKP) at a provincial congress in Samsun on the Black Sea. Erdogan said an investigation was being launched and vowed to identify the anti-war students. Ankara in January launched an offensive in the enclave of Afrin in Syria to root out the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) militia, which Turkey brands a terrorist group. On March 18, Turkish forces and their rebel allies took full control of Afrin, with the YPG largely withdrawing without a fight. In Turkey, police have detained over 500 people for social media posts and protests speaking out against the military offensive in Syria. The crackdown - which has also targeted the national medical association - has raised alarm bells over the state of freedom of expression under Erdogan who has blasted opponents of the Syria campaign as ""traitors."" Kati Piri, the European Parliament's Turkey rapporteur, took on Twitter to protest Erdogan's latest salvo targeting anti-war students. ""Anti-war protesters labelled 'terrorists' by President Erdogan. Critical thinking dangerous endeavour in 'new Turkey'"", she wrote."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Communications stop order necessary for security operations against terrorist incidents	"We refer to the Forum letters published last Friday on the Public Order and Safety (Special Powers) Bill (Bystander photos, videos could deter more attacks, by Mr Ivan Teo; Balance communications ban during attacks with need to stay informed, by Mr Sean Lim; and More police powers welcome but allow media to report facts, by Mr Rajasegaran Ramasamy). A Communications Stop Order (CSO) is necessary to ensure that security operations undertaken by police officers are not compromised by unauthorised communications, and to avoid jeopardising the safety of officers and members of the public involved in the operations. If the Commissioner of Police assesses that it is necessary to activate the CSO for these reasons, it will be in force in the specific location where the operation is ongoing, for the duration of the operation. We have seen from overseas terror attacks that such powers are necessary to effectively deal with present-day terror attacks. Leakage of information to the terrorists in, for example, the Mumbai attacks in 2008 and Paris Hyper Cacher supermarket attack in 2015, endangered both the lives of security officers responding to the attacks, and members of the public caught in it. During last year's Las Vegas shooting incident, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department had to urge the public not to livestream or share tactical positions of officers on the scene, to avoid putting emergency responders in danger. The police will communicate the activation of the CSO to the public through various platforms (including print, broadcast and social media), and also on the ground if need be. When the CSO is in force, the making or communicating of videos or pictures of the specified location, and the communicating of text or audio messages about the ongoing security operations in the incident area, are prohibited. However, the public can still submit information to the police via the 999 hotline, or through the iWitness and SGSecure mobile applications. The police will also not take action against those caught up in the incident who made such communications, for example, people trapped in the incident location trying to get messages out."

Malaysian Al Qaeda scientist who tried to produce WMD to be released from jail next year	"KUALA LUMPUR: A Malaysian scientist who once led Al Qaeda’s quest to produce weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in Afghanistan will be released from prison next year, according to Malaysian police, who warn that he remains a security risk. Yazid Sufaat, 54, an Al Qaeda operative who helped set up a laboratory in Kandahar, Afghanistan where he tried to cultivate anthrax, has been jailed three times by Malaysian authorities for terror-related offences in the past 16 years. “He (Yazid) will be released in the middle of next year,” Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay, head of Malaysian police's Special Branch counterterrorism division, told the International Association for Counterterrorism and Security Professionals (IACSP) on Monday (Aug 27). The Special Branch is the intelligence arm of the Royal Malaysian Police and the leading agency in counter-terrorism operations in the country. Yazid, a former army captain, was detained for eight years under the Internal Security Act (ISA) between 2002 and 2010. The ISA was replaced by the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act (SOSMA) in 2012. After Yazid's release, he started recruiting new members for Islamic State in Syria. In 2013, he was re-arrested again under SOSMA and was imprisoned for four years in a Tapah prison in Perak state. Then in 2017, he was re-arrested and detained for two years, after it was found that he had been recruiting fellow inmates for Al Qaeda during his incarceration in Perak. “The fact that he indulged in terrorism-related activities after his release from the ISA and embarked on a recruitment drive among prisoners at the Tapah prison clearly show that he is unrepentant,” Ayob told Channel NewsAsia on Wednesday (Aug 29). But counterterrorism expert Ahmad El-Muhammady, who interviewed Yazid in prison in November 2016, believes he would not take up arms again. “I sense exhaustion, loneliness in him (Yazid) due to the long (prison) sentence. He just wants to return home,” Ahmad, a lecturer from International Islamic University Malaysia, told Channel News Asia. “I don’t deny his radical ideas remain to a certain extent. Behaviour-wise, I believe he would abandon terrorism.” But asked whether terror groups will look for Yazid after his release given his skills as a bio-chemistry scientist, he said “they might”. “The question is, does he want to sacrifice his freedom after such a long absence from his beloved family? From what I observe he will not,” said Ahmad. Yazid is married with three daughters. While in prison, Yazid commanded the respect of his fellow inmates as a senior Al Qaeda operative, making it easy for him to recruit members for the terror group in the Tapah prison, Ahmad said. “Inmates respected him due to his stature in Al Qaeda, experience, seniority and knowledge. None of the other detainees matched the breadth of his experience,” said Ahmad. Yazid, a former army captain, is a graduate of biological science and chemistry from California State University, US. According to Professor Zachary Abuza of the National War College in Washington DC, Yazid came close to producing mass biological weapons together with Hambali, Al Qaeda’s Southeast Asia leader. “At the time of 9/11, he (Yazid) and Hambali, Al Qaeda's chief of operations in Southeast Asia, were in Kandahar, where they were hoping to take a virulent strain of anthrax into possession,” said Prof Abuza who specialises in terrorism and insurgencies in Southeast Asia. “They had all the facilities and know-how to mass produce the biological weapon. What they did not have was the Ames stain of anthrax, the most lethal strain that is used in anthrax weapons.” Yazid also bought 21 tonnes of ammonium nitrate to be used in terror attacks in Singapore. “At the time of his arrest, he had already dispatched four tonnes of ammonium nitrate,” said Prof Abuza, adding that the rest of the material was eventually found."

Clashes leave 27 dead as Yemen troops target Al-Qaeda	"Eight soldiers and 19 suspected members of Al-Qaeda were killed in Yemen on Sunday, as the army launched an offensive against key outposts of the extremists, a military official said. General Faraj al-Bahsani, governor of Hadramawt province, told AFP the army had taken control of the Mesini Valley west of Mukalla, a central site for Al-Qaeda in southeast of the country. Mukalla was the most populated Yemeni city under direct Al-Qaeda control from 2015 to 2016, when the army and its regional military allies seized control of the port city. Special forces trained by the United Arab Emirates -- a key member of a Saudi-led alliance fighting alongside Yemen's government forces -- over the weekend launched the offensive, codenamed ""Al-Faisal"", against Al-Qaeda cells in oil-rich Hadramawt province. Two soldiers were killed on Saturday in the offensive, which targets the Mesini and Amed Valleys -- both in the vast province of Hadramawt and home to Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). The two valleys are critical to control over Yemen's southeastern coastline. More than 9,200 people have been killed in the Yemen war since 2015, when the Saudi-led coalition joined the government's fight against Iran-backed Huthi rebels. Radical groups, including AQAP and the Islamic State group, have flourished in the chaos of the war, regularly launching attacks on government and military targets. The United States, the only force known to operate armed drones over Yemen, has ramped up a long-running campaign against AQAP since President Donald Trump took office in 2017."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Turkey designates Syria's Tahrir al-Sham as terrorist group	" ISTANBUL: Turkey has designated the insurgent group Tahrir al-Sham as a terrorist organisation, according to a presidential decision published on Friday, as Damascus prepares for a military assault in northwest Syria where the group holds sway. The notice in the Official Gazette matches a decision by the United Nations in June to add Tahrir al-Sham to the list of people and organisations whose assets are to be frozen because of links to militant groups al Qaeda and Islamic State. It comes before an expected attack by the Syrian army, backed by Russia, on the northwestern Syrian region of Idlib which is home to nearly 3 million people on the border with Turkey. Tahrir al-Sham, which includes the al Qaeda-linked group formerly known as Nusra Front, is the most powerful jihadist alliance in Idlib, the last major rebel-controlled enclave outside Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's control. Russia said on Friday the Syrian government had every right to chase terrorists out of Idlib, adding that talks were underway to set up humanitarian corridors there. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said last week it would be disastrous to seek a military solution in Idlib, even though there were militants there. Ankara, which has a small military presence in Idlib, has warned an assault could unleash a fresh wave of refugees. ""It is important for all of us to neutralise these radical groups,"" he said. ""But we have to distinguish the civilians from the terrorist groups."" U.N. Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said on Thursday there was a high concentration of foreign fighters in Idlib, including an estimated 10,000 who he said belonged to Nusra Front and al Qaeda. But he said there should be no rush to military action and called for more time for Russia, Turkey and Iran to discuss the situation in Idlib. The decision to add Tahrir al-Sham to the list of designated groups was taken by President Tayyip Erdogan. Ankara had already listed Nusra Front as a terrorist group. Erdogan is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at a three-way summit in Iran on Sept. 7."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"France clamps down on radical Islam in prisons, schools"	"PARIS, Feb 23 ? The French government said today it would seal off extremists within prisons and open new centres to reintegrate returning jihadists into society as part of a plan to halt the spread of radical Islam. France is experimenting with various ways of ending the drift towards extremism of young people growing up on the margins of society, in predominantly immigrant suburbs where organisations like the Islamic State group or Al-Qaeda recruit. The plan unveiled today is the third in four years and aims to draw lessons from past failures, after three years marked by a series of attacks that left over 240 people dead. “No one has a magic formula for ‘deradicalisation’ as if you might de-install dangerous software,” Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said in the northern city of Lille where he presented his strategy, flanked by a dozen ministers. “But in France and elsewhere there are good approaches to prevention and disengagement.” France is particularly keen to stop extremism flourishing in its prisons, where some of the jihadists behind attacks in recent years first came under the spell of hardliners. A total of 512 people are currently serving time for terrorism offences in France and a further 1,139 prisoners have been flagged up as being radicalised. To prevent extremism spreading further, Philippe said he would create 1,500 places in separate prison wings “especially for radicalised inmates”. He also announced plans for three new centres that will attempt to reintegrate radicals referred by French courts, including jihadists returning from fallen IS strongholds in the Middle East. A first de-radicalisation trial ended in failure last July, with a centre in western France that operated on a voluntary basis shutting after less than a year with no improvements to show. ? Investments in psychological care for returning children of jihadists. So far 68 children have been repatriated, most of them under 13. ? Tighter controls on private Islamic schools which have grown rapidly in number in recent years. ? More training for teachers to help them detect early signs of radicalisation and to debunk conspiracy theories. ? More investment in teaching students to separate fact from rumour on the internet. ? Making it easier to reassign public servants that show signs of radicalisation to jobs that do not involve contact with the public."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Pakistan takes radical Sunni leader off terrorist watchlist ahead of election	" ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has removed the leader of one of the country's largest Islamist extremist groups from its terrorist watchlist while the Election Commission considers whether his group can field candidates in a general election next month, an official said on Thursday. Muhammad Ahmed Ludhianvi is head of Ahl-e-Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ), a radical Sunni group that has incited violence against Pakistan's minority Shi'ite Muslims. ASWJ shares roots with the more violent Lashkar-e-Jhangvi militant group based in central Punjab province, which had strong ties to al Qaeda and has waged a deadly campaign against Shi'ites for more than two decades. Who authorised the removal of Ludhianvi from the terrorist list is unclear, as a caretaker government is running Pakistan during the two months of campaigning ahead of the July 25 general election. The ASWJ has registered dozens of candidates to stand in poll, using another name for their party, but their candidacy has been challenged because of the group's inclusion on the terrorist watchlist. Hasan Askari Rizvi, the caretaker chief minister of Punjab province, confirmed the removal of the ban on Ludhianvi and said his assets would be unfrozen and he would be free to travel. ""Punjab Government is implementing decisions of Election Commission and the federal government in this regard,"" Rizvi told Reuters. ""The election commission will decide today in a meeting whether his group can contest the election."" The election pits the former ruling party of ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif - who was disqualified from office last year by the Supreme Court - against opposition figure Imran Khan's party as well as the Pakistan People's Party led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardar, the son of assassinated leader Benazir Bhutto. Islamist parties have seldom had a major impact at elections, though they have created a high profile and possess a solid vote bank and have at times, according to analysts, enjoyed covert support from Pakistan's intelligence agencies. Ludhianvi has made forays into politics before. The Sunni cleric is best known for fomenting hatred against the country's minority Shi'ites, but he has recently shown signs of seeking to rehabilitate his group's image. Earlier this year, he was one of more than 1,800 Pakistani Muslim clerics who signed an Islamic directive, or fatwa, forbidding suicide bombings, in a book unveiled by the government. He was a leader of Sipah-e-Sahaba (SSP), a sectarian Sunni group which emerged in the southern Punjab area of Jhang in the mid-1980s with the support of Pakistani intelligence and which was later linked to hundreds of killings of Shi’ites. A splinter group of SSP, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ), evolved into one of Pakistan’s most feared militant groups and has claimed responsibility for many attacks on Shi’ites, including a series of bombings that killed almost 200 people in the southwestern city of Quetta in 2013."

Easy for them to blend in': Foreign terror suspects pose security challenges for Malaysian authorities	"KUALA LUMPUR: When Malaysian police announced the arrest of eight terror suspects last Friday (Nov 16), it highlighted a particular problem authorities here face. That of foreigners entering Malaysia legally but who then go on to pursue militant activities. Seven of the eight suspects arrested last week were Filipinos, with some of them working in the country as labourers or construction workers in the eastern state of Sabah. The police said they were suspected of various activities, including recruiting children in the Philippines to be used as human shields and kidnap-for-ransom activities. The latest raids brought the total number of terror suspects arrested in Malaysia since 2013 to 445. More than a quarter of them - 128 - were foreigners. Some of these foreigners were directly involved in a number of attacks that were being planned by extremists, according to authorities. “We have foiled 23 terror attacks since 2013 - out of which three of those plots involved foreigners,” Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay, head of Malaysia's Special Branch counter-terrorism division, told Channel NewsAsia. The three plots, involving two Filipinos and two Indonesians, were disrupted in 2015, 2017 and 2018, said Ayob, who declined to elaborate further. Last year, Malaysian police said they had foiled a plan by the Abu Sayyaf Group to attack the closing ceremony of the Southeast Asian Games in Kuala Lumpur. The foreign suspects who have been arrested over the years have either been members or had ties with Islamic State (IS), Al-Qaeda, Pakistan’s Lashkar e-Taiba - the group behind the 2008 Mumbai attack - Abu Sayyaf, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and others. Filipinos comprised the largest group of foreign militants with 46 suspects detained, most of whom were alleged to be from the Abu Sayyaf, Ayob said. Indonesians represent the second largest group with 35 people arrested. Of the 445 terror suspects arrested since 2013, 189 suspects were charged in court with 161 of those convicted and jailed. Another 114 were freed, while 50 foreign terror suspects were deported, said the Special Branch. With police constantly on the trail of suspected foreign terror suspects, experts suggest that there are a number of factors which make Malaysia a popular destination for extremists looking to pursue activities outside their own countries. ""Malaysia is regarded as a Muslim-friendly country; also, visas are not needed for some Middle Easterners. This is exploited by foreign terrorist fighters,"" said counter-terrorism expert Ahmad el-Muhammady. ""And it's easy for them to blend in given the fact that many Middle Eastern communities are in Malaysia."" He added: ""There should also be better vetting of arrivals from Arab countries with well-trained (immigration) officers (who can speak) Arabic."" A former intelligence official, who investigated the 9/11 operatives who came to  Malaysia in 1999, told Channel NewsAsia it was not surprising that Al-Qaeda members were still coming to Malaysia. ""It shouldn't surprise us anymore,"" he said, requesting anonymity. ""It's easy to enter this country and lie low for a period of time. It could also suggest they have a support network here."" Foreign terrorists come to Malaysia for myriad reasons: Some are on the run from authorities in their own countries, some are seeking to raise funds. “Terror groups like Al-Qaeda have their own funds while JI and IS exploit the issue of oppression against Muslims to collect funds in Malaysia,” said Ayob. Adding to the challenge for the intelligence forces is the suspicion that Malaysia’s borders are more porous than they should be because of corrupt officials who do not conduct the proper security checks. ""It is imperative for the government to look into corruption at the entry and exit points of the country,"" said counter-terrorism expert Ahmad. In March 2017, police arrested an immigration officer in Sandakan, Sabah who allegedly helped arrange for IS militants from Indonesia and Malaysia to enter the eastern state before heading on to southern Philippines. And in September this year, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission arrested six immigration officers who allegedly assisted about 15 human smuggling syndicates to enable blacklisted locals and foreigners, including hardcore criminals, to enter and exit via Kuala Lumpur International Airport and other international airports in the country. On Nov 15, Malaysian police said that shortcomings in the immigration department's e-visa system had resulted in some people being allowed to enter the country despite being blacklisted or having criminal records. Deputy inspector-general of police Noor Rashid Ibrahim was quoted by Bernama as saying the weaknesses could pose a major threat to the country. ""So far, we are still collecting information and making analysis,"" he said. ""When the information is enough, we will conduct a special operation."" Recent arrests have shown that some terror suspects have managed to live and work undetected for years before being caught by police. Some of them set up their own companies either to hide their activities or to eke out a living while on the run from authorities back home. Others have worked as security guards, construction workers or petty traders. At least seven Abu Sayyaf members were working as security guards when they were arrested, according to police. The Philippines-based Abu Sayyaf is an IS-linked kidnap-for-ransom group known for beheading its victims when they fail to pay ransoms. Some foreign militants have worked as teachers spreading radical Salafi jihadi teachings, which underpin global terrorist groups like IS and Al-Qaeda. On Sep 24, police arrested seven foreigners and one Malaysian for spreading Salafi jihadi teachings in the northern state of Perlis. The foreigners comprised five Europeans, one American and a Middle Easterner. The threat from foreign extremists who are Al-Qaeda members or those who have links with the organisation is a growing concern for Malaysian authorities. Last October, the Special Branch arrested a 50-year-old former Al-Qaeda member in Selangor. The detained Egyptian suspect was an executive manager in an advertising company that he had set up. His firm promotes a property company from a Gulf state. “At this point, we only know that he set up his own company here. Investigations are still ongoing,” said counter-terrorism chief Ayob. Inspector-General of Police Mohd Fuzi Harun also said that the suspect had previously been jailed in Canada and Egypt for his involvement in terror activities and for using fake travel documents. “We need to conduct operations to disrupt Al-Qaeda because they have tried to use Malaysia as a base to plot their terror attacks,” said Ayob. ""Previously, the operatives of the 9/11 attacks quietly entered Malaysia in December 1999 to discuss the plot and then left and made their way to the US to carry out the attack in 2001."" In 1995, a senior Al-Qaeda member, Wali Khan Amin Shah, a co-conspirator in the plot to blow up 12 US-registered airliners in Asia, was also arrested in Malaysia. “Wali Khan had set up a company in Malaysia named Konsojaya Sendirian Berhad as a cover for his terror activities in Malaysia,” said Ayob, who investigated the case. Ayob warned of an Al-Qaeda resurgence as he called for vigilance. ""We have intel that shows that Al-Qaeda is strengthening its forces and their strategy is to be active again after the fall of IS.”"	Terrorism	Terrorism
Jihadists pull heavy weapons from Syria buffer zone as deadline nears	"Jihadist factions including Syria’s former Al-Qaeda branch have withdrawn heavy weapons from parts of a planned buffer zone in Idlib province, a monitor said Monday, two days ahead of a deadline. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham “and other less influential jihadist groups have withdrawn their heavy weapons from large areas of the demilitarised zone” ringing Idlib province, said Rami Abdel Rahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The development comes ahead of Wednesday’s cut-off date for all rebels to withdraw heavy arms from a 15 to 20-kilometre (9-12 mile) demilitarised area ringing the Idlib region. The creation of a buffer zone is central to an agreement reached last month by regime ally Russia and rebel backer Turkey, which is aimed at staving off a massive assault on Idlib by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces. The deal also foresees radical groups leaving the area by October 15. HTS, which is led by former Al-Qaeda fighters, has yet to comment on its reported withdrawal or announce its stance on the buffer zone deal. According to the Britain-based Observatory, the pullout quietly began two days ago. “Until now, heavy weapons have been removed from northern Hama and eastern Idlib” located in the proposed zone, Abdel Rahman said. The Idlib region includes most of the province of the same name, as well as adjacent parts of the Hama and Aleppo provinces. In recent weeks, Turkey has deployed troops at “observation posts” it set up in rebel-held areas of Idlib and neighboring Aleppo. A local source close to HTS said Ankara’s actions demonstrated that neither Turkey, Russia, nor fellow regime ally Iran plan to break the deal. “The presence of Turkish forces and their posts will prevent any military action,” the source said. “So (HTS), like other factions, is moving heavy weapons and reinforcing its positions according to the agreement.” The source confirmed each faction “will remain in its position”, indicating that HTS and the other groups were “ready and prepared” to rebel any attack by the regime. HTS and other hardliners hold a large part of Idlib province and the proposed demilitarised zone, while the National Liberation Front is the main Turkey-backed rebel alliance in the area. On Monday, the NLF completed withdrawing heavy arms from the zone, according to Turkish state media. The start of the NLF pullout was confirmed to AFP by its spokesman Naji Mustafa. Despite progress in implementing the terms of the deal, Assad on Sunday said the arrangement would not become permanent. “The agreement is a temporary measure through which the state has realized many achievements on the ground starting with stemming the bloodshed,” he was quoted as saying by state news agency SANA. “This province and other Syrian territories still under terrorist control will return to the Syrian state,” the president said, referring to both rebels and jihadists. Forces loyal to Assad have retaken swathes of territory in Syria since Russia entered the war in September 2015. Air strikes attributed to Russia have killed more than 18,000 people since its intervention, according to the Observatory. The Syrian civil war has killed more than 360,000 people since it started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests."	Terrorism	Terrorism
" Russia-Turkey alliance surviving Idlib test, for now"	" ISTANBUL, Aug 28 — Russia and Turkey are in intense negotiations to ensure the rebel-held province of Idlib does not become a breaking point in their alliance on Syria, but the long term fate of the area still risks provoking a rupture, analysts say. President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan have spearheaded an unlikely but so far sustained partnership to bring peace to Syria since late 2016, despite being in theory on opposite sides of the civil war. The cooperation now faces its biggest test over Syria’s northwestern province of Idlib, bordering Turkey, which Syrian President Bashar al-Assad wants to recapture to complete a string of military successes. Idlib has over the last years become an increasingly densely-populated region where problems in resolving the seven-year Syrian civil war were effectively dumped to be resolved at a later date. That moment is now drawing closer with expectations of a government offensive and fears over the combustible mix in the province of displaced people from other Syrian regions, moderate rebels and Islamist radicals. Erdogan has been a champion of the anti-Assad rebels and bitterly denounced Putin in the crisis that followed the shooting down of a Russian war plane by Turkey in November 2015. But the burgeoning alliance with Moscow, which also includes cooperation in trade, energy and defence, is now of critical importance to Ankara at a time when a crisis in relations with the US has caused the Turkish lira to bleed value. “There is still a hope in Moscow to find an agreement with Ankara that could allow the Syrian regime to take control of Idlib without a new rupture with Turkey,” Kerim Has, a Moscow-based analyst on Turkish-Russian relations, told AFP. He said Moscow was carefully watching Turkey-US ties and could launch a full operation at the “moment when the Turkish leadership is in most desperate need of the Kremlin’s encouragement during a deepening Turkey-US crisis.” Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu on Friday led a delegation including Defence Minister Hulusi Akar and spy chief Hakan Fidan to Moscow to discuss the Idlib situation and also Moscow’s planned delivery of S-400 missile systems to Turkey. Cavusoglu warned that a “military solution” in Idlib, which he said is now home to 3.5 million people, would be a “catastrophe” and provoke a new refugee influx into Turkey where three million Syrians already live. But he also said “radical groups and terrorists” in Idlib should be “neutralised”, in comments seen as indicating Ankara could support a limited intervention. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said a differentiation should be made between moderate rebels and extremists, like the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group (HTS) who control much of Idlib. In a sign of the importance of the visit, Cavusoglu was received by President Putin, who praised the “deep cooperation” over Syria. Cavusoglu told Putin “your dear friend Mr Erdogan” expected him in Istanbul soon for dinner at a fish restaurant. “Russia and Turkey are trying to find agreement with suitable terms for both sides,” Timur Akhmetov, Ankara-based researcher at the Russian International Affairs Council, told AFP. He predicted Russia and the Syrian regime would launch a “limited offensive” against groups linked to former al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front — especially on factions that have irritated Moscow by launching swarm attacks with drones against its Hmeimim base, the heart of Russian operations in Syria. “Russia is trying to encourage Turkey to have the opposition contribute to the offensive and in return, these groups will be spared from air attacks,” Akhmetov added. Yet, as has been the case repeatedly for Idlib, a limited offensive will only temporarily sidestep the key issue, namely who will control the province long-term and eventually postwar. And even if Russia can agree a compromise, it is not always the case that Assad automatically follows Moscow’s line or that his other main ally Iran backs the Kremlin. “The Russians and the Turks will be hard pressed to reach a sustainable, long-term agreement acceptable to the regime in northwestern Syria,” Elizabeth Teoman, Turkey analyst for the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), told AFP. Turkey has set up 12 so-called observation points in Idlib staffed by its military, ostensibly aimed at monitoring a de-escalation zone but which also serve to protect Ankara’s interests. Teoman said Erdogan could contemplate a possible limited offensive — with Russian and Turkish interests overlapping for now on limiting a refugee influx and promoting reconstruction in Idlib. She said the current discussions likely did not represent an “imminent breaking point” between Moscow and Ankara but warned: “Turkey’s aspirations are in direct opposition to Assad’s goals to crush the remnants of the Syrian rebellion.”"	Terrorism	Terrorism
Deadline passes for Syria’s Idlib buffer without jihadists leaving	" IDLIB, Oct 15 — A deadline passed this morning without jihadists leaving a planned buffer zone around Syria’s last major rebel bastion of Idlib as set out under a Russian-Turkish deal. The radical fighters were supposed to withdraw from the buffer as a final condition to implementing a Russian-Turkish deal to stave off a regime offensive on the northwestern region of Idlib. The accord hung in the balance on the early hours of this morning, seven years into a grinding civil war that has killed more than 360,000 people and displaced millions. Just hours before the cut-off time, Idlib’s dominant jihadist group vowed to continue to fight but did not give a clear position on the deal reached in the Russia resort of Sochi. “We have not abandoned our choice of jihad and fighting towards implementing our blessed revolution,” said Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an alliance led by the jihadists of Al-Qaeda’s former Syrian affiliate. “We appreciate the efforts of all those who strive inside and abroad to protect the liberated area,” it said in an apparent reference to Turkey. “But at the same time, we warn of the deceitfulness of the Russian occupier,” it said of the regime’s ally. Under the accord, heavy weapons were meant to have been withdrawn from the horseshoe-shaped buffer by October 10 and radical fighters were meant to have left by this morning. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it had not observed any jihadists leaving the outlined demilitarised area by the time midnight struck. And deadly mortar rounds fired late Saturday from the planned buffer, according to the Britain-based monitor, appeared to indicate the first part of the deal was not fully implemented either. “The jihadists not withdrawing gives the regime and Russia an excuse to carry out a military operation at least within the demilitarised zone,” Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said. HTS had likely “tried to gain time by neither explicitly refusing nor accepting the deal” between Russia and Turkey, he said. Sam Heller, an analyst at the International Crisis Group, on Twitter said the HTS announcement appeared to be a “tacit agreement of the Sochi deal”. “HTS emphasizes its responsibility and flexibility (within limits), which seemingly adds up to a tacit acceptance of the Sochi deal,” he wrote. Late Saturday, “heavy mortar shells” were fired from the planned buffer area into regime territory, killing two soldiers, the Observatory said. Rebels and jihadists had reportedly fulfilled the first part of the deal, with Turkish officials, armed factions and the Observatory reporting that the area was free of heavy-duty weaponry. But the shells which Saturday hit an army position in Hama province appear to have violated the accord. But it was unclear which groups fired the mortars late Saturday, it said, as both the Turkish-backed National Liberation Front and rival jihadist factions were present in the area. The NLF — which holds just under half of the Idlib region and has welcomed the accord — did not immediately respond to AFP’s request for comment on the shelling. The lion’s share of Idlib is held by HTS, as well as more hardline jihadists like Hurras al-Deen and Ansar al-Islam. Those fighters also control more than two-thirds of the planned buffer zone and are supposed to withdraw by this morning. Hurras al-Deen has publicly rejected the agreement, although it apparently withdrew its heavy arms from the area last week. HTS, widely considered the most powerful force in Idlib, had quietly abided by the deal’s first deadline and re-stationed heavy arms elsewhere. But getting them to agree to the second part of the deal has proven more difficult. In a recent report for the Turkey-based Omran Center, expert Nawar Oliver described HTS’s approval as the deal’s ultimate “test”. “If HTS acts as a spoiler to the agreement on the ground, this will probably lead to one of two scenarios: either Turkey and the NLF launch military action against HTS, or Russia will seize the opportunity with the support of the regime and its allies to enter Idlib,” he said. “The ramifications of that move could be vast,” he added. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and other top government officials have warned that the Idlib deal was only a “temporary” measure. On Friday, residents around Idlib received warning messages on their mobile phones from the Syrian army. “Get away from the fighters. Their fate is sealed and near,” one said."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Jihadist group rejects deal for Syria’s Idlib, main faction yet to declare stance"	"BEIRUT (Reuters) – A jihadist faction in the Idlib region of northwestern Syria has rejected a Turkish-Russian deal that requires “radical” insurgents to withdraw from a demilitarized zone, and urged rebels to launch new military operations. While the Huras al-Din faction is not the main Islamist militant group in Idlib, its statement points to objections that may complicate the implementation of the agreement clinched last week by Russia and Turkey. The most powerful jihadist group in the northwest, Tahrir al-Sham, has yet to declare its stance on the deal, under which insurgents must vacate the demilitarized zone by Oct. 15. Tahrir al-Sham is a coalition of Islamist groups dominated by the faction formerly known as the Nusra Front, which was an official wing of the al Qaeda network until 2016. Tahrir al-Sham’s position will be critical. An alliance of Turkey-allied rebel groups, the National Front for Liberation, has declared its “complete cooperation” with the Turkish effort, but has also ruled out disarming or yielding territory. The Huras al-Din group was formed earlier this year by combatants who split from Tahrir al-Sham and the Nusra Front when it cut its ties with al Qaeda. It includes foreign militants. The group declared the agreement part of a plan “to eliminate the jihadist project” in the Levant. “We advise our mujahideen brothers in this decisive and dangerous phase … (to) begin military operations against the enemies of religion to thwart their plans,” it said in a statement released on Saturday. The demilitarized zone agreed by Turkey and Russia will be 15 to 20 km (10 to 12 miles) deep and run along the contact line between rebel and government fighters. It will be patrolled by Turkish and Russian forces. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that all opposition heavy weapons, mortars, tanks and rocket systems are to be removed from the zone by Oct. 10. Close to 3 million people live in Idlib, around half of them Syrians displaced by the war from other parts of Syria, and the United Nations has warned that an offensive would cause a humanitarian catastrophe."

"Syrian rebels see Idlib deal as victory, Damascus as test for Turkey"	" AMMAN/BEIRUT (Reuters) – Syrian opposition officials praised a deal between Russia and Turkey over Idlib province on Tuesday, saying it had spared the rebel-held region a bloody government offensive and would thwart President Bashar al-Assad’s aim of recovering all Syria. Damascus, while welcoming the agreement unveiled on Monday, vowed to press on with its campaign to recover “every inch” of the country. Its ambassador to Lebanon said the deal would test Turkey’s ability to deliver on promises to disarm rebels. Russian President Vladimir Putin, Assad’s most powerful ally, and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan agreed at a summit on Monday to create a demilitarized zone in Idlib from which “radical” rebels must withdraw by the middle of next month. The agreement has diminished the prospects of a Syrian government offensive which the United Nations warned would create a humanitarian catastrophe in the Idlib region, home to about three million people. The Idlib region and adjoining territory north of Aleppo represents the Syrian opposition’s last big foothold in Syria, where Iranian and Russian military support has helped Assad recover most of the areas once held by the insurgency. But strong Turkish opposition to an Idlib attack has obstructed government plans for an offensive, and the agreement announced on Monday appears to preserve a role for Turkey in the northwest – something seen as anathema to Assad. “The Idlib deal preserves lives of civilians and their direct targeting by the regime. It buries Assad’s dreams of imposing his full control over Syria,” Mustafa Sejari, a Free Syria Army (FSA) official, told Reuters. “This area will remain in the hands of the Free Syrian Army and will force the regime and its supporters to start a serious political process that leads to a real transition that ends Assad’s rule,” Sejari said. The spokesman for the opposition Syrian Negotiations Commission said the deal had halted an offensive for which government forces had been mobilizing in recent weeks, calling it a “victory for the will for life over the will for death”. The “scenario of attack is practically excluded, at least for a period of time that is not small, and we hope that it will be permanent,” Yahya al-Aridi told Reuters by telephone. Syria’s ambassador to Lebanon, in an interview with Lebanon’s al-Jadeed TV, reiterated his government’s distrust of Turkey, a major backer of the Syrian rebellion which has deployed troops across the opposition-held northwest. “I see it as a test of the extent of Turkey’s ability to commit to implementing this decision. They are under pressure now and I believe they will try,” Ali Abdul Karim said. “We do not trust Turkey … but it’s useful for Turkey to be able to carry out this fight to rid these groups from their weapons…Turkey could deal with this responsibility and this would be useful,” he said. The demilitarized zone will be monitored by Russian and Turkish forces, the leaders said on Monday. Neither Putin not Erdogan explained how they planned to differentiate “radically-minded” rebels from other anti-Assad groups. It was also not immediately clear how much of the city of Idlib fell within the zone. Putin said the decision was to establish by Oct. 15 a demilitarized area 15–20 km (10-12 miles) deep along the contact line between rebel and government fighters, with radical militants to be withdrawn from the area, including members of the Nusra Front, a jihadist group that now part of the Tahrir al-Sham organization. Al-Watan, a pro-Syrian government newspaper, said on Tuesday the zone would stretch for 15 km around Idlib city. It also said Syrian state institutions would return to Idlib by the end of the year in the final phase of the deal after insurgents hand over all of their heavy weapons and move away from civilian areas. Citing unidentified diplomatic sources in Moscow, it said any factions rejecting the agreement would be considered enemies “even of the Turkish army and will be classed as terrorists that must be fought”. Erdogan, who had feared another cross-border exodus of Syrian refugees to join the 3.5 million already in Turkey, said the deal would allow opposition supporters to stay where they were and avert a humanitarian crisis. Putin said that by Oct. 10, all opposition heavy weapons, mortars, tanks, rocket systems would be removed from the demilitarized zone, and said this was Erdogan’s suggestion. Earlier this month, Putin publicly rebuffed a proposal from Erdogan for a ceasefire when the two met along with Iran’s president for a summit in Tehran. Idlib is held by an array of rebels. The most powerful is Tahrir al-Sham, an amalgamation of Islamist groups dominated by the former Nusra Front – an al Qaeda affiliate until 2016. Other Islamists, and groups fighting as the Free Syrian Army banner, are now gathered with Turkish backing under the banner of the “National Front for Liberation”."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Germany holds suspected former bin Laden bodyguard pending deportation	"BERLIN: A Tunisian man suspected of being an Islamist radical who once served as Osama bin Laden's bodyguard is in detention in Germany pending deportation to Tunisia, a spokesman for the city of Bochum said on Tuesday. The case of Sami A. sparked outrage in April after German media reported he was receiving welfare benefits even though intelligence agencies had classified him as a potential threat. Police said on Monday that they had arrested Sami A. after being asked to do so by authorities in the western city of Bochum and he had offered no resistance. Peter van Dyk, a spokesman for the city of Bochum, said on Tuesday that Sami A. had appeared before a judge on Monday who had decided the suspect should be placed in detention pending deportation. Van Dyk said the city of Bochum had on Monday received a notification from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) saying that they no longer considered there to be obstacles to his deportation. German authorities have been trying to deport the man, who has lived in the northwestern city of Bochum since 1997, since 2006 but the threat of torture in his home country had prevented this, according to a previous report in Bild. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has ordered immigration authorities to expedite proceedings that would allow Germany to deport Sami A. Bin Laden was a founder and leader of the militant Islamist movement al-Qaeda which carried out many attacks on U.S. and other Western targets including the September 11 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York.

"Indonesia church attacker wanted to join IS in Syria, cops say"	" JAKARTA, Feb 12 — The Indonesian who attacked a church congregation with a sword during Sunday Mass is a radical Islamist who had wanted to fight with the Islamic State group in Syria, police said today. Around 100 people were attending the service at a Catholic church in Yogyakarta province on Java island when Suliyono, 23, barged in wielding a one-metre-long sword and began attacking terror-stricken people, seemingly indiscriminately. Four people, including 81-year-old German-born priest Edmund Prier who was standing at the altar, were seriously injured. The extremist, who was later shot in the leg after ignoring a police warning shot, also decapitated a Virgin Mary statue with his sword. “Suliyono had made a passport application as he attempted to go to Syria, but the application failed. He ended up launching the attack here,” said national police chief Tito Karnavian. He said police are still investigating whether Suliyono was a “lone wolf terrorist” or part of a group. Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-populated country, is also home to significant numbers of Christians, Hindus and Buddhists but there are concerns over rising intolerance. Extremists have mounted a series of attacks against Christians and other minorities. In 2016 several children were injured after a man threw Molotov cocktails at a church during a Sunday service. On 2000 Christmas Eve, the al-Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah group staged coordinated bombings of churches in Jakarta and eight other cities which killed 18 people and injured many more.

The root causes of terrorism — Paneir Selvam	"Recently IGP Tan Sri Mohamed Fuzi Harun stated that seven terrorists were arrested in Sabah and all of them are members of the Abu Sayyaf group (ASG) which vigorously involved in kidnapping for ransom. One of the terrorists is known to have decapitation the hostages. In addition, Sabah CPO Datuk Omar Mammah also pointed out that the members of ASG trying to hide in Sabah and in meantime other terrorist groups also pose security threat by using Sabah as a hiding place. The statements made by both the IGP and CPO indicated that terrorist groups like ASG, Al Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and ISIS already have support base in this country. Additionally, a research firm has identified that an emergent number of Malaysians are supporting and be tolerance for terrorist activities in the name of religion. How these terrorist groups are able to penetrate and influence the locals in this country? Do the supporters and sympathisers of these groups are willing to risk their safety and freedom by providing safe houses for these terrorists? What had motivated them to support these terrorists whose intention to destroy this nation? Who has instigated them to act against Malaysia? What are the root causes which have influenced them to act in such a manner? A few days ago, shortly after the Asean-US Summit, US Vice President Mike Pence agreed with Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad’s narrative on terrorism that the root causes of terrorism need to be identified and resolved which will eliminate the threats posed by the terrorist groups globally. Last September at the 73rd UN general Assembly, Dr Mahathir had stressed that terrorism could be resolved if the international community especially the West recognise Palestine as a sovereign state and preventing the Israel regime from murdering Palestinians. By recognising Jerusalem as a capital of Israel by US President Donald Trump and its allies worsen the current efforts done by the international community to resolve this issue amiably. Apart from that the fulfillments of the key agreements according to the Oslo Accords by the Israel and Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) will be a paramount solution by recognising an independent state of Palestine and right of the Palestinians to self-determination which were in accordance with the UN’s Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. Most of the Salafi Jihadism based terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda, ISIS, JI, Boko Haram, Hizbul Mujahideen, Al-Ashtar Brigades (AAB), Jama’at Nusrat al_Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) and other similar groups are depicting the issue of Palestine as their main propaganda tool to recruit the potential terrorists. These so-called terrorists are sympathising with the suffering of Palestinians initially and later with the indoctrination of hate preachers they become hardcore terrorists. An Australian newspaper, Herald Sun recently reported that Amir Milson, a model once voted as the Malaysia’s Bachelor of the year was killed in Syria after he joined ISIS. As a young ordinary man who has world at his feet, Amir has died as a jihadist. Where was he radicalised? Who were his acquaintances before he was radicalised? Did he attend a particular madrassah/surau/mosque? What has make him to transform himself as a jihadist? Did he attend any hate preaches’ sermons or talks? I suspect Amir was brainwashed in the name of religion by his handlers who are posed as genuine religious teachers and preachers. These handlers/terrorists are disguised themselves as teachers and preachers. But actually they are hate preachers who willing destroy a nation to espouse their ideology. They can be a serious threat to our national security if we as Malaysians are unwilling to recognise and ignore them because of the sensitivity. For hate preachers the rule of law is dubious and extraneous. They are indoctrinated with false ideology which was misinterpreted from religious text. The current security dilemma confront by Malaysia is very much similar with the situation in United Kingdom now. Before the London bombing in 2005, the UK security forces through their network of intelligence received some information regarding with terrorist threats but failed to take the warning seriously. The perception is changed utterly after the bombings in London. Later the investigation reports have indicated that the terrorists who are involved with such attacks have been indoctrinated the ideology of Salafism by the hate preachers. These hate preachers who are wanted by Jordan and Egypt were given political asylum by UK and later they become the ideological masters for the present and future home grown terrorists in UK. The contemporary paradigm of global terrorist attacks is well linked with the hate preachers. The recent London and Manchester attacks are connected with the hate preachers in UK. The role of the hate preachers is to instigate their supporters and followers especially the young people and the converts to get involved with terrorist related activities. Generally, these hate preachers disguised themselves as the innocent or genuine preachers but their motives will be unknown to their acquaintances. These preachers will filter and choose the listeners or followers by picking up the people who have committed a lot of “sins.” They will not always have involved with attacks directly but rather as the inspirational figures to motivate and urge terrorists to commit the act. The current UK security debacle is started many years ago. The influx of foreign radical hate preachers who are allowed to stay and continue their “noble” activities in UK is the primary cause of the current problem. The people who sanctioned these hate preachers to be in UK probably never anticipated such atrocities which took placed in London or in Manchester. Most of them are policymakers who have no knowledge on security matters. In addition, they decide such delicate matters on the basis of human rights which is wrong approach to take on. These radical hate preachers can destroy a nation with help of people within. Omar Bakri Muhammad and Mustafa Kamel Mustafa also known as Abu Hamza had been convicted for radicalising British born young persons and the new converts. Further, they play a crucial role to groom another local radical hate preacher, Anjem Choudary who is a former solicitor to continue their cause in UK. Further, with the help of Omar, Anjem founded al-Muhajiroun. This organization was banned under the UK Terrorism Act 2000 because of its terrorist related activities. The Woolwich attacker Michael Adebolajo and Khuram Butt, the London Bridge terrorist, are associated with al-Muhajiroun. All the current attacks that happened in UK directly or indirectly are connected to these hate preachers. Therefore, another such attack is imminent in UK. In addition, they have created sleeper cells throughout UK and these cells will be operated as a factory which will produce British born terrorists. Even though in past, the UK security forces arrested and prosecuted successfully these terrorists but the attacks still occurred because of the influence of people like Omar, Abu Hamza and Anjem in UK. Malaysia is not far from the UK’s security situation. The Malaysia security and intelligence forces have captured the suspected terrorists of ISIS, Al Qaeda and JI. But in my opinion, the real threat pose by hate preachers and their supporters/sympathisers will be noxious. That’s because their appearance and conduct will encourage ordinary people to donate and much easier for them to recruit the potential terrorists. Further the self-radicalised terrorists who are influenced by the hate radical preachers in Malaysia can create an austere security threat in near future. The present security dilemma in Malaysia is very much similar to the current situation in UK. Even though this possibility is discounted now but the potential is still there. In addition, the change of government can be used by these hate preachers to instigate Malaysians in the name of religion by creating a hostile environment to conduct future terrorist attacks. Since 1960s many radical groups like the Tentera Sabilullah (Holy War Army), the Golongan Rohaniah (Spiritual Group), the Koperasi Angkatan Revolusi Islam Malaysia (Malaysian Islamic Revolutionary Front-KARIM), the Kumpulan Crypto (Crypto Group), the Kumpulan Mohd Nasir Ismail (Mohd Nasir Ismail Group), the Kumpulan Revolusi Islam Ibrahim Libya (Ibrahim Libya Islamic Revolution Group), the Kumpulan Jundullah (Jundullah Group), the Kumpulan Mujahidin Kedah (Kedah Mujahidin Group), the Kumpulan Perjuangan Islam Perak (Perak Islamic Movement Group-KPIP), the Kumpulan Persaudaraan Ilmu dalam Al-Maunah (Brotherhood of AlMa’unah Inner Power), the Kumpulan Militan Malaysia (KMM) and the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) were activated in Malaysia. Most of these groups were successfully crippled by the PDRM. Except for JI, the other groups lost their influence and support in Malaysia. All of these groups either started or inspired by the teaching of radical religious teachers and hate preachers. The general goal of these militant groups is to create pure Islamic state and overthrow the government at the time. JI is the most important terrorist organization in South-east Asia. This group is originated from Indonesia and started by two radical religious clerics, i.e. Abdullah Sungkar and Abu Bakar Ba’asyir. In 1980s both of them migrated to Malaysia because of the harsh treatment of Suharto regime. They started off in Banting and later expanded their set-up to Kuala Pilah and Ulu Tiram. They conducted religious classes based on Salafi Jihadism ideology to establish Daulah Islamiyyah comprising of Malaysia, Indonesia, Southern Philippines, Singapore and Brunei. The most infamous Malaysians from this group are Yazid Sufaat, Dr Azhari Hussin and Nordin Mohd Top. The first two terrorists are graduated from USA universities. Their transformation from western educated graduates to hardcore terrorists had perplexed many Malaysians. Dr Azhari and Nordin Mohd Top heavily involved with terrorist activities in Indonesia like Bali Bombing in 2002. At one point of time both of them become the most wanted terrorists in South-east Asia. After JI was incapacitated, ISIS become the most dangerous terrorist group in Malaysia. Zid Saharani Mohd, Lothfi Ariffin, Mohd Rafi Udin, Zainuri Kamaruddin and Muhammad Wanndy Mohamed Jedi were the important members of ISIS from Malaysia. All of them are believed to be killed in Syria and Iraq while they are engaging with terrorist activities. Many of these terrorists are from KMM then to JI and finally ended up as the members of ISIS. Therefore, the role played by radical religious teachers and hate preachers to transform them as the hardcore terrorists need to take a serious notice by the intelligence and security forces in Malaysia. The hate preachers are the source of inspiration to the terrorists globally because they are charismatic. They also have the capability to influence, manipulate and instigate the potential terrorists to launch the attacks by using false interpretations of the religion verses for their own benefit. To eliminate the threat of these hate preachers, the root causes of terrorism need to be resolved. The Palestine issue need be settled perpetually. That’s because all the hate preachers are using this issue to get support from the general public and some members of public later become supporters/sympathisers/terrorists. In conclusion, terrorism is not limited only to Muslims. In other faith believers’ terrorism do exist. It is not the fault of the religion or its believers. It is culpability of a small group of people who had misinterpreted the religious texts to gain power and fame. They called themselves as teachers, clerics and preachers. They are egocentric people. They don’t believe in peace and harmony. They subscribed false ideology based on the misguided interpretations of the religious texts and brainwashed others to commit terrorist acts in the name of the religion. In most cases, they themselves will not sacrificed for the cause but rather encourage others especially their students and supporters to do so. Therefore, the security and intelligence agencies in Malaysia have a huge task ahead. They need to work relentlessly to counter any terrorist attacks in Malaysia. Further they also have to identify, monitor and deter these hate preachers from any gains or any stimulus within the Malaysian society. In addition, the government through its religious agencies need to monitor the activities of these preachers and if they pose any threat to the national unity and security then they need to be reprimanded. * R.

Financier of Islamic State paid money to rebel group in eastern Congo	"KINSHASA: An Islamist rebel group in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo received money from a financier linked to Islamic State, suggesting tentative ties between the Congo insurgents and other jihadists in Africa and beyond, a report said on Thursday. Islamist ""financial facilitator"" Waleed Ahmed Zein paid the Allied Democratic Forces at least once, said the report from New York University's Congo Research Group and the Bridgeway Foundation that cited U.S. sources and an ADF defector. Zein is on a U.S. government sanctions list and was arrested in his home country of Kenya in July for links to Islamic State. The payments were made in recent years but it was not clear when, how much was paid or how the money was used. The Congolese government blames the ADF for a series of massacres in the last two years in the east of the country where violence around the city of Beni has hobbled efforts to contain an Ebola outbreak. The ADF was set up by Ugandan Muslims in the 1990s purporting to fight for the rights of the Tablighi Jamaat sect, although it turned to banditry after crossing Uganda's western border with Congo. The Congolese and Ugandan governments accuse the ADF of links with jihadists like al Qaeda but has offered little evidence to back up these claims. The payment was made as the ADF seeks to align itself with Islamic State, Nigeria-based Boko Haram and al Qaeda and other groups. ""The ADF appear to be ... becoming more interested in broadcasting their messages to a wider ... audience and are attempting to present themselves within a broader setting of radical jihadi groups,"" the report said. Links between the ADF and other groups are not yet strong, it said. Reuters was unable to independently verify the findings of the report. To reach a wider audience, the ADF has made propaganda videos which feature a flag similar to Islamic State's and broadcast in Luganda, Arabic, French, Kinyarwanda and Swahili, the region's most widely spoken language. They call for martyrdom and violence against infidels, the report said. Rival militia groups control parts of eastern Congo, long after the official end of a 1998-2003 war in which millions of people died, mostly from hunger and disease. Rights groups say the army is responsible for at least some of the recent killings in eastern Congo."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Jordanian court sentences nine militants in Karak shooting	"A court in Jordan on Tuesday sentenced nine militants to prison terms ranging from three years to life for a shooting rampage two years ago in an ancient castle in the southern city of Karak that killed 10 people, including a Canadian tourist. AMMAN: A court in Jordan on Tuesday sentenced nine militants to prison terms ranging from three years to life for a shooting rampage two years ago in an ancient castle in the southern city of Karak that killed 10 people, including a Canadian tourist. The court said the group of nine were involved in helping Islamist militants in attacks on the area surrounding an ancient crusader castle. The gunfights also left four militants dead. The state security court found them guilty of ""abetting terrorist acts that led to the death of human beings"" and committing ""terrorist acts using automatic weapons"". Militants from al Qaeda and other radical jihadist groups have long targeted the U.S.-allied kingdom and dozens of militants are currently serving long prison terms. King Abdullah, an ally of the Western powers against Islamist militancy and a defender of Jordan’s peace treaty with Israel, has been among the most vocal leaders in the region in warning of threats posed by radical groups. Jordan plays a prominent role in the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, providing military, logistical and intelligence support, according to Western diplomats and regional intelligence sources. Jordan has been relatively unscathed by the uprisings, civil wars and Islamist militancy that have swept the Middle East since 2011, but it maintains a high level of vigilance."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"9/11 co-organiser released from German jail, to be deported to Morocco"	"HAMBURG, GERMANY (REUTERS) - Mounir El Motassadeq, a friend of the September 11 hijackers who was sentenced to 15 years in a German prison in 2007 for being an accessory to mass murder, was deported to his native Morocco on Monday (Oct 15). One of only two men ever convicted in relation to the militant attacks of Sept 11, 2001 is being deported from his German prison, but it's unclear if this means freedom for him. El Motassadeq has served most of a 15-year sentence, the maximum sentence for being an accessory to mass murder. But German authorities have declined to say what happens to him next. It's thought he'll be taken to his native Morocco. But again, what would happen after hasn't been revealed. El Motassadeq was a member of a group radical Islamists in Hamburg who helped orchestrate the al Qaeda attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center. During his trial in 2007 his lawyers argued that he knew nothing of the plot. But prosecutors said at the time that he played a central role by handling the finances of several members."

"Jihadists fail to quit Syria buffer, throwing deal into doubt"	"Jihadists in Syria’s Idlib failed to meet a Monday deadline to leave a planned buffer zone ringing the country’s last rebel bastion, casting fresh doubt over a deal to avert bloodshed. A Russian-Turkish truce agreement reached nearly a month ago for the northwestern region gave “radical fighters” until October 15 to leave a proposed demilitarised area between government and opposition forces. The accord was a last-ditch effort to stave off a regime onslaught on Idlib, the largest rebel stronghold left in war-ravaged Syria and home to around three million people. But the target date for the withdrawal came and went without any hardliners leaving. “We did not document the withdrawal of any jihadist fighters from the entire demilitarised zone,” Rami Abdel Rahman, the head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor, said on Monday morning. Jihadists had until midnight Sunday to Monday to pull out, according to Abdel Rahman and two rebel commanders in Idlib. Syria’s government said it would take “time” to judge if the deal had failed. “We have to wait for the Russian reaction. Russia is monitoring and following the situation,” Foreign Minister Walid Muallem told reporters in Damascus. He said he hoped Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan would still be able to “fulfil the agreement from his part”. Hours before the cut-off time, Idlib’s jihadist heavyweight Hayat Tahrir al-Sham vowed to continue fighting. “We have not abandoned our choice of jihad and fighting towards implementing our blessed revolution,” said HTS, an alliance led by Al-Qaeda’s one-time Syria branch. HTS and other, more extreme jihadists hold over two-thirds of the planned buffer area, and over half of the rest of Idlib. Their withdrawal was seen as the real test of the accord reached on September 17 between rebel backer Ankara and regime supporter Moscow in the Russian resort town of Sochi. The deal provides for a 15-20 kilometre buffer zone semi-circling opposition-held areas in Idlib and the neighbouring provinces of Latakia, Hama, and Aleppo. It set a first deadline of October 10 for all rebels and jihadists to pull heavy weapons from the zone, a task which Turkey, the Observatory, and rebels said was done on time. But late Saturday, mortar rounds fired from the buffer hit regime positions and killed two soldiers, the Observatory said, indicating heavy arms may still be in the zone. The apparent violation came just ahead of the deal’s second and more consequential deadline: a full jihadist withdrawal of the zone by Monday, paving the way for Russia and Turkey to monitor the area. HTS has yet to take a formal stance on the Sochi accord and its most recent statement made no mention of the deadline. But it and other jihadists appeared to have quietly pulled out their heavy arms in line with the first deadline on October 10. That, observers said, could indicate that hope was not yet lost for the buffer. “Even if the agreement is not fully implemented today, it doesn’t mean that it’s not holding,” said Haid Haid, research fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation. HTS would seek the “best possible scenario” for its own survival, but that may include “a partial withdrawal”. Better late than never? Sam Heller, an International Crisis Group analyst, said the ambiguity in HTS’s statement “could be seen as a sort of implicit acceptance of the Sochi deal and its implementation”. The onus was now on Ankara and Moscow — the deal’s two sponsors and the chief powerbrokers of the Syrian war — to overcome the missed deadline. “October 15 is a test of Turkey’s ability to implement the deal, but at the same time it’s a test of Russia’s intentions and how serious it is about continuing the agreement,” Heller told AFP. It would show whether Moscow was committed to keeping the deal alive or “implementing it to the letter,” he said. Last week, Russia hinted that it could accept a brief delay if it meant the spirit of the deal was still upheld. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the buffer should be fully operational by October 15, but that a delay of one or two days would “make no difference.” Syria’s top diplomat Muallem said earlier this month that the deal may take until December to execute. But he hinted on Monday that the military option was not off the table, saying jihadists should be removed from Idlib. “We have to wait, but at the same time, our troops are still ready around Idlib,” he said. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has said the Idlib is only “temporary,” and that the area would eventually fall back to government hands."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Rebels fire shells from Syria buffer despite heavy arms pullout	"BEIRUT (AFP) - Opposition fighters have fired mortar shells from a planned buffer zone in northwest Syria, in a deadly attack that threatens a deal to protect the last major rebel bastion from a regime offensive. The Russian-Turkish accord also provides for militants to withdraw by Monday (Oct 15) from the demilitarised zone ringing rebel-held areas in and around Idlib province. But a monitor and Agence France-Presse (AFP) correspondent said on Sunday no hardliners had been seen leaving the region yet. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor reported ""heavy mortar shells"" were fired late on Saturday from the planned buffer area into regime territory, killing two soldiers. The deal agreed last month is only the latest in a string of truces throughout Syria's seven-year war, which has killed more than 360,000 people and displaced millions. It calls for setting up a horseshoe-shaped buffer zone around the Idlib region that would be free of heavy arms by Oct 10 and of ""radical fighters"" by Oct 15. Rebels and militants had reportedly met the first deadline, with Turkish officials, armed factions and the Britain-based Observatory reporting that the area was free of heavy-duty weaponry. But the shells which on Saturday hit an army position in Hama province appear to have violated the accord. ""This is the first clear violation of the deal since the heavy weapons were withdrawn. This area is supposed to be clear of heavy weapons, including mortar shells,"" said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. He said intermittent regime shelling had been hitting the planned buffer for days, but the deal does not require government forces to withdraw any of their weapons. Syrian pro-regime daily Al-Watan also reported rebel shelling, saying on Sunday that western parts of Aleppo province were being hit with ""rocket fire and shelling with heavy weapons, which were supposed to be pulled out from the area"". And an AFP correspondent in western Aleppo reported mortar fire in the area after several days of quiet. The Observatory said it was not clear which groups fired the mortars, as both the Turkish-backed National Liberation Front (NLF) and rival militant factions were present in the area. The NLF - which holds just under half of the Idlib region and has welcomed the accord - did not immediately respond to AFP's request for comment on the shelling. The lion's share of Idlib is held by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an alliance led by former Al-Qaeda members, as well as more hardline militants like Hurras al-Deen and Ansar al-Islam. Those fighters also control more than two-thirds of the planned buffer zone and are supposed to withdraw by Monday. But that deadline appeared increasingly precarious on Sunday, with no hardliners visibly leaving the zone as the clock winds down. The Observatory said it had not monitored any withdrawals, and an AFP correspondent in Idlib also said no militant factions had moved any of their units in recent days. Hurras al-Deen has publicly rejected the agreement, although it apparently withdrew its heavy arms from the area last week. HTS, widely considered the most powerful force in Idlib, has not publicly commented on the accord but also quietly abided by its first deadline and re-stationed heavy arms elsewhere. Persuading these factions to implement the deal's second half would be much more challenging, observers say. In a recent report for the Turkey-based Omran Center, expert Nawar Oliver described HTS's approval as the deal's ultimate ""test"". ""If HTS acts as a spoiler to the agreement on the ground, this will probably lead to one of two scenarios: either Turkey and the NLF launch military action against HTS, or Russia will seize the opportunity with the support of the regime and its allies to enter Idlib,"" he said. ""The ramifications of that move could be vast,"" he added. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and other top government officials have warned that the Idlib deal was only a ""temporary"" measure. On Friday, residents around Idlib received warning messages on their mobile phones from the Syrian army. ""Get away from the fighters. Their fate is sealed and near,"" one said."	Terrorism	Terrorism

Report: Residents of Cheras flats unaware Abu Sayyaf leader was their neighbour	" KUALA LUMPUR, July 8 — Residents of Desa Baiduri flats in Cheras had no knowledge that a leader from the Abu Sayyaf group was quietly living among them for two years, up until his arrest in August last year. Hajar Abdul Mubin, also known as Abu Asrie, had apparently been living in Kuala Lumpur with other relatives and friends from the same Yakan ethnic group, mainly found in Basilan, Philippines. In an exclusive Sunday Star report, neighbours testified that they did not think much of the Yakans residing in the flats, including Hajar who is the nephew of another Abu Sayyaf leader called Furuji Indama. Housewife Nurul Shuhada, 26, who lived in the unit opposite Hajar’s, remembered seeing many people regularly going in and out of the flat, adding that she merely thought they were unemployed. “They liked to chat. When I made kerepek (crisps) outside, they liked to talk with me and asked me where my kuih (cakes) were going and things like that. “I was surprised when I heard that those people were with the Abu Sayyaf because they were friendly to their neighbours,” she told the Sunday edition of the English daily. A retired air force man Zulkifli Abu Talib, 57, said the Yakan community in the Desa Baiduri flats tended to stick together. “We just thought they were Sabahan. Their language isn’t Bahasa Malaysia; they spoke their own language among themselves,” he said. Before Hajar’s arrest, Zulkifli’s son had been involved in a scuffle with a group of Yakan, which later turned violent enough to prompt police intervention but it was settled with no report lodged. “Just two weeks later, the police came. Then I found out that they were with the Abu Sayyaf. All of us here were scared. We were shocked,” Zulkifli said On Tuesday, the High Court sentenced Abu Asrie to six years’ jail for supporting the Abu Sayyaf by becoming a member of the group at a house in Lorong Pangsa Baiduri 2, Taman Desa Baiduri in Cheras from 2010 to August 30 last year. Hajar’s brother-in-law Abdul Syamir Dabilin, 25, was also sentenced to three years for intentionally omitting information on a terrorist act at the same time and place. Meanwhile, Hajar’s sister, who wished to be known as Rosmawati, told Sunday Star that her brother wanted to turn over a new leaf and build a new life for himself in Kuala Lumpur. “If you leave the Abu Sayyaf group, they will kill you,” she said. “So he made the choice. If he stayed in the Philippines and they found him, they would kill him. So he escaped here.” According to the 22-year-old, Hajar was married two years ago and now has a five-month-old daughter. She added Hajar was a quiet man who rarely went out with friends and preferred to stay at home, reading the Quran and praying. During his time with the Abu Sayyaf in Basilan, Hajar is believed to have been involved in the kidnapping of six Philippine nationals and may have even taken part in beheading one of them."

2 more Abu Sayyaf surrender in Basilan	"ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines — Two more members of the Abu Sayyaf surrendered to the government Sunday in a remote village of Basilan after learning how their former comrades are being reintegrated into society, authorities said Monday. Superintendent Rufino Inot, Basilan police director, said Abu Sayyaf members Jamad Habil Habing, 22, and his younger brother Jem, 20, also surrendered their weapon, including an M16 rifle with an M203 grenade launcher, four magazines loaded with ammunition, four rounds of M203 ammunition and a bandolier. Inot said the Habing siblings, who were followers of notorious Abu Sayyaf leader Furuji Indama, surrendered to the Basilan police Sunday at Barangay Baguindan, Tipo-Tipo town. The police said the two Abu Sayyaf members told them they no longer believe their leaders' warnings that the authorities would kill them if they surrender. The two surrenderees also reportedly told police that they had heard about how the lives of other Abu Sayyaf who surrendered earlier had already improved. Habing said other Abu Sayyaf are considering surrendering because they are tired from hiding and starving in the mountains. The surrender of the Habings brings to 180 the number of Abu Sayyaf group members — including Nurhassan Jamiri, a senior leader — who have surrendered to the government. Police and military estimated about less than 40 Abu Sayyaf members are still hiding with Indama in the Sampinit, a mountain complex in the center of Basilan Island. Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao Regional Governor Mujiv Hataman said positive developments continue for Abu Sayyaf members who surrendered ahead. ""Some of those are just trying to find the timing to escape from the tyranny of their leaders, because they see that the improvements in the lives of those who surrendered ahead of them,"" he said. He said the Basilan provincial government and security forces are helping implement assistance and livelihood training, as well as community integration, for the surrenderees. ""These efforts really enticed more Abu Sayyaf members to stream down into the community,"" Hataman said. He said the efforts are part of the Program Against Violent Extremism to assist those who were misled into terrorism or who were forced to join the Abu Sayyaf group. "	Terrorism	Terrorism

Senior Abu Sayyaf member arrested in Jolo for kidnapping	"COTABATO CITY, Philippines — Agents arrested on Saturday night in Jolo, Sulu a senior member of the Islamic State-inspired Abu Sayyaf wanted for kidnapping and other heinous offenses. Chief Superintendent Graciano Mijares of the Police Regional Office-Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao said Sunday Hashim Abtain, most known in Sulu province as Abu Imam, is now detained, awaiting prosecution. Mijares said police units in Sulu were assisted by the Police Regional Office-9 in Zamboanga City in the operation that led to Abtain's arrest. Abtain reportedly enjoyed the protection of certain powerful politicians in Sulu, enabling him to move around in the island province freely. Sulu, a component area of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, is said to be the most dangerous province in the country and a bastion of the Abu Sayyaf. ""God-fearing vigilant people in the local communities helped the police locate him in Jolo on Saturday night,"" Mijares said. Abtain did not resist arrest when personnel of the Sulu provincial police and PRO-9, backed by soldiers, cornered and immediately cuffed him while inside a house along Serrantes Street in Jolo, capital town of Sulu.

Abu Sayyaf bombs DPWH officials’ residences in Basilan	"Isabela City – Suspected members of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) detonated an Improvise Explosive Device (IED) outside the residence of the district engineer of the Department of Public Works and Highways-Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (DPWH-ARMM) in Basilan late Thursday night. Another IED  was recovered by  police and military authorities outside  the perimeter fence of DPWH-ARMM Basilan assistant district engineer. Police  and military authorities here said the explosion occurred at around 9:50 p.m. Thursday  at the perimeter fence of DPWH-ARMM District Engineer  Soler Undug’s house located at Calle Bisaya in this city, while the Undug family was  preparing to go to bed. The authorities here said another  IED, which failed to explode, was  also found by the police and military authorities outside the residence  of DPWH-ARMM Basilan assistant  district engineer Salonga ‘Bong’ Lasatan,  located in the village of Aguada, which is just a few meters away from the residence of  Undug. No one was hurt because of the twin explosions, but these caused mild panic among residents in the area. “(The police and military) know these people who are involved in extortion  and insurgency activities here. But still they cannot arrest them with the implementation of martial law in Mindanao,”  some residents living near the blast site said. A  government official in this province, who declined to be named, challenge police and military authorities here to go after these rogue elements. The police said a cellular phone was used as triggering device for the IEDs. Undug said footage from a close circuit television (CCTV) camera installed outside his residence showed four persons planting the IED. He said that a copy of the footage is now with the police and military. Undug said he has been receiving extortion text messages from the ASG, threatening him and his family with harm if they do not give in to their demand for protection money. Alarmed local residents said the police and military authorities should strengthen their security and intelligence network in order to avoid a similar incident from happening again.

Police arrest eight terror suspects	" KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 16 — The police have arrested seven Filipinos and a Malaysian suspected to be involved in terrorism, including a Filipino who has beheaded captives of the Abu Sayyaf Group, it was disclosed today. Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi Harun said the suspects were arrested in raids conducted between October 30 and November 12 in Sabah and Putrajaya by the Special Branch Counter Terrorism Division. The Malaysian was the first to be arrested, in Putrajaya on October 30, he said in a statement, adding that the 38-year-old man had been an agent selling gold bullion. “The suspect was involved in channelling funds to Akel Zainal (a Malaysian who had joined the Daesh terrorists in Syria) in 2017 to finance terrorist activities,” he said. The second raid, on November 1 in Tenom, Sabah, resulted in the arrest of three Filipino suspects aged 27, 34 and 51 who worked as labourers, he said. “They are members of the Abu Sayyaf Group involved in kidnapping for ransom in the southern Philippines and Sabah,” Mohamad Fuzi said, adding that the 34-year-old suspect had the skills to produce firearms for the group’s use. On November 8, two more Filipinos, aged 35 and 46, were arrested in Ranau, Sabah, he said. One was a labourer and the other a technician. “The 35-year-old suspect had recruited children into the Abu Sayyaf Group and used them as human shields during the battles with the Philippine military in Basilan, southern Philippines. “He was also involved in beheading captives of the group. The two were caught before their planned escape to the southern Philippines to evade arrest by the Malaysian authorities,” he said. Mohamad Fuzi said the fourth raid, on November 10 in Kinarut, Sabah, resulted in the arrest of a 30-year-old Filipino blacksmith who is an Abu Sayyaf Group commander and right-hand man of Furuji Indama, a senior leader of the group."

"Abu Sayyaf terror group regrouping, looking to get back into business of kidnap-for-ransom"	"KOTA KINABALU (THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - The resurrection of a kidnap-for-ransom group in the southern Philippines after a 21-month hiatus is posing fresh threats to Sabah's east coast. Abu Sayyaf sub-commanders are regrouping after nearly two years on the run. One ""resurrected"" sub-commander is Indang Susukan, who was widely reported to have died when his wife and children were killed during a security forces' attack on his home base in Talipao, on Jolo island. He previously held several hostages who were abducted from the east coast of Sabah, including the Tung cousins from Negri Sembilan kidnapped in 2012, Taiwanese Chang An Wei (snatched from Pom Pom island in 2013) and Bernard Then, the first and only Malaysian to be beheaded by Abu Sayyaf. Indang is back on the radar of Philippine security forces as he is believed to be plotting a cross-border kidnapping. The sub-commander has recovered from gunshot injuries during the security forces' attack and kept a low profile. He has changed his looks by dyeing his long black hair blonde. He, however, continues to organise localised kidnappings in Jolo town with the Lucky 9 group. Indang, according to a regional intelligence source, is working with another Abu Sayyaf sub-commander, Hatib Sawadjan, who managed to stay out of sight during the crackdown on the Abu Sayyaf. The source said Indang and Hatib received financing from southern Philippine political warlords growing edgy over the newly introduced Bangsamoro Organic Law (also known as Bangsamoro Basic Law). The BOL creates a Muslim-majority sub-state in the Philippines that will replace the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao. The source explained that the warlords were setting their sights on ""high value"" victims. According to the source, the warlords - through Abu Sayyaf sub-commanders - have so far financed up to 1.7 million pesos (S$122,868.48) for two kidnap-for-ransom groups to carry out kidnappings in waters off the east coast of Sabah. The source said one of the groups, with at least eight gunmen led by Amah Ullah, aka Suraka, tried to target an oil palm-laden tugboat in Tambisan waters off Lahad Datu on Aug 10. But the group failed after Malaysian forces sped to the scene when they were alerted by the crew, who hid in the tugboat. The source said Suraka was backed by another group of seven under Salip Murah, who was waiting at the sea border. After the failed attempt, Philippine authorities tracked down Suraka to the Tawi-Tawi chain of islands in the southern Philippines and killed him a few days later, while several members of his eight-man gang were caught, the source added. Subsequently, Salip and his group fled towards the Philippines' Palawan island (north of Kudat), where they picked up two Filipino hostages and returned to Jolo. The source said Indang paid two other groups one million pesos to seek high-value targets in Sabah waters. On Sept 11, a group led by an Abu Sayyaf gunman named Titing used pump boats to sneak from Siluag island in the southern Philippines into Sabah waters by navigating through shallow shoals. Pump boats, often likened to sea scooters, are powered by water pumps and used as a cheaper mode of transport to move around shallow waters without any hassle, rather than using outboard engines. The source said for kidnap-for-ransom groups, travelling on a pump boat was much cheaper as it cost them about RM200 in fuel for a round trip from Jolo to Semporna. With speedboat engines, the fuel could cost over RM1,000. ""These pump boats are very agile, they can move through shallow waters and also seaweed farms without getting stuck like those with outboard engines,"" he said. In the latest case, the abductors snatched two Indonesian fishermen at gunpoint from a trawler anchored near Pulau Gaya, which is about a 30- to 40-minute boat ride from Semporna town. Mr Samsul Sagunim, 40, and Mr Usman Yunus, 35, were taken on a pump boat to Jolo, where they are said to be held by Indang in Patikul. ""The kidnappers thought that the hostages were Malaysians as the fishing trawler flew the Malaysian flag,"" said the source, adding that a Malaysian hostage could be worth a ransom of about RM1 million (S$329,893.87), whereas it was only about RM50,000 for an Indonesian boatman. Sabah Police Commissioner Datuk Omar Mammah told reporters on Tuesday that the captors were demanding RM4 million for the release of the fishermen. ""That's not surprising, because usually the initial ransom demand is outrageous as it is part of such groups' bargaining process,"" said the source. Before this, the last abduction in Sabah waters was on Dec 8, 2016, when the notorious Abraham @ Ibrahim went on a kidnapping spree. In his third bid that night, Abraham and two accomplices were killed by police in a gunfight off Pulau Gaya, in Semporna. Police rescued a victim, but two other kidnappers and a second victim are still missing at sea. According to the source, the second kidnap-for-ransom group, led by one self-styled ""Commander Black"", is lurking in the waters between eastern Sabah and the Tawi-Tawi chain of islands. ""Commander Black is an emerging kidnapper. He is aggressive and he will take on security forces if confronted,"" he said. The source said they were using ""spotters"" to give them information on potential targets. ""The Sept 11 kidnapping was a test run. It was successful and the kidnap-for-ransom group will use the same route - going through shallow waters - to go for a more audacious attempt along the shores of Semporna town,"" he said. However, Commander Black's plan might have hit a snag. Last Thursday night, in the waters off Kunak, Eastern Sabah Security Command (Esscom) shot dead two suspected kidnap-for-ransom group ""collaborators"" and recovered two revolvers, a samurai sword and a pump boat which were suspected to be used in the kidnapping of the two Indonesians. Esscom commander Deputy Comm Datuk Hazani Ghazali said they believed the two killed were key local links to the groups involved in the Sept 11 snatching of the two Indonesians off Pulau Gaya. ""I believe we have cut off their links, hopefully they will not have spotters to guide them into our waters,"" he said when contacted."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Sayyaf kills five soldiers, hurts 23"	"Militants have killed five soldiers and wounded 23 others in a major ambush by members of a notorious Islamist kidnap-for-ransom group, military authorities said Saturday. The soldiers were searching for hostages taken by the Abu Sayyaf group when the gunmen attacked them in Jolo on Friday, regional military spokesman Lt. Col. Gerry Besana told reporters. Meanwhile, the Abu Sayyaf Group bandits have released a woman they kidnapped together with her husband almost two months ago in Zamboanga del Norte, police said Saturday.  In a statement, the Sulu Provincial Police Office said the victim, Helen Roda, was released around 2:30 p.m. Thursday in Barangay Anuling, Patikul, Sulu.  ASG sub-leaders Mujer Yadah and Injam Yadah released Roda following the alleged payment of a P1-million ransom, police said.  The ransom was reportedly delivered by two unidentified negotiators who, at the same time, accompanied Roda in her travel to Zamboanga City aboard a commercial ferry, police said.  Roda was released 29 days after the ASG bandits freed her husband, Rufo, a militiaman, on Oct. 18 following the alleged payment of P1.2 million in ransom.  They were seized on Aug. 31 by five ASG bandits following a firefight in Barangay Piacan, a coastal village in the town of Sirawai, Zamboanga del Norte.  Six people, including a militiaman, were killed while a child was wounded in the clash that broke out when the militiamen responded to the reported arrival of five gunmen clad in camouflage uniforms.  Roda’s release has brought down to six the number of hostages still in the hands of the ASG bandits. The hostages include a Dutch, a Vietnamese, and four Filipinos.  According to Besana, “The effort is part of our mission to rescue the remaining hostages.”  The Abu Sayyaf is a loose alliance of several hundred armed militants formed in the 1990s with seed money from Osama bin Laden’s Al-Qaeda network.Friday’s clash was one of the deadliest since an Abu Sayyaf faction joined other foreign and Filipino militants in seizing the southern Philippine city of Marawi last year, leading to a five-month battle that claimed more than 1,100 lives. The Abu Sayyaf is now believed to hold “less than 10” hostages, Besana said. The group is based in Mindanao but its members began in 2016 to kidnap sailors in the waters between Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The militants have also raided and taken hostages from resorts in the Mindanao and neighboring Malaysia. Most of the hostages have been ransomed off for huge amounts of money and several were beheaded, including two Canadian tourists in 2016.  A Dutch birdwatcher abducted on a nearby island in 2012 is believed to be among those still in Abu Sayyaf’s hands. The Dutchman’s Swiss colleague escaped in 2014 after grabbing a kidnapper’s machete and killing him. The soldiers who survived Friday’s ambush did not see any hostages during the 90-minute clash near the town of Patikul, Besana said. Besana added the soldiers from the Army’s 41st Infantry Battalion were on a combat patrol when they encountered the ASG bandits under Almuder Yadah and Sub-leader Hatib Hajan Sawadjaan, identified as two notorious ASG leaders. He said the fighting erupted in different stages, the first lasting for an hour. After a couple of minutes of a lull, gunfire rang anew, sparking a 30-minute battle."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Two Indonesian fishermen kidnapped off Semporna	"KOTA KINABALU, Sept 11 — Kidnappers here have struck again in Sabah’s east coast, this time abducting two Indonesian fishermen in Semporna’s Pulau Gaya early this morning. Sabah acting police chief Datuk Omar Mammah said three fishermen had just docked on Pulau Gaya at about 1am when they were approached by a pump boat and had their power cut off. “One of the men on the boat immediately hid in a compartment on the front of the boat but managed to see two men in masks and armed with M16s climb onboard and then heard them speak in Suluk,” he said to reporters this morning. The witness eventually came out from hiding about an hour later and his 40-year-old skipper and 35-year-old assistant were nowhere to be found. He later made a police report about his missing co-workers. ""We have taken a statement from the witness and are investigating the incident now,"" said Omar, adding that they were also checking to see whether the suspects belong to the Abu Sayyaf group. Sabah chief minister Datuk Seri Mohd Shafie Apdal said that he was informed of the incident and said the authorities will assist their Indonesian counterparts as best as they can. “I believe they have identified the fishermen who were kidnapped now. We will upgrade our surveillance and intelligence and find out where they are the best we can. “Even though they are not Malaysians, they were caught in our boundary so we must protect them,” he said. Sabah's 6pm to 6am sea curfew, first imposed four years ago, was extended to Sept 13 and covers areas up to three nautical miles off Tawau, Semporna, Kunak, Lahad Datu, Kinabatangan, Sandakan and Beluran. Sabah’s east coast used to be a major target for kidnap-for-ransom groups, who found it lucrative to abduct tourists from the many islands. Tourism took a dive from 2013 onwards following a spate of tourist kidnappings, but incidences have reduced following the introduction of a curfew from 6pm to 6am four years ago. Since then, the kidnappers have set their sights on fishing trawlers, usually at the borders of international waters."	Terrorism	Terrorism

"Jolo inmates unlock jail cell, 29 escape"	"JOLO, Philippines — Police said Sunday they were hunting for 12 of 29 inmates who escaped from a jail on Jolo island that is the stronghold of Islamist militants. The detainees bolted from a prison inside a police station in war-torn Jolo on Saturday where they were being held mostly on drugs charges. The remaining 17 were recaptured the same day, police said. Jolo is a base for the Abu Sayyaf kidnap-for-ransom group and authorities said they were investigating whether or not the inmates who escaped had links with the militants. “A guard went on break, went to the toilet and when he left, the inmates found a way to escape. They picked the lock of the jail cell and fled,” regional police spokesman Senior Inspector Jemar delos Santos told AFP. “We are heightening security around the perimeter of the island municipality and securing ports so that they would not be able to leave Jolo.” The jail had a capacity of about 50 inmates and was located near a port, Delos Santos added. Police replaced all the prison guards as they probed the jailbreak. The Philippines frequently has mass escapes from prisons, which are usually overcrowded, poorly maintained and inadequately guarded. In the country’s biggest jailbreak, more than 150 inmates escaped a prison in the southern Philippines in January last year after about a hundred gunmen stormed the facility. In July 2017, three inmates were killed and another was wounded as 14 prisoners escaped from a jail in Jolo. Islamist militants in the mainly Catholic nation including Abu Sayyaf members pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group as they went on a rampage in the southern city of Marawi. The five-month siege flattened Marawi, claimed more than 1,100 lives and sparked fears IS was seeking to establish a regional base."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Three Indonesian hostages freed in Philippines: Army	"JOLO, Philippines (AFP) - Three Indonesian fishermen held by members of a notorious Islamist kidnap-for-ransom group have walked free 18 months after they were abducted off the southern Philippines, the military said on Sunday (Sept 16). The men were kidnapped in January 2017 while on board a speedboat off the southernmost island group of Tawi-Tawi which, together with the nearby Sulu archipelago, is preyed on by Abu Sayyaf militants. The Indonesians were freed in the town of Indanan in Sulu on Saturday and turned over to the authorities following ""intensified military operations"" against the Abu Sayyaf, a regional army spokesman said without giving details. Asked if a ransom was paid, Lieutenant-Colonel Gerry Besana told Agence France-Presse: ""No, there was definitely no ransom given. (They) were pressured by our operations."" The Abu Sayyaf has been known to behead hostages unless ransom payments are made. The group is a loose network of militants formed in the 1990s with seed money from Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda network. It has earned millions of dollars from banditry and kidnappings-for-ransom, often targeting foreigners. The Abu Sayyaf is based in strife-torn southern islands but its members began in 2016 to kidnap sailors in the waters between Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. The rise in abductions sparked Indonesian warnings that the region could become the ""next Somalia"" and pushed the three neighbours to pledge joint naval patrols. On Sunday, the Philippine military identified the three Indonesians as Hamdam Bin Salim, 34, Subande Satto, 27, and Sudarlan Samansung, 41. The hostages were brought to a military hospital and turned over to the Indonesian ambassador, who was to accompany them to the Philippine capital Manila, a military statement said. The Abu Sayyaf is still holding 11 hostages, including a Dutch bird-watcher abducted in 2012 and a Vietnamese captive, according to Lt-Col Besana."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Malaysia police hunt for four ISIS militants still on the run	"Malaysia's police chief Mohamad Fuzi Harun said in a statement on Monday (April 16) that six members of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) cell were arrested between Feb 27 and March 1. But four others were still on the run. Police said the men were ""dangerous"" and ""capable of launching attacks that could pose a threat to national security"". Clockwise from top left: The suspects listed were named as Muhamad Faizal Muhamad Hanafi, Muhamad Hanafi Yah, both of whom are from Kelantan state, Awae Wae-Eya, a Thai national living in southern Thailand and Nor Farkhan Mohd Isa, whose address was given as being in southern Johor. (Courtesy of Royal Malaysian Police/-) Two of the suspects listed were named as Muhamad Faizal Muhamad Hanafi and Muhamad Hanafi Yah, both from Kelantan state. A third suspect is Nor Farkhan Mohd Isa, whose address was given as being in Taman Ungku Tun Aminah in Skudai, southern Johor. The fourth suspect is Awae Wae-Eya, a Thai national living in Narathiwat province in southern Thailand. ""We have been monitoring the cells for the last few months. We are asking the public to share with us if they have any information on the whereabouts of these four suspects. They should approach the police if they know anything,"" Bukit Aman Special Branch's Counter Terrorism chief Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay told The Straits Times. Intelligence sources say they believe Awae is the group's mastermind, based on interrogation of the six men arrested, and that he is trying to establish an ISIS cell in southern Thailand. The arrests of the other members of the terror cell, which included two men working as janitors in Singapore, were previously announced on March 24. The plot was uncovered after Malaysian counter-terrorism police, aided by their Singaporean counterparts, detained the terrorists in a series of swoops. The order to kidnap and kill policemen was the first of its kind, according to an intelligence source. The six men who were nabbed earlier included a 37-year-old technician who was initially thought to have masterminded the plans to attack places of worship in Johor Baru. The second suspect, a 49-year-old security guard, was the cell's adviser and responsible for keeping the cell and its plans secret. Also picked up during the raids was a 30-year-old security guard, who was tasked with acquiring firearms from a neighbouring country and scouting for non-Muslim houses of worship to target. Another suspect, a 25-year-old waiter, had been ordered to kidnap and kill policemen. Two others, aged 23 and 22, were arrested on March 1 and worked as janitors in Singapore. One of them acted as the intermediary in the purchase of firearms for the cell, while the other was picked up to facilitate police investigations. A member of the Abu Sayyaf group in the Philippines was also arrested during the police crackdown, in Sabah, on March 15. The 31-year-old man is said to be a trusted lieutenant to Furuji Indama, the group's leader based in Basilan. Believed to have connections to Malaysian militant Mahmud Ahmad, he is also wanted by Philippines authorities for involvement in a kidnap-for-ransom syndicate. He is an expert in making improvised explosive devices and had planned to attack several locations in Sabah. Malaysia has arrested nearly 400 people since 2013 for suspected links to terrorism. The Muslim-majority nation faces threats from self-radicalised ISIS sympathisers at home, and regional militant groups which seek funding and refuge in South-east Asia. Malaysia's only terrorist attack took place in June 2016, when two men on a motorcycle lobbed a grenade into a nightclub in Selangor, injuring eight people. The men were sentenced to 25 years' jail each."	Terrorism	Terrorism

Malaysia holds Filipinos seeking to set up extremist cell 	"Ten suspected Islamic militants who were trying to establish a Malaysian cell of a Philippine kidnap-for-ransom group have been arrested in Borneo island, police said Wednesday. The alleged extremists, mostly Filipinos, are also accused of trying to help fighters linked to the Islamic State (IS) group travel to the country to join up with militants here, they said. Mindanao has long been a pocket of Islamic militancy in the largely Catholic country. A long siege in Marawi, the country’s main Muslim center, sparked fears IS was seeking to establish a foothold in the region. Malaysian police made the arrests in January and early February in Sabah state on the Malaysian part of Borneo, not far from the southern Philippines. Borneo is a vast island shared between Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei. Seven of those detained were Filipinos, including several senior members of the extremist group Abu Sayyaf which has been behind the kidnappings of numerous foreigners, Malaysian national police chief Mohamad Fuzi Harun said in a statement. “Early information obtained from the 10 suspects caught in Sabah revealed an attempt by the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group to set up a cell in Sabah,” he said. One of those arrested was a 39-year-old believed to have received orders from a senior militant leader in the southern Philippines to bring IS members from the city of Sandakan in Sabah to join militant groups. Another suspect was a 27-year-old identified as a senior member of the Abu Sayyaf Group. The other three detained were Malaysians, police said. Officials did not disclose the suspects’ identities. Malaysia has rounded up numerous suspected militants in recent times as fears grow that the influence of the IS group could encourage extremists to launch attacks in the Muslim-majority country. Abu Sayyaf, originally a loose network of militants formed in the 1990s with seed money from Osama bin Laden’s Al-Qaeda network, has splintered into factions, with some continuing to engage in banditry and kidnappings. One faction pledged allegiance to IS and joined militants in the siege of Marawi, which claimed more than 1,100 lives."	Terrorism	Terrorism
6 Scout Rangers wounded in clash with Abu Sayyaf in Sulu	" ZAMBOANGA CITY – A fierce clash between security forces and Abu Sayyaf bandits in Patikul, Sulu on Tuesday resulted in the wounding of six Scout Rangers, the military reported Wednesday. Brig. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, commander of Joint Task Force Sulu, said at least five bandits were reportedly killed based on information from ground sources. Sobejana said soldiers were conducting a “focused” military operation early morning Tuesday when they clashed with an Abu Sayyaf group under Radulan Sahiron in Barangay Panglahayan. The firefight lasted until about noontime, he said. Two of the wounded soldiers had to be airlifted here and taken to a private hospital. Four others remained at the Kuta Teodolfo Bautista Trauma Hospital in Jolo, according to Sobejana. Lt. Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr., the commander of the Western Mindanao Command, described the positions of the clashing forces as very close at about 20 meters. “That is why they [Scout Rangers] were able to fire at the enemy at close range. They were just very careful due to the possible presence of kidnap victims with the Abu Sayyaf,” Galvez said. He said the military pounded the retreating bandits with howitzers and mortars. Galvez said in the aftermath of the clash, the pursuing soldiers recovered two M16 rifles. “The Joint Task Force Sulu continues to employ more pressure on the remaining Abu Sayyaf bandits to rescue captives and gain more enemy strongholds and armaments,” Sobejana said."

ESSCom heightens security following kidnap threats	"LAHAD DATU, Oct 31 — The Eastern Sabah Security Command (ESSCom) has heightened security and mobilised all its assets at sea as well as control posts following threats by the Abu Sayyaf Group of conducting kidnapping activities in the region. ESSCom commander DCP Datuk Hazani Ghazali in a statement today urged the community in the Eastern Sabah Security Zone (ESSZone) to inform ESSCom of any suspicious activities via its hotline at 089-863181 for immediate action. Yesterday, online portal Marine Link posted a statement from a source in the Philippine Coast Guard, saying that a group of about 10 Abu Sayyaf members armed with pistols, rifles and grenade launchers was planning to conduct kidnapping activities at any opportune time in undisclosed areas in Sabah, primarily targeting businessmen or crew of foreign vessels passing through the area. They are using unmarked blue and white coloured ‘motor bancas’ (Philippine boats). Ship masters and crew are strongly urged to exercise extra vigilance when transiting the waters off Eastern Sabah (Malaysia) as well as the seas of Sulu and Celebes."	Terrorism	Terrorism
 A new deadline to wipe out Abu Sayyaf 	" AT the start of 2017, President Duterte,  then  just a few months in office, gave the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) six months to neutralize the Abu Sayyaf. The  notorious  group had just kidnapped a German yacht owner after killing his wife in the waters around Sulu and was now demanding ransom. Earlier in 2015, the Abu Sayyaf had kidnapped three foreigners and a Filipina in the Davao Gulf, then killed two of the foreigners, both Canadians. It was then said to be holding about 20  other hostages of various nationalities, all for ransom. The deadline for the presidential order was June 30, 2017, but the AFP drive was overtaken by the  siege of Marawi on May 23. On that day, forces of the Maute Group, supported by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS),  seized the city center in a war that was to rage in the next five months as the whole of Mindanao was placed under martial law. Early this  month , the Abu Sayyaf  was again in the news. After kidnapping two policewomen in Patikul, Sulu,  on April 29, the outlaw group reportedly released them in Talipao, Sulu.  Their relatives paid R2.5 million for their release, down from  an original demand of R5 million,  according to one source, after negotiation by a leader of the Moro National Liberation Front. Government forces in Sulu have now been given a new deadline to wipe out the Abu Sayyaf – December this year,  seven months from now. Brig. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, commander of Joint Task Force Sulu, said  the  deadline was issued by the new Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) chief-of-staff Gen. Carlito Galvez at  a command conference  in Zamboanga City last Wednesday. Ten Army battalions have been deployed in Sulu  and  an additional battalion is coming from Marawi. These forces, together with units of the Philippine National Police (PNP), now led by its new chief, Director General Oscar Albayalde,   will mount the new campaign to wipe  out  the Abu Sayyaf. Mindanao has long been a problem area for the government, with two major groups – the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) – having mass support. The Duterte administration is well on  the  way to ending  age-old problems with  them with the proposed Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. There are, however, many smaller outlaw groups which have been thriving in Mindanao. The Abu Sayyaf is perhaps the most notorious of them, with  kidnapping for ransom  as its forte. The initial effort of the Duterte administration to eliminate the Abu Sayyaf in 2017 was thwarted by the Marawi rebellion of the Maute Group. But now, with that operation over and with the new chiefs of  the AFP and the PNP, government forces should be able to put an end to this group which has gained international notoriety  because of its foreign kidnap victims, and carry  out at long last President Duterte’s  order to wipe it out."

Former Abu Sayyaf sniper aims to regain lost childhood	"ISABELA CITY — Ten-year-old “Tony” has recently gone back to school, in a madrassa where he can continue learning Arabic—and be a child again. Only four years ago, Tony did not even have the opportunity to play, let alone attend classes. Instead, he lugged around an M4 assault rifle and was attacking and evading government troops as a member of the Abu Sayyaf terrorist group. The boy proved to be no ordinary fighter and was deemed one of the sharpest among the 30 young combatants under the command of Motong Indama, a  younger cousin of Abu Sayyaf leader Furudji Indama. “The training took about a year,” recalled Tony.  “I was taught how to handle a gun. The [Abu Sayyaf members] were so happy with me that they called me the Tipo-Tipo sniper,” he added. Tipo-Tipo was the Basilan town that his group had tried to overrun in 2016, setting off clashes with government soldiers that dragged on for three months. Though Tony had suffered his first combat wounds in a skirmish even before those encounters, he emerged more gung-ho and unafraid of death. When Motong surrendered in July 2016, Tony was one of the 11 among his men who followed. The boy now lives with his uncles under the close supervision of Sumisip town officials. In an interview with the Inquirer last week, Tony said his mother died after being “shot by a soldier” while she was bathing in a river.  His father and three elder siblings were later killed in “another military operation.” He learned about their violent deaths from his two remaining siblings, who were then only in their late teens. The orphan was only 6 when his brothers took him along to join the Abu Sayyaf, then led by Motong and  subleader Radsmil Jannatul. In the jungle, Tony learned how to fire a gun faster than he learned how to read. Soon he was earning notice as a marksman, a scrawny one at that, who could negotiate steep mountain paths and climb tall trees with ease to spot enemies from afar. Death had always stalked him—if not by bullets, then by starvation. “The best part of my life back then was having vegetables and dried fish for a meal; it was considered that special,” he recalled. Despite the Abu Sayyaf’s notoriety as kidnappers who demanded millions of pesos in ransom, the boy said that as far as he knew, Motong’s men were only “tasked to fight” and did not take hostages during his time with the group. In hindsight, he said, the adrenaline rush he felt when the fighting began had made him numb to all the hardships he faced, more so after he got wounded. When word got around that Motong was turning himself in, one of Tony’s siblings who had dragged him into the group thought that his kid brother had had enough. “Now I just want to study in the Islamic school,” the boy said. Tony was one of the 179 Abu Sayyaf surrenderers from Basilan and Sulu whom the regional government of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) hopes to assist in their return to normal life through an initiative called Program Against Violent Extremism (PAVE). Under the program launched earlier this month, surrenderers are provided medical services, housing, livelihood training and alternative learning sessions. But the idea found some resistance among those who had fallen victim to the Abu Sayyaf, acknowledged ARMM Gov. Mujiv Hataman. “I know many people were hurt by this move, especially the kidnap victims.  And while we have not talked about this yet, we are reaching out.  The healing is not complete if the victims are not with us on this. There is no total peace, no total justice, if the former victims are not willing [to join us in this idea],” Hataman added. The governor assured critics that the selected PAVE beneficiaries were “those without [criminal] cases.” “Instead of teaching them to farm, which is [something they have to do] near the mountains, we agreed to teach them how to market their goods, [as well as the] technology for making ginger tea, peanut butter, etc.,” Hataman said, explaining how the program had been designed with the beneficiaries’ situation in mind. The military is supporting the effort. “I have read hundreds of books on terrorism, all foreign models. We are confronted with a homegrown terror group [so] only a homegrown solution is applicable here,” said Brig. Gen. Juvymax Uy, commander of Task Force Basilan. In Tony’s case, that solution may be to give him time to heal his inner wounds from living in the jungle, and again become just another child."	Terrorism	Terrorism

France supermarket attacker was not deemed extremist threat: Interior Minister	"TREBES, France: The man who killed three people in a shooting spree and hostage siege in southern France on Friday was known to police but was not considered a terror threat, Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said. Collomb named the gunman, who was killed by police, as 26-year-old Redouane Lakdim and described him as a small-time drug dealer. ""He was known by the police for petty crimes, we had monitored him and did not think he had been radicalised,"" Collomb said after arriving at the scene of the hostage-taking in the town of Trebes, near Carcassonne. ""He was already under surveillance when he suddenly decided to act,"" he said. Security sources had said the gunman was believed to be a Moroccan who was on a watch list of suspected Islamic extremists, but Collomb did not confirm his nationality. Witnesses said Lakdim shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest) at a supermarket in Trebes, where he took several people hostage after opening fire on passengers in a car and a police officer in nearby Carcassonne. He eventually let the hostages go after a policeman offered to take their place. Security forces stormed the store after he shot the officer who was seriously wounded, Collomb said."

 Iran embassy in Ankara receives ‘suicide bomb threat’	"ANKARA, Oct 16 — An individual who claimed to have links to the Islamic State extremist group threatened to attack the Iranian embassy in Ankara, Tehran’s envoy in Turkey said yesterday, denying Turkish media reports that he had been evacuated. “The suicide attack against the embassy was only a threat,” Ambassador Mohammad Ebrahim Taherian Fard said. “Nothing significant has happened and things are under control.” “The threat was made by someone who introduced himself as linked to Daesh,” Fard said, quoted by state news agency IRNA and referring to IS by its Arabic acronym. Turkish media said Fard had been evacuated but the ambassador and Tehran flatly denied the report as a complete fabrication. “Such a claim is a sheer lie, and the personnel at our embassy are present at their workplace in full health and security,” the foreign ministry said in a statement on its website. Earlier yesterday, DHA news agency said Iran’s mission in the Turkish capital had been given an intelligence warning about a possible suicide bomb attack. The road by the embassy was shut off and police could be seen searching cars in the area, an AFP photographer said earlier yesterday. Ambassador Fard also said Turkish police “intensified security measures” around Tehran’s mission in Ankara in response to the threat. In 2015 and 2016, Turkey was hit by a series of terror attacks which were blamed on both Kurdish militants and the Islamic State jihadist group. The last attack blamed on IS was in January 2017 when a gunman killed 39 people at an elite Istanbul nightclub during New Year celebrations. Since then, Turkish police have conducted regular raids across the country against suspected IS jihadists. They have also regularly targeted members of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which is blacklisted as a terrorist organisation by Ankara and its Western allies. "	Terrorism	Terrorism
Russia poses bigger threat to UK than terror groups: Army chief	" Russia ""indisputably"" now poses a bigger threat to Britain's security than terrorist groups like Islamic State (IS) and Al-Qaeda, the head of the British army said in an interview published Saturday. General Mark Carleton-Smith warned Moscow had shown a willingness to use its military to pursue its national interests while seeking to ""exploit Western vulnerabilities"". ""Russia today indisputably represents a far greater threat to our national security than Islamic extremist threats such as Al-Qaeda and (IS),"" he told The Daily Telegraph. ""Russia has embarked on a systematic effort to explore and exploit Western vulnerabilities, particularly in some of the non-traditional areas of cyber, space, undersea warfare."" Relations between Russia and Britain have sunk to historic lows this year. London has blamed the country's military intelligence service for orchestrating the poisoning with a nerve agent of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury in March. The incident prompted a wave of tit-for-tat diplomatic expulsions between Moscow and the West, as well as a ratcheting up of US sanctions. Carleton-Smith, 54, said following IS battlefield loses in Syria and Iraq, the Western alliance must switch focus to the threat posed by Russia -- and do so through NATO. ""The physical manifestation of the Islamist threat has diminished with the complete destruction of the geography of the so-called Caliphate,"" he said. ""We cannot be complacent about the threat Russia poses or leave it uncontested. ""The most important conventional military response to Russia is the continued capabilities and coherence of the NATO alliance."" The former special forces commander was speaking in his first interview since becoming Britain's chief of the general staff in June. He made the comments after visiting British troops deployed in Estonia as part of a NATO battle group intended to deter aggression from neighbouring Russia. Carleton-Smith also took the opportunity to downplay the need for a separate European army, as recently encouraged by French President Emmanuel Macron. ""I would not support any initiative that diluted the military effectiveness of NATO,"" he said. ""It has been an extraordinarily successful alliance and, in my experience, we should reinforce success."""	Terrorism	Terrorism
 Violent extremism a threat without Bangsamoro Law: Esperon	" Violent extremism may ensue if Congress fails to pass the proposed Bangsamoro Basic Law, National Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon said Tuesday. Extremism is fueled by a ""complex mixed of grievances"" resulting from the loss of ancestral homelands, poverty, marginalization and poor governance, Esperon told senators.   ""The passage of the BBL is arguably the most effective legislative response to these grievances,"" he said during the resumption of Senate hearings into the measure. The proposed law will allow the country's main Muslim separatist group to transition into a political organization that participates in elections, he said.   Failure to pass the BBL, on the other hand, will result in ""the exact opposite -- a grimmer picture that is already taking form because of continuous delay [in the law's passage]."" The Moro people are growing dissatisfied with the peace process, as indicated by the 2016 bombings in Davao City and the terrorist siege of Marawi City last year, he said. ""One of the most pronounced threats is that of Muslim communities turning away from the peace process and providing dangerous opportunities for recruitment by violent extremist groups and the propagation of more radical views among the youth and the vulnerable sectors in Mindanao,"" he said. ""And that scenario -- the possibility of war in Mindanao -- as we have seen it and President Duterte is warning about, is not far off,"" he said."	Terrorism	Terrorism

Melbourne knife attacker named as known extremist	" MELBOURNE, Nov 10 — A Somali-born Australian who carried out a deadly knife rampage in Melbourne held extremist views and was known to intelligence services, authorities said today, as they carried out raids and interviewed dozens of witnesses. Australian Federal Police said 30-year-old Hassan Khalif Shire Ali — who was shot dead after driving a 4x4 laden with gas cylinders into the city centre and stabbing three people — fled to Australia as a child with his family in the 1980s. He stabbed three people before being confronted by members of the public and armed officers who eventually shot him in the chest. One of his victims died at the scene while two others were wounded. Authorities have questioned around 35 people who saw the rush hour attack, which although crude, was said to have been designed to “cause terror and cause maximum casualties” in the heart Australia’s bustling second city. Armed officers raided two addresses in the west and northeast of the city, linked to the perpetrator’s family and associates, although there is not thought to be an ongoing threat. The man killed by Shire Ali was named by local media as 74-year-old Sisto Malaspina, an icon of Melbourne’s thriving culinary culture who ran a famous Italian cafe. Two other men wounded in the attack are still being treated but are expected to make a recovery. Australian authorities now face difficult questions about how Shire Ali, who was known to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation for at least three years, was able to carry out an attack. He had his Australian passport revoked in 2015 amid fears he was trying to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State group. His brother will go on trial next year on separate terror-related charges — accused of trying to acquire a firearm and kill people in a New Years’ Eve crowd. “The assessment was made that whilst he had radicalised views he didn’t pose a threat to the national security environment,” Ian Mccartney, a federal police counterterrorism official said of Shire Ali. Mccartney described the attack as a “wake up call” even as the Islamic State loses territory in Iraq and Syria, where Australian forces are part of a coalition fighting the group. “The circumstances of how he and when he moved from having these radicalised views to carrying out this attack yesterday will be a key focus of the investigation,” Mccartney added. The Islamic State group — which often claims responsibility for such attacks — said via its propaganda arm that the perpetrator was an “Islamic State fighter and carried out the operation.” It provided no evidence to back its claim. Witness footage showed police struggling for at least a minute to corral the towering man as he lunged, slashed and stabbed wildly at two officers. At least two members of the public stepped in to help police. One man was armed with a cafe chair while another — swiftly dubbed an “Aussie hero” on social media — repeatedly tried to ram the suspect with an empty metal shopping cart. But the attacks continued unabated before one officer opted for lethal force, shooting the suspect in the chest. The officers “tried to verbally deescalate” said Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton. “Once the officer is off the view that there is an imminent threat to life,” he added. “That is when firearms are drawn.” Witness Chris Newport, 60, described how he had been returning from a job interview when he heard a loud noise and saw a truck on fire, rolling across the tram tracks before a second, louder bang. “In a split second everything changes” Newport told AFP, describing Shire Ali manically brandishing a knife. “You can’t imagine someone deciding to do that.” Police said that his improvised explosive device was made up of gas cylinders and some form of lighter and “certainly wasn’t sophisticated”. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the country would be unflinching in the fight against “radical, violent... extremist Islam that opposes our very way of life”. Shire Ali “sought to instill fear in our nation. Like those who tried before him, this terrorist failed,” he said. He cited more than a dozen foiled terror plots as evidence that Australians could have faith in their counterterrorism authorities. Melbourne is Australia’s second largest city, a cosmopolitan metropolis of almost five million people famed for its cafes, bars, restaurants and high standard of living. Yesterday’s attack was a double blow for the city as it coincides with an ongoing murder trial of 28-year-old James Gargasoulas, accused of ploughing his car into crowds in the same area in 2017, killing six people. The motives for that attack are still unclear. "	Terrorism	Terrorism
Home-grown terror group JAD remains a threat in Indonesia despite crackdowns: Experts	" JAKARTA (THE JAKARTA POST/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), an Indonesian home-grown terror group affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), remains a threat in the country despite recent crackdowns, the latest report by Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (Ipac) has said. ISIS is also known as Islamic State (IS). The report, issued last Thursday (Oct 18), said the terror group would continue to launch attacks even though law enforcers have been searching for its members across the country following deadly suicide bombings in Surabaya, East Java, in May. ""The defeats of the IS in the Middle East have not weakened the determination of IS supporters to wage war at home since they can no longer get to Syria,"" Ipac director Sidney Jones said. Future attacks, the Ipac said, might occur after ""a period of dormancy"" in which surveillance eases and complacency returns. The Ipac predicted such attacks might occur outside East Java, especially in areas around the West Java-Central Java border, such as West Java's Cirebon and Indramayu, as well as Central Java's Tegal, which was described by the researchers as regions where a ""critical mass of supporters was still active"", showing a high degree of militancy. The areas, the report said, have been producing terrorists since the deadly Thamrin attack in Jakarta in January 2016. Poso in Central Sulawesi also came under the spotlight in the Ipac report, especially after earthquakes and a tsunami hit the province on Sept 28, causing several prisoners to escape. While some returned, others are still at large to date. ""It is also not impossible that extremists could see the area as fertile recruiting ground, given unhappiness with the slow pace of aid deliveries and a well-entrenched extremist network in the area,"" the report said. University of Indonesia (UI) terrorist expert Ridwan Habib echoed the sentiment and warned that attacks might come ahead of the 2019 general election. In August, the South Jakarta District Court declared JAD a ""forbidden organisation"" and found it guilty of committing a number of terror acts. The ruling enables the police and their counter-terrorism squad Densus 88 to use newly added provisions in the Terrorism Law to prosecute individuals who intentionally recruit for or join an organisation declared a terror group by the court. As of Sunday (Oct 21), the police had conducted dozens of raids on suspected JAD members, including in the latest operation in North Sumatra. The North Sumatra Police said last Friday that its personnel killed two suspected terrorists and JAD members, and seized makeshift bombs, weapons and ammunition during a raid in Tanjung Balai, a day before they allegedly plotted attacks on temples and police stations in the city. Mr Ridwan, however, said law enforcement had yet to be effective in eradicating terror groups. ""The arrest in Tanjung Balai indicates there is coordination between JAD members and attempts to build bombs are still ongoing. There is no deterrent effect,"" he said. The Ipac also criticised the police's capability of monitoring people suspected of having a connection with terror groups, saying that ""surveillance of the (Surabaya bombing) perpetrators had stopped about three months before the attacks"". According to the report, JAD Surabaya leader Dita Oepriarto had shown more signs of deliberate interaction with neighbours to present an image of ""normal, pious Muslims"", while at the same time Dita had allegedly been assembling at least 100 pipe bombs. Dita, the suspected mastermind behind the suicide bombings in all three churches in Surabaya, blew himself up in one of the attacks. ""It was this willingness to engage with the community that became one factor in the police's decision to stop surveillance,"" the Ipac said."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Paris knifeman's murky path from 'reserved' student to extremist	"PARIS (AFP) - Khamzat Azimov, who kept his beard short over a youthful face, was not considered a major threat despite being on France's two watchlists for suspected extremists since 2016. ""It was his relatives who alerted the security services, as opposed to his behaviour, actions or ideas"" which might have drawn scrutiny, a source close to the inquiry told AFP. Yet on Saturday (May 12) night, the 20-year-old described by neighbours as a quiet student spread terror throughout a bustling area of restaurants and theatres just a short stroll from the historic Paris opera house. Former classmates from his Strasbourg high school described Azimov as a religious and ""very discreet"" student who liked video games and sports. The eastern French town where he grew up is home to a large community of refugees from Chechnya who fled the Muslim-dominated Russian republic during two bloody separatist wars against Moscow-backed forces. One ex-pupil told AFP: ""Khamzat was quite calm, he kept himself to himself, he didn't have a problem... He did Ramadan, he paid attention to girls."" The man who declined to be identified added that Azimov ""had a distinctive manner and was in contact with Syria where he wanted to go. But after the bac (exams) he left all that, he wanted to make a living."" Another former pupil described a ""normal student, not excellent but not bad either"". ""We knew he was Muslim but he did not show it,"" the young woman added, saying he never talked about his birthplace Chechnya or the wars there. Investigators have taken Azimov's parents into custody for questioning as well as a friend in Strasbourg. The conflict in Chechnya gave birth to a fierce Islamic insurgency that would eventually produce fighters who would join other militant groups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, which claimed responsibility for Saturday's attack in Paris. But a manager of the apartments in the northern 18th arrondissement of the French capital where the Azimovs rented a room said there was nothing overtly religious about the family. Calling them ""very discreet,"" the woman said ""there was nothing ostentatious in terms of religion"" and described Khamzat Azimov as a young man who favoured tracksuits and ""said he was a student"". A neighbour also spoke of ""a very discreet family, never any problems,"" adding that they ""never received visitors"". And the son ""wasn't a thug, but someone who was reserved,"" she added. ""They have been living here for a little over a year,"" said Reda, another resident in the building. ""The father worked sometimes, mostly in construction, painting. The mother worked for an association which helps the homeless,"" she said. Witnesses to Saturday's attack said Azimov remained composed as he began attacking people with a 10-centimetre (four inches) blade shortly before 9pm (3am Singapore time). ""He approached calmly, a total contrast with the panic all around him,"" said Romain, 34, who was placing an order with his wife and six-year-old son at the Starbucks cafe on the Avenue de l'Opera. ""He had a beard, not very long, and was dressed normally. He didn't fit the stereotype"" of a jihadist, he said. Investigators have yet to reveal how Azimov became radicalised. One source told AFP he had been questioned by anti-terror investigators last year ""because he knew a man who was in contact with a person who had gone to Syria."" He did not have a criminal record, and became a French citizen as a teenager in 2010 following his mother's naturalisation. But his attack echoed a similar one last October, when a knifeman who also carried no ID papers began stabbing people at the main train station in the southern city of Marseille, killing two people. That attack was also claimed by ISIS."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Melbourne knife attacker inspired by ISIS, say police; PM Morrison says terror threat 'probable' in Australia"	"MELBOURNE (REUTERS) - A Somali-born man who set fire to a truck laden with gas cylinders in the centre of Melbourne and fatally stabbed one person was inspired by Islamic State but did not have direct links with the group, Australian police said on Saturday (Nov 10). Police identified the man responsible for Friday's attack as 30-year-old Hassan Khalif Shire Ali and said he was radicalised and inspired by the militant group's propaganda. He was shot by police and died in hospital. Police said Shire Ali's Australian passport was cancelled in 2015 after an intelligence report he planned to travel to Syria, but an assessment was made that while he had radical views, he posed no threat to national security. Islamic State, also known as Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), had claimed responsibility for the attack, which came two days before Remembrance Day, marking 100 years since the end of World War One, without providing any evidence. ""I think it is fair to say he (Shire Ali) was inspired. He was radicalised,"" Australian Federal Police Acting Deputy Commissioner Ian McCartney told reporters in Melbourne. ""We're not saying there was direct contact. We're saying it was more from an inspiration perspective."" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the national terrorism advisory remained at ""probable"", the midpoint of a five-tier system, and told reporters in Sydney that radical Islam was the issue. ""I need to call it out. Radical, violent, extremist Islam that opposes our very way of life. I am the first to protect religious freedom in this country, but that also means I must be the first to call out religious extremism,"" he said. Friday's attack began just before the evening rush hour and lasted only minutes. Shire Ali stabbed bystanders and attacked police while his utility truck carrying barbecue gas cylinders burned on busy Bourke Street. The cylinders did not explode and the fire was put out in 10 minutes, by which point the attack was over, though not before one man was fatally stabbed. Police said he was a 74-year-old man who worked in the city, but did not release his name. Local media identified him as a restaurant owner. ""This shouldn't happen in a city like Melbourne,"" one witness who had returned to the scene on Saturday told Reuters, crying. ""I just want to forget it,"" she said. Video posted to Twitter and broadcast on television showed Shire Ali swinging a knife at two police officers, while the truck burned in the background, before he collapsed when one shot him in the chest. Victoria state police said counter-terrorism investigators were searching two properties in suburban Melbourne in connection with the attack, but there was no immediate word on what the searches yielded. At one, a modest one-storey brick house on the city's western fringe, armed officers wearing masks stood guard outside. Bourke Street also reopened on Saturday morning, and a Reuters reporter said there was an increased police presence in the area. A staunch US ally, Australia has been on alert for such violence after a Sydney cafe siege in 2014, and its intelligence agencies have stepped up scrutiny. Victoria Police Commissioner Graham Ashton said there was no warning of the latest attack. He said there was no longer a threat to the public, but that security would be boosted at horse races and Remembrance Day memorials over the weekend. Authorities say Australia's vigilance has helped foil at least a dozen plots, including a plan to attack Melbourne at Christmas in 2016 and a plan to blow up a flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi using a bomb disguised as a meat mincer. Two hostages were killed during the 17-hour Sydney cafe siege by a ""lone wolf"" gunman who was inspired by Islamic State militants."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Jakarta Hosts Subregional Security Meeting Focused on Changing Terrorist Strategies	"Nusa Dua. Chief Security Minister Wiranto and Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton led a subregional meeting on counterterrorism in Jakarta on Tuesday to discuss changing terrorist strategies and tactics. ""Terrorists have modified both their strategies and patterns of attack. They used to act as one organization, but now their attacks come from smaller units, or from self-initiated plans or lone wolves, also involving women and children,"" the Coordinating Ministry for Political, Legal and Security Affairs said in a statement. In his opening address, Dutton said the meeting serves as an important and timely opportunity to discuss ""the insidious and ever-adaptive threat of terrorism."" ""Regrettably, the threat of terrorism has not abated. Recent attacks in Indonesia were a sobering reminder of the influence of Islamic State in our region,"" he said, referring to the series of attacks in Surabaya, East Java, in May. Dutton added that the attacks were a reminder of the importance of regional cooperation to ""combat this very real and persistent threat."" He said one of the emerging challenges in the region is new and evolving technologies, such as encryption used by terrorists. Representatives of Brunei, Malaysia, Myanmar, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand also participated in the meeting held to promote cooperation between governments and civil society organizations to prevent the spread of radical and extremist ideologies. ""Enhanced cooperation with regional and global partners is imperative to get ahead of terrorist networks, their technology and their tactics,"" Dutton said. Wiranto meanwhile touched on how former terrorists can be part of counterterrorism strategies. ""They can be used to dismantle existing networks of foreign terrorist fighters,"" he said, as quoted by Suara Pembaruan. He added that foreign fighters pose as a real threat to the region because they have received training and experience in conflict areas, such as Syria and Iraq, where Islamic State is most active. The inaugural subregional meeting on counterterrorism took place in Manado, North Sulawesi, in July last year. This year's meeting was initially scheduled for Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara, in August but had to be postponed after a series of powerful earthquakes rocked the island."	Terrorism	Terrorism
 Germany uncovers terrorist group which attacked foreigners in Chemnitz	"related media assets (image or videos) available. Click to see the gallery. 3 related media assets (image or videos) available. Click to see the gallery. German police detained six men on Monday suspected of forming a far-right militant organisation which assaulted foreigners in the eastern city of Chemnitz and planning attacks on politicians and civil servants, the GBA federal prosecutor's office said. KARLSRUHE, Germany: German police detained six men on Monday suspected of forming a far-right militant organisation which assaulted foreigners in the eastern city of Chemnitz and planning attacks on politicians and civil servants, the GBA federal prosecutor's office said. Some 100 police officers backed by special commando units detained the six suspects aged 20 to 30 at locations in Germany's Saxony and Bavaria states. Authorities also revealed that another suspect had been taken into custody on Sept. 14. The men are accused of forming ""Revolution Chemnitz"", an organisation named after the city where the fatal stabbing of a German man blamed on migrants in August prompted the worst far-right violence in Germany in decades. ""Based on the information we have so far, the suspects belong to the hooligan, skinhead and neo-Nazi scene in the area of Chemnitz and considered themselves leading figures in the right-wing extremist scene in Saxony,"" prosecutors said. The group had planned to attack senior civil servants and politicians, they said. ""In the course of further investigations we encountered tangible indications that the organisation pursued terrorist goals,"" the GBA said in a statement. GBA spokeswoman Frauke Koehler told reporters that the authorities had intercepted communications which showed that the suspects were plotting attacks against political opponents as well as foreigners. Five of the suspects had attacked and injured foreigners in Chemnitz on Sept. 14 using glass bottles, steel knuckle gloves and tasers, the GBA statement said. The group had planned to carry out another attack on Oct. 3, the national holiday that marks the reunification of East and West Germany in 1991. The violence in Chemnitz, where skinheads hounded migrants and performed the illegal Hitler salute, exposed deep divisions over Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision in 2015 to welcome almost one million mostly Muslim asylum seekers. The events also strained Merkel's coalition government. Her conservatives and their Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners could not agree what to do with the head of the BfV domestic spy agency, who questioned the authenticity of a video showing skinheads chasing migrants. They reached a compromise last month to transfer him to the interior ministry, ending a row that almost felled their six-month-old government. The events in Chemnitz also raised questions about whether authorities in Saxony were too complacent in the face of rising far-right violence and xenophobia, in a country sensitive to whether the lessons of its Nazi past have been learned. The reputation of Germany's law enforcement was hurt by the handling of case of a neo-Nazi gang that murdered 10 people during a 2000-2007 campaign of racially motivated violence. Two members of the group, the National Socialist Underground (NSU), killed themselves in 2011 when police discovered the gang by chance. Another member was jailed for life in July. The Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper said investigators believed ""Revolution Chemnitz"" would have carried out more murders than the NSU. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said after the arrests on Monday that the threat of a militant attack in Germany remains high, which means ""an attack could take place any moment."""

Saudi Arabia says revamping education to combat ‘extremist ideologies’	"RIYADH, March 21 — Saudi Arabia is revamping its education curriculum to eradicate any trace of Muslim Brotherhood influence and will dismiss anyone working in the sector who sympathises with the banned group, the education minister said. Promoting a more moderate form of Islam is one of the promises made by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman under plans to modernise the deeply conservative Muslim kingdom. The education ministry is working to “combat extremist ideologies by reviewing school curricula and books to ensure they do not reflect the banned Muslim Brotherhood’s agenda,” al-Isa said in a statement issued on Tuesday. It would “ban such books from schools and universities and remove those who sympathise with the group or its ideology from their posts,” he added. In September, a large Saudi public university announced it would dismiss employees suspected of ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, adding to concerns that the government is clamping down on its critics in academia and beyond. Earlier this month, Crown Prince Mohammed told CBS in an interview that Saudi schools have been “invaded” by elements of the Muslim Brotherhood, which has been designated by Saudi Arabia as a terrorist organisation along with other militant groups such as al Qaeda and Islamic State. The young crown prince has already taken some steps to loosen Saudi Arabia’s ultra-strict social restrictions, scaling back the role of religious morality police, permitting public concerts and announcing plans to allow women to drive. The ruling Al Saud family has always regarded Islamist groups as a major internal threat to its rule over a country where appeals to religious sentiment resonate deeply and an al Qaeda campaign a decade ago killed hundreds. Since the kingdom’s founding, the Al Saud have enjoyed a close alliance with clerics of the ultra-conservative Wahhabi school of Islam who have espoused a political philosophy that demands obedience to the ruler. By contrast the Brotherhood advances an active political doctrine urging revolutionary action. A political Islamist organisation founded in Egypt nearly a century ago, the Muslim Brotherhood says it is committed to peaceful activism and reform through elections, and its adherents span the region, holding elected office in Arab countries from Tunisia to Jordan. Brotherhood members fleeing repression in Egypt, Syria and Iraq half a century ago took shelter in Saudi Arabia, some taking up roles in the kingdom’s education system and helping to establish the Sahwa or “Awakening” movement which agitated in the 1990s for democracy. The Sahwa mostly fizzled, with some activists arrested and others coaxed into conformity, though admirers and its appeal lingered."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Parliament: Bigger budget vital to deal with terror threat, says Shanmugam"	"The scourge of terrorism looming over Singapore is the leading force pushing the country to budget 11 per cent more than last year to secure its home front. The increase, which will swell the purse of the Home Affairs Ministry to $6.48 billion in financial year 2018, is vital, Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said yesterday. The reason is that the threat from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) extremist group will grow in the region following its defeat in the Middle East. As its fighters return to the region, the ministry ""must do all it can to protect our people"", he said during the debate on his ministry's budget. ""It is our responsibility and accountability to deal with terrorist threats in Singapore,"" he added. The need to invest more in the light of this menace was also underlined by Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat in the Budget Statement he unveiled last week. The threat is at the highest level in recent years, Mr Heng said. Its significance is reflected as well in the nod given to the increase, even as Mr Heng told government agencies their annual budget growth from next year will be reined in to 0.3 per cent from 0.4 per cent of gross domestic product. To battle the terror threat as well as crime, the ministry will triple its annual investments in high-tech solutions in the next two years, said Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo. While terrorism occupied a large part of the speeches of both political leaders, the drug menace was a major concern too. They said the immediate focus in the fight against drugs is on measures to protect victims and rehabilitate offenders. The growing number of Singaporeans who pursue work and educational opportunities abroad may have to wrestle with dissenting views more squarely. Foreign business partners, schoolmates or friends may at times express fundamental disagreement with Singapore's decisions, policies or actions. They could even persuade you to adopt their viewpoint at the expense of supporting our national interests... We need a psychologically resilient people, able to withstand crisis or viral attacks, and not be rattled. If someone comments negatively about Singapore and our immediate response is not to verify the facts, but to instead condemn Singapore and, worse, spread the untruths, we are creating for ourselves a hole in our defence that our adversaries would not hesitate to jump at and widen the divide. SENIOR MINISTER OF STATE FOR DEFENCE MALIKI OSMAN, on correcting falsehoods about Singapore. As for the battle against terrorists, Mr Shanmugam said his ministry will play the lead role, with the police as the ""first and main responders"" in a terror attack. This position is spelt out in Singapore's legal and constitutional frameworks, which state that the ministry is responsible for internal security, including managing the crisis and its aftermath. In the event of a large-scale attack, the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) can be brought in to support the police as an auxiliary force, tapping its specialised units like the Special Operations Task Force. ""To this end, the police and SAF have developed joint plans and conducted joint exercises,"" he said. The ministry may also get other government agencies and ministries, such as the Health Ministry and the Communications and Information Ministry, to support its operations, he added. Joint exercises will be held, and these are necessary for all parties to sharpen their response plans, said Mr Shanmugam. Mrs Teo said that Singapore must also guard against social fault lines to make it harder for terrorists to carry out attacks, and ""to think twice before they target us"". As a precautionary move, the Government introduced the Public Order and Safety (Special Powers) Bill this week to give the police powers to, among other things, issue an order to stop people, including the media, from communicating information that can compromise police operations. The new Act adds to the arsenal against terrorism, which was reinforced last year when the Infrastructure Protection Act was introduced and changes made to the Public Order Act. In addition, Mrs Teo said, ""every Singaporean has a role to play, and that is why community partnership is a key part of the Home Team's work and also why we launched the SGSecure movement"". Correction note: An earlier version of this report said that the Public Order and Safety (Special Powers) Bill was passed this week, when in fact it was only tabled for the first reading. A stop order under the proposed Act can be placed against all kinds of communication -- photos, text, audio and graphics -- that could compromise police operations. We are sorry for the error."

 EU piles pressure on internet giants to remove extremist content	"related media assets (image or videos) available. Click to see the gallery. 2 related media assets (image or videos) available. Click to see the gallery. Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and other internet companies must show the European Union within three months that they are removing extremist content more rapidly or face legislation forcing them to do so. BRUSSELS: Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and other internet companies must show the European Union within three months that they are removing extremist content more rapidly or face legislation forcing them to do so. Several governments have increased pressure on social media companies to do more to remove illegal content - from material related to groups such as Islamic state and incitement to commit atrocities - and the sector has increased efforts to demonstrate its progress. But in its strongest call yet to the technology sector the European Commission on Thursday recommended measures that internet platforms should take to stop the proliferation of extremist content, including the removal of such material within an hour of being notified of its existence. European governments have said that extremist content on the web has influenced lone-wolf attackers who have killed people in several European cities after being radicalised. ""While several platforms have been removing more illegal content than ever before ... we still need to react faster against terrorist propaganda and other illegal content which is a serious threat to our citizens' security, safety and fundamental rights,"" Digital Commissioner Andrus Ansip said in Thursday's statement. European online trade association EDiMA, whose members include Google, Facebook and Twitter, said it was dismayed the Commission had not first chosen to engage in dialogue. A one-hour turn-around time might also not be workable, it said. The recommendation, which is non-binding but could be taken into account by European courts, sets guidelines on how companies should remove illegal content generally - from copyright infringements to hate speech - and advises a quicker reaction to extremist material. The Commission said it would assess the need for legislation within three months for what it described as ""terrorist content"", given the urgency of the issue. For all other types of illegal content it will assess progress made within six months. It also called on the technology sector, which is dominated by U.S. companies, to adopt proactive measures such as automated detection to rid their platforms of illegal content. Campaign group the Counter Extremism Project said the Commission's proposal was welcome but did not tackle two issues - how to make automated technology widely available and how to stop extremists uploading again content that had been removed. European Digital Rights, a civil rights group, described the Commission's approach as putting internet giants in charge of censoring Europe. Only legislation would ensure democratic scrutiny and judicial review. Luxury groups, meanwhile, welcomed the Commission's move saying action by online platforms is also necessary to fight the sale of counterfeit goods online. ""Proactive measures coupled with good consumer information is the only way to effectively deal with illegal content online,"" said Toni Belloni, group managing director of LVMH."	Terrorism	Terrorism
" Britain is facing serious far-right terrorism threat, says top UK officer"	"LONDON: Britain faces a new and significant threat from organised far-right terrorism, the UK's most senior counter-terrorism officer said on Monday as he revealed police had foiled four plots by right-wing extremists in the last year. ""The right-wing terrorist threat is more significant and more challenging than perhaps public debate gives it credit for,"" Mark Rowley, London's Assistant Commissioner, told reporters. Britain has been a prime target for homegrown and foreign Islamist militants since the 2001 attacks on the United States. But Rowley said until the last two years, far-right activity was limited to unpleasant protests and hate crimes, with serious incidents limited to the actions of isolated individuals. The MI5 domestic spy agency are now involved in investigating the far-right and he warned that British groups were seeking links with international extremists. ""It's a significant part of the terrorist threat. Right-wing terrorism wasn't previously organised here,"" Rowley said. ""There are many Western countries that have extreme right-wing challenges and in quite a number of those the groups we are worried about here are making connections with them and networking,"" he said, declining to give further details because it was a new, live intelligence phenomenon. Last year, there were five deadly militants attacks in Britain including one carried out by a man who drove a van into worshippers leaving a London mosque after developing a hatred of Muslims by reading extreme right-wing material online. The previous year, a Nazi-obsessed loner murdered lawmaker Jo Cox in a frenzied street attack a week before the referendum on the European Union. Since then, Britain has banned National Action and two other spin-off groups, the first extremist right-wing organisations to be outlawed since the 1940s. ""For the best part of 18 months in the UK we have a homegrown, white supremacist, neo-Nazi terrorist organisation that is pursuing all the ambitions of any other terrorist organisation committed to violence,"" Rowley said. ""That should be a matter of great concern for all of us."" Since the first of the 2017 deadly attacks last March, Rowley said police had foiled 10 Islamist conspiracies and four far-right plots, although he said he could not provide details of these as they were subject to ongoing court cases. To show the overall scale of the threat Britain faced, he said there were 600 terrorism investigations currently ongoing involving more than 3,000 suspects. Over the last three years, terrorism arrests had doubled while in the same period some 2,000 people have been referred to the government's counter-radicalisation Prevent programme, with a third of these over far-right concerns, he said. Rowley, who next month steps down from the role he took on in 2014, said Islamist and far-right extremists were a toxic combination, feeding off each other and pursuing the same agenda of division, fear and hatred. He reiterated British concern about extremists' use of the internet and said he expected technology and internet firms would react to a mixture of persuasion and regulation as the banking sector had done. He also said it was important that an agreement struck with the European Union for when Britain leaves the bloc in 2019 did not damage relations with their European colleagues. ""Whatever the arrangements, we need something that provides at least a good a platform for cooperation as we have today,"" he said."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Amsterdam: ‘Terrorist motive’ alleged in attack on Americans	"By the Associated Press AMSTERDAM — A 19-year-old Afghan citizen had a “terrorist motive” for allegedly stabbing two Americans at the main train station in Amsterdam, city authorities in the Dutch capital said Saturday. Amsterdam police shot and wounded the suspect after the stabbings Friday at Central Station. The local government said hours later it appeared the people injured weren’t targeted for a specific reason, but added that investigators had not ruled out terror as an aim or any other possibilities. After the US ambassador to the Netherlands identified the victims as American tourists Saturday, Amsterdam City Hall gave an update. “Based on the suspect’s first statements, he had a terrorist motive,” the city administration said in a statement that did not elaborate on what the statements were or how they showed intent. The wounded Americans were recovering in a hospital from what police termed serious but not life-threatening injuries. Their identities have not been released. The suspect, who was identified only as Jawed S. in line with privacy rules in the Netherlands, also remained hospitalized. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte confirmed on Twitter that the investigation focused Saturday on exploring the extremist ideas that allegedly inspired the train station attack. The Netherlands’ counter-terror chief, Dick Schoof, tweeted that the country’s threat level would remain at number four on a scale that tops out at five. “Sadly, this reprehensible act fits into the current threat assessment,” he said. W. had a residency permit from Germany. German authorities searched his home and seized data storage devices that would be analyzed as part of the investigation, the city government statement said. He was scheduled to be arraigned during a closed-door hearing with an investigating judge on Monday. Dutch officials did not disclose the charges he could face. A statement issued late Friday by Amsterdam’s city council said the Americans did not appear to have been victims of a targeted attack. Amsterdam authorities also said Friday that it appeared from initial inquiries that the victims weren’t chosen for a clear reason. The local government said Saturday it had no immediate plans to beef up security in the city, saying the swift action by police “shows that Amsterdam is prepared for this kind of incident.” A passerby’s dramatic photo showed two police officers pointing guns at a man in blue jeans and sneakers lying on the ground inside a train station tunnel. Earlier Saturday, the US ambassador to the Netherlands confirmed that the two people injured Friday were Americans visiting the Netherlands when they were stabbed at the station. Ambassador Pete Hoekstra issued a written statement saying US Embassy officials had been in touch with the victims or their families. “We wish them a speedy recovery and are working closely with the City of Amsterdam to provide assistance to them and their families,” Hoekstra said. Central Station is a busy entry and exit point for visitors to Amsterdam, with regular trains linking it to the city’s Schiphol Airport. Friday is one of the busiest days of the week for train travel as tourists arrive for the weekend. The station is patrolled by armed police and other security staff."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Extremist slain, 3 dead after rampage in southern France"	"TREBES, France (AP) — A gun-wielding extremist went on a rampage Friday in a quiet corner of southern France, killing three people as he hijacked a car, opened fire on police and took hostages in a supermarket, where panicked shoppers hid in a meat locker or ran through the aisles. After an hours-long standoff, the 25-year-old attacker was slain as elite police forces stormed the market. They were aided by a heroic police officer who had offered himself up in a hostage swap and suffered life-threatening wounds  as a result — one of 16 people injured in the day’s violence. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack near Carcassonne, a medieval city beloved by tourists, and the town of Trebes. It was the deadliest attack in France since Emmanuel Macron became president last May. The officer who volunteered to take the place a female hostage was identified as Col. Arnaud Beltrame. He managed to surreptitiously leave his cellphone on so that police outside could hear what was going on inside the supermarket. Officials said once they heard shots inside the market they decided to storm it. A police official who was not authorized to be publicly identified confirmed the officer’s identity to The Associated Press. Macron said investigators will focus on establishing how the gunman, identified by prosecutors as Moroccan-born Redouane Lakdim, got his weapon, and how he became radicalized. On Friday night, authorities searched a vehicle and a building in central Carcassonne. Lakdim was known to police for petty crime and drug-dealing. But he was also under surveillance and since 2014 was on the so-called “Fiche S” list, a government register of individuals suspected of being radicalized but who have yet to perform acts of terrorism. Despite this, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins there was “no warning sign” that Lakdim would carry out an extremist attack. A woman close to Lakdim was taken into custody over alleged links with a terrorist enterprise, Molins said. He did not identify her. The four-hour drama began at 10:13 a.m. when Lakdim hijacked a car near Carcassonne, killing one person in the car and wounding the other, the prosecutor said. Lakdim then fired six shots at police officers who were on their way back from jogging near Carcassonne, said Yves Lefebvre, secretary general of SGP Police-FO police union. The police were wearing athletic clothes with police insignia. One officer was hit in the shoulder, but the injury was not serious, Lefebvre said. Lakdim then went to a Super U supermarket in nearby Trebes, 60 miles (100 kilometers) southeast of Toulouse, shooting and killing two people in the market and taking an unknown number of hostages. Special police units converged on the scene while authorities blocked roads and urged residents to stay away. He shouted “Allahu akbar! (God is great)” and said he was a “soldier of the Islamic State” as he entered the Super U, where about 50 people were inside, Molins said. “We heard an explosion — well, several explosions,” shopper Christian Guibbert told reporters. “I went to see what was happening and I saw a man lying on the floor and another person, very agitated, who had a gun in one hand and a knife in the other.” Guibbert said he led his wife and sister-in-law and nearby customers into the meat locker. Then he went back to see where the assailant was and called police to describe the situation. “At that moment, he (the gunman) ran after me. Of course I left, I lost him and when I turned around he wasn’t there anymore. I took an emergency door and saw the police arrive,” Guibbert said. Another witness, an employee of the supermarket’s butcher department identified only by his first name, Jacky, told Europe 1 radio he “heard people shouting and a big ‘boom.'” “It was a gunshot,” he said. “Then a second gunshot. After that, my colleagues came toward me saying: ‘Come on Jacky, we need to leave! There’s someone who’s firing shots, he’s shouting “Allahu akbar,” and he’s shot people and he’s shooting at everything.'” He said they left using an emergency exit behind the butcher’s stall and they ran across the courtyard. “We also helped people get out,” he said. During the standoff, Lakdim requested the release of Salah Abdeslam, the sole surviving assailant of the Nov. 13, 2015, attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. The interior minister suggested, however, that Abdeslam’s release wasn’t a key motive for the attack. The IS-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group’s calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition carrying out airstrikes against IS militants in Syria and Iraq since 2014. France has been repeatedly targeted because of its participation. Both Interior Minister Gerard Collomb and Molins praised Beltrame, who Molins said “at the risk of his life took the choice to take the place of the hostages.” The gunman shot Beltrame several times after threatening to blow up the supermarket if police entered, Molins added. BFM television said Beltrame recently took part in a training exercise simulating a terrorist attack. As the supermarket standoff reached a crescendo about 2:20 p.m., police heard gunshots inside the building and decided that elite forces had to storm it. Lakdim was killed and two other officers were wounded during the assault, Collomb said. “He acted alone, there was no one else but him,” he added. Macron rushed back from an EU summit in Brussels to Paris, where counterterrorism investigators took over the investigation. France has been on high alert since a series of extremist attacks in 2015 and 2016 that killed more than 200 people. While France hasn’t had an attack in several months, “the threat remains high,” Macron said, describing ongoing risks from “several individuals who radicalized themselves.” Macron pushed through a tough counterterrorism law last year that gives police extra powers to conduct searches and hold people under house arrest. In Brussels, German Chancellor Angela Merkel appeared with Macron and said, “When it comes to terrorist threats, we stand by France.” Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the Eiffel Tower would turn its lights off at midnight in tribute to the victims. At the national stadium outside Paris, 80,000 soccer fans and the national teams of France and Colombia observed a minute of silence Friday night to honor those killed in the attacks earlier in the day. Poignantly, the stadium itself was the site of bloodshed in the deadly Paris attacks in 2015."	Terrorism	Terrorism
UN experts: Al-Qaeda greater threat than IS in some places	"By the Associated Press Al-Qaeda’s global network remains “remarkably resilient” and poses a greater threat than the Islamic State extremist group in several regions, including Yemen and Somalia, UN experts say. The panel of experts monitoring sanctions against both groups said in a report to the UN Security Council, obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press, that Al-Qaeda affiliates also “remain a threat at least as serious” as IS in West Africa and South Asia. In a separate report circulated Tuesday, UN experts said IS poses “a significant and evolving threat around the world” despite recent setbacks in Iraq, Syria and the southern Philippines that forced the militants to relinquish strongholds. The new report said unidentified UN member states highlighted that some Al-Qaeda and IS members “have been willing and able to support each other in the preparation of attacks,” which poses “a potential new threat” in some regions. “In addition, Al-Qaeda propaganda continues to highlight a new generation of potential leaders, such as Hamza bin Laden … in an apparent attempt to project a younger image to its sympathizers,” the experts said. Bin Laden is the son of Osama bin Laden, who masterminded the Al-Qaeda terrorist attack on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001, that killed nearly 3,000 people and injured over 6,000. He called on Muslims around the world in an audio message in November to avenge his father’s killing in 2011 by US Navy SEALS. In Syria, the experts, said some unnamed governments also highlighted that the Nusra Front “remains one of the strongest and largest Al-Qaeda affiliates globally.” It aims to absorb smaller groups in Syria though some members argue that the Nusra Front should have “a more international outlook” and not concentrate only on Syria, they said. The Nusra Front remains the dominant force in the Al-Qaeda-linked Hay’at Tahrir al Sham coalition — Arabic for Levant Liberation Committee, also known as HTS — with between 7,000 and 11,000 fighters, including several thousand foreigners, the experts said. The group is entrenched and able to make money in its stronghold in Idlib province, they said. But since the report was written, Idlib has come under intense attack by Syrian government forces. According to the assessment of UN member states, the experts said Al-Qaeda also “remains a serious threat within the Arabian peninsula,” plotting attacks in the wider Middle East as well including a July 2017 plot targeting Jordan that was planned in Yemen and disrupted. The experts said Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is playing a leading role in Al-Qaeda’s propaganda and communications activities. In West Africa, the experts said member states highlighted that the threat from groups related to Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State continues to spread through Mali as well as neighboring countries. Over the course of 2017, they said, most “terrorist entities” operating in the Sahel region established formal links with either IS or Al-Qaeda. “However, to date, no rivalry between the various groups has been observed,” the experts said. In East Africa, they said the Al-Qaedaa affiliate al-Shabab “remains resilient and has sustained its dominance” over IS affiliates in Somalia. It also poses a greater threat than IS to the African Union peacekeeping force in the country. “In 2017, al-Shabab pursued its goal of establishing a presence beyond Somalia and conducted operations seeking to set up bases in Kenya, Ethiopia and Djibouti,” the experts said. In Afghanistan, the experts said, unnamed governments highlighted an increase in opposition fighters, estimating there could be as many as 60,000 fighters loyal to the Taliban combined with members of various Al-Qaeda-affiliated groups. There are more than 20 groups active in the country, with the Taliban the largest at about 40,000 to 45,000 fighters, the experts said. In South Asia, Al-Qaeda affiliates and Islamic State extremists are taking advantage of “the volatile security situation in Afghanistan,” the experts said. Islamic State losses in Iraq and Syria also are raising “the threat to Southeast Asia, as its funds and fighters are scattered around the world,” the report said. The region has seen “a marked increase in terrorist attacks” in recent years, with at least 10 IS-inspired attacks in Indonesia alone in the first half of 2017, it said. Since IS lost its strongholds, its propaganda machinery “is further decentralizing and the quality of its material continues to decline,” the experts said. Nonetheless, they added, IS fighters, supporters and sympathizers still use social media, encryption technology and the dark web to communicate with each other “and motivate and facilitate attacks.” IS also continues to move funds across the Middle East using “hawala” money transfer networks and cash couriers, and it is “penetrating legitimate businesses in the region by using seemingly unconnected or ‘clean’ individuals with access to the financial system as fronts,” the report said."

Hero French policeman dies after jihadist shooting spree	"TRÈBES, March 24 — A French policeman who was shot and stabbed after swapping himself for a hostage in a rampage and siege President Emmanuel Macron branded ""an Islamist terrorist attack"" died of his wounds today, becoming the gunman's fourth victim. Lieutenant-Colonel Arnaud Beltrame, 45, was among a group of officers who rushed to the scene in the town of Trebes in southwest France yesterday after the attacker, who claimed allegiance to the Islamic State group, stormed a supermarket and fired at shoppers and staff. Beltrane offered to take the place of a woman the gunman had taken hostage and was shot and badly wounded before anti-terror police moved in to kill the attacker and end the siege. ""Lieutenant-Colonel Arnaud Beltrame has passed away. He died for his country. France will never forget his heroism,"" Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said on his Twitter account. Macron earlier paid tribute to the bravery of the police officer. ""He saved lives and honoured his colleagues and his country,"" Macron said. With the death of the officer, the assailant, identified as 25-year-old Radouane Lakdim, killed a total of four people in France's first major jihadist attack since October. ""Our country has suffered an Islamist terrorist attack,"" Macron said in a televised address following the rampage in the medieval town of Carcassonne and nearby Trebes. The Islamic State group claimed the attack was in response to its call to target Western enemies — as is customary when the assailant has pledged allegiance to the jihadists. The shootings come as France remains on high alert following a string of deadly attacks that have killed more than 240 people since 2015. Top anti-terror prosecutor Francois Molins said the gunman had convictions for carrying a banned weapon and for drug use. ""He had been on a watchlist for his radicalisation and links to the Salafist movement,"" Molins told reporters in Carcassonne, adding that Lakdim had been tracked for his online contacts with extremists. Security sources said Lakdim was born in Taza in northern Morocco and held French nationality. His partner, who lived with him in Carcassonne, has been detained, Molins said. Lakdim started his rampage in Carcassonne at around 10:30am (0930 GMT), hijacking a car and shooting the two people inside, Molins said. The passenger was killed, and the driver remains in a critical condition. Lakdim then shot and wounded a police officer who was out jogging with colleagues before driving to nearby Trebes where he burst into the Super U supermarket. ""The attacker entered the store shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest) and saying he was a soldier of the Islamic State, ready to die for Syria,"" Molins said. He further demanded ""the release of his brothers"" from prison before shooting a supermarket customer and an employee dead. ""I was five metres away from him,"" the store's security guard said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""He shot at me twice."" Luckily for the security guard, ""he shot badly."" About 50 people were in the supermarket at the time, and though some people managed to escape, several remained inside. Beltrame offered to take the place of a woman Lakdim was using as a human shield while his colleagues negotiated with the gunman, the interior minister said. The officer ""left his telephone on the table"" to allow police who had surrounded the building to listen in, Collomb said. When special forces heard shots they stormed the store, killing the gunman and recovering Beltrame, who had been seriously wounded. He was shot twice and stabbed several times by the attacker, a source close to the investigation told AFP. Trebes, a sleepy town of 5,000 people along the Canal du Midi, was on lockdown throughout yesterday as helicopters swirled overhead and heavily armed and masked police carried out a massive operation in Lakdim's neighbourhood. The fact that Lakdim had been monitored as a potential extremist will raise difficult questions for Macron's government as to how he slipped through the net. ""We had monitored him and did not think he had been radicalised,"" Interior Minister Collomb said after flying to the scene. ""He was already under surveillance when he suddenly decided to act."" In Paris, the Eiffel Tower dimmed its lights at midnight in a mark of respect for the victims and a minute's silence was held at the Stade de France before a football match between France and Colombia. Yesterday’s violence took place in a part of France still scarred by a killing spree in 2012 in the city of Toulouse and nearby Montauban where another jihadist, Mohamed Merah, shot dead seven people including three Jewish schoolchildren. That assault marked the first of several big Islamist attacks in France since 2015, including the massacre at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, the November 2015 attacks that killed 130 in Paris, and a summer 2016 truck attack during Bastille Day festivities in Nice. The most recent assault came in October when a Tunisian man stabbed to death two women at Marseille's railway station, shouting ""Allahu Akbar"". A state of emergency put in place just after the 2015 Paris attacks was lifted last October when Macron's centrist government passed a new law boosting the powers of security forces."

 Maldives promises to monitor and block radical websites	"MALÉ, Jan 15 —The Maldives has promised to block websites seeking to radicalise its Muslim population, officials said, as the US warned extremist groups may attack with little warning in the honeymoon islands. Defence Minister Adam Shareef said authorities were monitoring radical websites and social media accounts and would shut down any trying to recruit or influence Maldivians. “We have been noticing some information on websites and open sources that lead to people becoming more radicalised,” Shareef told reporters in Male late Monday. The Maldives had warned of past efforts by foreign extremists to groom its citizens but had refrained from censoring or blocking online material considered risky. Authorities had begun identifying and closely tracking several radical websites in the wake of Shareef’s declaration, said sources close to the matter who wished to remain anonymous. The cyber crackdown came less than a week after the US issued an updated travel warning for visitors to the Indian Ocean archipelago, urging them to exercise increased caution due to terrorism. “Terrorist groups may conduct attacks with little or no warning”, the statement read, including on remote islands where the response time by authorities would be lengthened. The Maldives are popular for tourists seeking surf, pristine beaches and paradise getaways. But the islands have been plagued by political turmoil and nascent fears of Islamic extremism in recent years, denting its image as an upmarket honeymoon destination. There have been no recent attacks targeting tourists in the nation of nearly 1,200 tiny coral islands scattered across the equator. But nearly 60 Maldivians are known to have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight with foreign jihadists, and some are believed to have returned home. Maldives President Abdulla Yameen warned in 2016 that violent Islamic extremism posed one of the biggest threats to the 340,000 Sunni Muslims living on the popular holiday islands."

 Islamic State claims deadly French supermarket siege	"TREBES, March 24 — A gunman claiming allegiance to the Islamic State group killed three people in a shooting spree and supermarket hostage siege in southwest France yesterday before anti-terror police shot him dead. Five people were also shot and wounded in France’s first major jihadist attack since October, including a heroic policeman who offered to take the place of hostages being held at the supermarket. “Our country has suffered an Islamist terrorist attack,” President Emmanuel Macron said in a televised address following the rampage in the medieval town of Carcassonne and nearby Trebes.

A Portuguese national was among those killed, the government in Lisbon confirmed.

"Singapore arrests, deports self-radicalised Malaysian worker"	" SINGAPORE, Feb 9 — A self-radicalised Malaysian who worked for an airfreight company here has been deported after being arrested under the Internal Security Act (ISA) last month, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said today. Muhammad Nur Hanief Abdul Jalil, 33, worked as a driver with the company and had access to the Changi Airfreight Centre, a restricted area. The centre provides airfreight services to Changi Airport. Investigations did not point to Hanief having attempted to radicalise others or planned to launch terrorist attacks in Singapore. “(But) his radicalisation renders him a security threat to Singapore. His work pass was therefore cancelled, and he was repatriated to Malaysia in Feb 2018,” the MHA said in a statement. The ministry said the Malaysian had been going online since 2008 to peruse the teachings by foreign extremist preachers such as Imran Hosein, Zakir Naik and Anjem Choudary. He became convinced that he should travel to Syria or Palestine to take part in the armed conflict, and decided to act on his plan late last year. “He was prepared to join any militant group there”, including the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, MHA added. The Malaysian police have taken Hanief into custody, and he is being detained under the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 (Sosma) for further investigation, TODAY understands. Sosma replaced the repealed Internal Security Act in 2012 and is used by Putrajaya to combat terrorism. Under Sosma, police may detain a suspect for 28 days and withhold legal representation for two days. "	Terrorism	Terrorism
East Asia Summit members to boost security cooperation	"With the world facing renewed anxieties over nuclear warfare and grappling with the threat of cyber attacks and terrorism, Asean nations and eight of their key partners yesterday vowed to step up cooperation in a range of security areas. East Asia Summit (EAS) members agreed to do more to tackle returning foreign fighters, beef up cyber security, and ensure the safe and secure use, storage and transport of nuclear and other radioactive materials. They also said they would press on with efforts on the Asean Smart Cities Network, a flagship deliverable under Singapore's Asean chairmanship this year, and the fight against plastic litter in the oceans. The 18-country EAS - which groups all 10 Asean members plus Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, Russia and the United States - released five statements after its meeting yesterday. ""South-east Asia is on the frontline,"" he told his counterparts as he wrapped up their discussion. The region is not just a recruiting ground for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), it is also a target in the extremist group's expansion plans, he added. ISIS, after all, has made clear that it wants to set up a caliphate in South-east Asia. The prolonged siege in Marawi in the Philippines may have ended, but insurgents have regrouped, PM Lee pointed out. And ISIS has been linked to terrorist attacks in Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, as well as close to 50 thwarted attack plots - including one against Singapore. ""The region also faces heightened threat of attack from returnee fighters and lone wolves,"" he said. ""Therefore, it is more important than ever for continued cooperation among countries."" Among other things, EAS members pledged to get the public - including young people, women, families, religious leaders and community groups - more involved in efforts to inoculate the community against violent extremism. They also agreed to share information on foreign fighters - including on their movements and financial information - in a timely manner, and do more to stop them from crossing borders. With cyber security under discussion, the EAS members said they were determined to promote secure and resilient information and communications technologies (ICT) infrastructure, noting that this can contribute to regional security and stability. They will work together to promote an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful ICT environment - which is critical to connectivity and economic development - and, recognising that some states may lack the capacity to protect their networks, provide help on issues such as developing technical skills. They also recognised the importance of strengthening cooperation on personal data protection. They said they would address the digital divide and development gap by supporting initiatives such as helping micro, small and medium-sized enterprises make use of these technologies. It is important to ensure the safety and security of nuclear and other radioactive materials, EAS members said. They agreed that nuclear energy and technology could play useful roles in fields such as medicine, agriculture and energy. Acknowledging that all states have the right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, consistent with international law, they pointed out that acts of nuclear terrorism could pose a threat to international peace and security. The members encouraged all states to build a robust domestic nuclear safety and security regime and conduct exercises to prepare their communities for incidents involving radioactive materials. They reaffirmed that non-state actors should be prevented from developing, acquiring, transporting or using nuclear weapons. They also took aim at a problem plaguing the environment: The rise of plastic litter in the oceans, which places marine biodiversity, as well as industries such as fisheries, maritime transport and tourism at risk. More can be done, including in improving the management of plastic waste, promoting research and education on marine plastic debris, and enhancing cooperation in policy reform and law enforcement. EAS members also recognised that developing a regional smart cities ecosystem will help the region weather challenges arising from rapid urbanisation and allow them to ""harvest the opportunities associated with the ongoing digital and fourth industrial revolution"" for better economic, social and environmental outcomes. The Asean Smart Cities Network, they agreed, would help uplift the lives of Asean citizens. ""There is still much more to be done for the EAS to evolve into an anchor platform for maintaining regional peace, stability and prosperity,"" said PM Lee. He added: ""I am confident that with the continued support of participating countries, the EAS will continue to grow from strength to strength, and play an essential role in strengthening our open, inclusive and Asean-centric regional architecture."""

California man pleads guilty to fighting in Syria	"CHICAGO, Nov 1 — A California man who came to the US from Syria as a refugee and later returned there to fight with an extremist group pleaded guilty yesterday to terrorism-related charges. Aws Mohammed Younis al-Jayab, 25, admitted that he flew from Chicago to Turkey in November 2013 and then entered Syria where he joined and fought with Ansar al-Islam, which is designated as a terrorist organization, the Department of Justice said in a statement after the guilty plea in Chicago. Al-Qaeda affiliate Ansar al-Islam (Partisans of Islam) once operated in both Iraq and Syria. Its Iraqi faction later merged with the Islamic State group, though some of its Syrian fighters rejected IS. Jayab faces up to 15 years in prison for his plea to a charge of providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization, and up to eight years for a second guilty plea, providing a false statement to federal agents. When he returned to the United States in January 2014 Jayab did not declare his travel to Turkey and Syria, the Department of Justice said. In a later interview with federal agents he denied supporting terrorist groups. At the time of Jayab’s arrest, US Attorney Benjamin Wagner stressed that “while (Jayab) represented a potential safety threat, there is no indication that he planned any acts of terrorism in this country.” Jayab, an Iraqi-born Palestinian, came to the United States from Syria as a refugee in 2012, US officials said at the time of his arrest. He will be sentenced on April 26 next year."	Terrorism	Terrorism
 AFP continues to gain ground against terrorists	" The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Tuesday said it continues to gain ground against communist terrorists and other terrorist groups as recent developments show they are experiencing significant setbacks following the intense military operations conducted by the security forces nationwide. In a statement, the AFP Public Affairs Office said the number of New People’s Army (NPA) regulars and supporters coming back to the folds of the law continue to increase. Just last week, 16 communist terrorists from the NPA, including four women and two child warriors surrendered to the Philippine Army’s 53rd Infantry Battalion in Poblacion, Zamboanga del Sur. On Sunday three members of the Southern Mindanao Regional Command of the NPA voluntarily surrendered to the local chief executives of barangays Lumiad, and Magsaysay, Carmen, Davao del Norte. A certain alias Ramo, vice commander of the Pulang Bagani Command 1, SRC5, SMRC; an alias Marvin/Isak, team leader of Andoy Primera of the same group, and an alias Joa, medic of the same group, all surrendered to the government forces. Upon their debriefing, they gave information that led to the recovery of a CAP2 landmine, a cal .38 revolver, and 400 rounds of ammunition. “Nakikita natin na nawalan na ng suporta galing sa masa ang mga rebeldeng grupo na ito kaya sila ay tuluyan nang nagbalik loob sa gobyerno (We can see that the rebel groups are losing support from the masses that’s why they returned to government fold),” AFP Chief of Staff Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr., said. “Ang mga sumurender ay matataas ang katungkulan sa kanilang organisasyon. Sila na din ang nagsabi na hirap na sila at wala nang nakikitang rason upang lumaban pa sa ating pamahalaan (Those who surrendered have high positions in their organization. They are also the ones who said they are suffering and they don’t see any reason to fight the government),” he added. In a simple ceremony led by the Task Force Balik Loob on September 27, 64 former NPA members were formally welcomed to the society in Nabunturan, Compostela Valley. They have undergone Enhanced Comprehensive Local Integration Program (E-CLIP) for former rebels. Other former rebels in Southern Mindanao were also provided with livelihood and cash benefits in a program held in Nabunturan, Compostela Valley on September 29. “It is not too late for you (NPAs) to surrender and leave your current miseries from fighting a useless cause.” Galvez said. The troops of 90th Infantry Battalion recently foiled a bombing plot of the extremist group, Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters, after acting on a report from a concerned civilian that the BIFF was planning to transport an improvised explosive device (IED). The IED was found inside a passenger jeepney at a checkpoint in Brgy Capiton, Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao Monday morning. A red passenger jeepney traversing the national highway from Ganta, Kabuntalan, North Cotabato was flagged by the military personnel and found the suspected IED. The civilian tipster said Kamsali Taguitikan and Rasol, under Karialan faction of the BIFF, are planning to transport the IED from the marshy area of Brgy Palongoguen in Midsayap, North Cotabato to conduct terror attack in Cotabato City. The elements of 3rd Explosive Ordnance Disposal team of the Army immediately arrived in the area and safely disrupted the IED. Recovered in the scene were one 81mm, one 60mm, two batteries (dry cell), one roll electrical tape, and wires. “I commend all the troops who successfully foiled another terror attack that might have killed innocent civilians. I remind every unit and every soldier, airman, sailor, and marine not to let our guards down against terrorists,” Galvez said. “We will continue to intensify our checkpoints and our operations against all these groups that pose a threat to our communities. I call on every individual to be vigilant and actively involved in reporting any suspicious person or activity in their localities. Only with that degree of vigilance of our people, combined with the unceasing efforts of the government security forces can we as a nation stop these terrorists.” Galvez added."	Terrorism	Terrorism
 Radicalised Singaporean IT engineer detained under Internal Security Act	" A radicalised Singaporean engineer, who wanted to travel to Syria to take up arms in support of the terrorist group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), has been detained under the Internal Security Act (ISA). Ahmed Hussein Abdul Kadir Sheik Uduman, 33, was detained last month after investigations showed he was radicalised, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said in a statement yesterday. The information technology (IT) engineer, who had sought religious knowledge online since 2013, was found to be following the lectures of several foreign radical ideologues, said the ministry. They include radical Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, an Al-Qaeda ideologue who was killed in 2011 in a US drone strike in Yemen, and several other clerics who have been arrested or jailed for inciting violence or espousing support for terrorism. Ahmed ""grew to believe that the use of violence in the name of religion was justified"" and by late 2016 was convinced he should fight and die as a martyr for ISIS in the terror group's self-proclaimed caliphate in the Middle East, said the ministry. He maintained regular contact with pro-ISIS foreigners on social media to keep up with the developments overseas and also tried to influence some of his foreign online contacts to follow the violent teachings of the radical ideologues he had been following because he wanted them to support ISIS. Commenting on the detention in a Facebook post, Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Masagos Zulkifli said: ""This new case shows that the threats of self-radicalisation and terrorism remain real...We must stand together to protect our peace and harmony in Singapore."" Mr Masagos, who is Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, also reiterated the Muslim community's firm stance against extremist teachings. He urged people to look out for one another and to refer those who show signs of radicalisation to the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis), Religious Rehabilitation Group or the police. Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu, who noted the Muslim community's efforts in fighting radicalism, said in a Facebook post: ""The actions of the misguided few must not be allowed to define an entire community. We must stand together with our Muslim friends, because every one of us has a role to play in upholding trust among communities in Singapore."" Muis, also weighing in, warned of the dangers of seeking religious knowledge online and called on the Muslim community to turn to credible sources such as religious teachers registered under the Asatizah Recognition Scheme. Meanwhile, a housewife who was radicalised online and had wanted to travel to the Middle East to join ISIS, was released from detention in July after her Order of Detention was suspended, said MHA. Munavar Baig Amina Begam, 39, ""no longer posed an imminent security threat that required her to be placed in preventive detention"", it added. Instead, she has been issued with a Suspension Direction, which requires her to abide by several conditions and restrictions. For example, she is not allowed to change her residence or employment, or travel out of Singapore without the prior approval of the director of the Internal Security Department (ISD). She also cannot issue public statements, address public meetings or print, distribute, contribute to any publication, or hold office in or be a member of any organisation, association or group without the prior approval of the ISD director.

Duterte orders soldiers: Kill enemies of the state	" President Duterte has assured the military of his full support as he ordered soldiers to “destroy and kill” enemies of the state, particularly the Islamic State and al-Qaida terrorist groups. “I assure you that you have my full support as you conduct intensive military operations against these terrorist groups, particularly those who subscribe to the extremist ideologies of the Islamic State and al-Qaida,” the President said in a speech at Camp Teodulfo Bautista atBarangay Bus-bus in Jolo, Sulu. “That’s just a bankrupt, inutile ideology. They only know how to destroy and kill, destroy and kill. So my order to you: Destroy and kill also. Why be at a disadvantage?” he added. President Duterte assured the soldiers that they are not alone in their fight to protect the country. “With your bravery, selflessness and patriotism, I am optimistic that we will one day defeat all threats to our democratic institutions and secure a brighter future for our beloved country,” he said. The President added: “The Filipino people stands beside you, and I stand with you every step of the way as we advance the common good and promote the safety of our nation.” He also reminded them to always keep themselves safe even as they carry out their duties of fighting threats and protecting the country. “Take extra care. Do not be an extraordinary hero. Just take cover for as long as you can… In real life, ensure your safety first, then you kill,” he said, noting that a soldier’s life is harder than what appears in the movies. He also assured soldiers that he would provide for their needs and whatever they ask for in order to survive. “Every time that you need me and everything that you need to survive, I’ll give it,” the President said. President Duterte also commended the Joint Task Force Sulu for its relentless pursuit operations against threat groups such as the Abu Sayyaf. “I therefore commend the Joint Task Force Sulu for your relentless efforts against various threat groups in your area of operations, especially the Abu Sayyaf,” he said."

Gov’t forces nab bomb expert in Maguindanao	"Combined elements of the military and police today arrested a bomb expert and his wife after a predawn raid on a terrorist lair in Maguindanao. The operation also resulted in the death of 15 members of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), wounding of eight others, the destruction of an IED (improvised explosive device) factory of the DAESH-(al-Dawla al-Islamiya fi al-Iraq wa al-Sham, translated as Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) inspired terrorists recovery of a certain number of IEDs. The Army’s 6th Infantry Division led by Brig. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana spearheaded the counterterrorist operations against the Dawlah Islamiyah Toraife Group in the boundary between Pagalungan and General Salipada K. Pendatun. Backed by Philippine Air Force air assets, ground troops of the Army’s 33rd Infantry Battalion led by Lt. Col. Harold M. Cabunoc, 4th Special Action Battalion led by Police Supt. Darwin Padla, and 61st Division Reconnaissance Company led by 1st Lt. Ruel Fortuna, stormed the terrorist lair in the Liguasan marsh. The terrorists traded fires with the 33rd IB troopers but they were outmaneuvered after about an hour of firefight, prompting two terrorists to surrender. Cabunoc identified the duo as Ustadz Anwar Ali, 22, and Asnaya Ali, 20. The soldiers confiscated a Cal 50 Sniper Rifle and s Cal 5.56mm M4 Carbine from the suspects. “The suspects threw their weapons and improvised bombs in the water when we blocked all their escape routes. Ustadz Anwar is known as Abu Omar, a bomb expert in the group,” Cabunoc said. Sobejana has directed his troops to cordon off all escape routes as another group pursues the remnants of the elusive terrorist group. “We will not allow these terrorists to spoil the peace in Central Mindanao. We will protect the people against those who espouse violent extremism,” Sobejana, who is the concurrent Joint Task Force central commander, said. “We ease the fear of our people and assure them that safety procedures were undertaken and deliberately planned by JTFC giving due concern to the safety of the civilian populace,” he added. Sobejana said appropriate coordinations were made with the MILF CCCH and the targeted areas were confined to locations far from the local communities. “I am very determined to defeat these threat groups and prevent them from doing terroristic activities to bring about peace in Central Mindanao. We urge the continued support and cooperation of our people in the communities to hasten the attainment of peace and development,” Sobejana said. “Let us be partners in preventing and countering the efforts of the radical extremist groups in sowing fear and violence. I am calling the community to be vigilant and committed to peace,” he said. The Philippine Army soldiers hoisted the national flag after defeating the terrorists in their remote marshy hideout in the Liguasan Marsh."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Police get wider powers to deal with serious incidents	"A new law that expands police powers to allow officers to respond swiftly and with greater flexibility during serious incidents like a terrorist attack was passed yesterday after a three-hour debate. Under the Public Order and Safety (Special Powers) Act, the police commissioner can impose measures such as a curfew and a stop order on communications to ensure the secrecy of security operations. But the Act may be invoked only with the authorisation of the Home Affairs Minister, Second Minister for Home Affairs Josephine Teo said yesterday, following concerns expressed by MPs during the debate on the proposed legislation. Other safeguards are also in place to ensure the police commissioner and the minister exercise their special powers only for specified incidents, where the police are likely to be in a race against time, Mrs Teo added. ""Once the threshold of a serious incident is crossed, we must give the police sufficient latitude to act decisively,"" she told the House on the final day of a three-day sitting. The new law comes in the wake of a ""clear and continuing threat"" of a terror attack facing Singapore, which has been cited as a target in extremist publications and videos. During the debate, Nominated MP Kok Heng Leun, who was among 10 members of the House who spoke on the proposed legislation, expressed concern over the discretion given to the minister and police commissioner. Mr Kok asked if there could be conditions on the use of the special powers, and cited the Internal Security Act, which requires the minister's decision to be concurred by the president on the advice of a special advisory committee. Replying, Mrs Teo stressed that the special powers will not be used for day-to-day policing, but only for specified incidents like a terrorist act or large-scale public disorder. ""Members will have to weigh: Which is the bigger risk in a serious incident? Which has the graver consequence?"" she said. ""There is a risk of too much discretion, but there is also a risk of too much delay."" Mrs Teo also said that after an incident has been dealt with, Parliament can still debate if the minister and police had done the right thing and hold them to account - as was with the 2013 Little India riot. This new law repeals the Public Order (Preservation) Act, which allowed Parliament to annul the minister's proclamation as a safeguard. This will no longer be the case. ""There is no sinister reason for this,"" said Mrs Teo. "" Judicial review of the minister's decision to make an activation order remains an avenue to curb improper use... of his powers."" She noted that the old Act was used only once since independence, and it was after the Little India riot. ""Even then, it was tightly scoped, to control the consumption of alcohol, to calm the situation and prevent further violence,"" she said. Another concern raised is what constitutes reasonable force, during which lethal weapons can be used. Mrs Teo said lethal weapons are used only if the police have no other choice, and cited the Shangri-La Dialogue incident in 2015, in which a car sped through a police checkpoint. Police had to use ""reasonable force"", including lethal weapons, as it was a high-profile event involving foreign dignitaries, and there was a risk the driver was committing a terror act. Almost all the MPs sought clarification on the communications stop order, which can make it an offence to take photos or videos of an incident area when the order is activated. Mrs Teo said: ""Police will exercise discretion and take into consideration the circumstances under which the recorder was in and if the breach could not have been reasonably avoided."""

Indonesia prosecutors demand death for radical leader over 2016 attacks	" JAKARTA, May 18 — Indonesian prosecutors this morning demanded the death penalty for a radical cleric over his role in a 2016 terror attack committed by a group linked to wave of suicide bombings this week. Dozens of officers from an elite unit were sent to guard the trial of Aman Abdurrahman who is accused of authorising a gun and suicide attack in the capital Jakarta two years ago that left four attackers and four civilians dead. They were the first attacks claimed by Islamic State in Southeast Asia. Abdurrahman — considered the de facto head of all IS supporters in Indonesia — is also the spiritual leader of local extremist network Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD). Authorities said JAD was behind the 2016 attack and suicide bombings in Indonesia’s second-biggest city Surabaya this week. Two families — including a 9 and 12 year old girl — blew themselves up at churches and a police station, killing 13. Authorities have not charged Abdurrahman, 46, over this week’s attacks. This morning, prosecutors called for Abdurrahman to be executed for the 2016 attacks. “We demand this panel of judges sentence Aman Abdurrahman to death,” lead prosecutor Anita Dewayani, told the South Jakarta district court. Abdurrahman is already in jail on a separate terror conviction. The families who committed the suicide bombings knew each other and belonged to the same religious study group, along with third family linked to the attacks. All had ties to JAD with the father of the church suicide bombers identified as a local leader in the group. "	Terrorism	Terrorism
 Another family behind Indonesia suicide bombings	"SURABAYA—A family of five, including a child, carried out the suicide bombing of a police headquarters in Indonesia’s second city Surabaya on Monday, police said, a day after a deadly wave of attacks on churches staged by another family. The spate of bombings has rocked Indonesia, with the Islamic State group claiming the church attacks and raising fears about its influence in Southeast Asia as its dreams of a Middle Eastern caliphate fizzle. Indonesia has long struggled with Islamist militancy, including the 2002 Bali bombings that killed over 200 people-mostly foreign tourists—in the country’s worst-ever terror attack. Security forces have arrested hundreds of militants during a sustained crackdown that smashed some networks, and most recent attacks have been low-level and targeted domestic security force. But that changed Sunday as a family of six—including two young girls—staged suicide bombings of churches during morning services in the country’s second biggest city Surabaya, killing 14. On Monday, members of another family attacked the police station in Surabaya, wounding 10. “There were five people on two motorbikes. One of them was a little kid,” national police chief Tito Karnavian said. “This is one family.” An eight-year-old girl from the family survived the attack and was taken to hospital, while her mother, father and two brothers died in the blast, he said. The church attacks were claimed by the Islamic State group. The father of the church suicide bombers was a local leader in extremist network Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) which supports IS. “It ordered and gave instructions for its cells to make a move,” Karnavian said of the church attacks. He added that the attacks may have also been motivated by the arrest of JAD leadership, including jailed radical Aman Abdurrahman, and were linked to a deadly prison riot staged by Islamist prisoners at a high-security jail near Jakarta last week. Abdurrahman has been connected to several deadly incidents, including a 2016 gun and suicide attack in the capital Jakarta that left four attackers and four civilians dead.Despite their apparent allegiance to IS, the church-bombing family were not returnees from Syria, police said Monday, correcting their earlier statements. However, hundreds of Indonesians have flocked in recent years to fight alongside IS in its bid to carve out a caliphate ruled by strict Islamic law. Its efforts have been fizzling quickly as it has lost most of the land it once occupied in Iraq and Syria. On Sunday evening, just hours after the church bombings, a further three people in another family were killed and two wounded when another bomb exploded at an apartment complex about 30 kilometers from Surabaya. Police said the father in the church bombings-Dita Oepriyanto?was a confidante of the man killed in the apartment, who police said had a bomb detonator in his hand when he was shot by authorities. “The father was Dita’s close friend,” said Karnavian, the police chief. “When we searched the flat we found pipe bombs, similar to pipe bombs we found near the churches.” Indonesian police have foiled numerous terror plots, but the coordinated nature of Sunday’s church bombings and the subsequent blasts point to more sophisticated planning than in the past, analysts said. “There is definitely a growing technical proficiency,” than in past attacks, said Zachary Abuza, professor and Southeast Asian security expert at the National War College in Washington. “To pull off three near simultaneous bombings is hallmark of a group that is thinking.” Abuza questioned the police suggestion that the attacks were ordered by the IS leadership abroad, but said the group would likely keep up its influence in Southeast Asia as it fades elsewhere. “(They’re) going to continue to benefit from operating transnationally in Southeast Asia,” he added."

Terror group JAD still a threat in Indonesia	" JAKARTA • Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), an Indonesian home-grown terror group affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), remains a threat in the country despite recent crackdowns, the latest report by the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (Ipac) has said. The report, issued last Thursday, said the terror group would continue to launch attacks even though law enforcers have been searching for its members across the country following deadly suicide bombings in Surabaya, East Java, in May. ISIS is also known as Islamic State (IS). ""The defeats of the IS in the Middle East have not weakened the determination of IS supporters to wage war at home since they can no longer get to Syria,"" Ipac director Sidney Jones said. Future attacks, the Ipac said, might occur after ""a period of dormancy"" in which surveillance eases and complacency returns. The Ipac predicted that such attacks might occur outside East Java, especially in areas around the West Java-Central Java border, such as West Java's Cirebon and Indramayu, as well as Central Java's Tegal, which was described by the researchers as regions where a ""critical mass of supporters was still active"", showing a high degree of militancy. The areas, the report said, have been producing terrorists since the deadly Thamrin attack in Jakarta in January 2016. Poso in Central Sulawesi also came under the spotlight in the Ipac report, especially after earthquakes and a tsunami hit the province on Sept 28, causing several prisoners to escape, and some of them are still at large. University of Indonesia (UI) terrorist expert Ridwan Habib echoed the sentiment and warned that attacks might come ahead of the 2019 general election. In August, the South Jakarta District Court declared JAD a ""forbidden organisation"" and found it guilty of committing a number of terror acts. The ruling enables the police and their counter-terrorism squad Densus 88 to use newly added provisions in the Terrorism Law to prosecute individuals who intentionally recruit for or join an organisation declared a terror group by the court. The North Sumatra police said last Friday that its personnel killed two suspected terrorists and JAD members during a raid in Tanjung Balai, a day before they allegedly plotted attacks on temples and police stations in the city. The Ipac criticised the police's capability of monitoring people suspected of having a connection with terror groups, saying that ""surveillance of the (Surabaya bombing) perpetrators had stopped about three months before the attacks"". According to the report, JAD Surabaya leader Dita Oepriarto had shown more signs of interaction with neighbours to present an image of ""normal, pious Muslims"" during which he had allegedly been assembling at least 100 pipe bombs. The suspected mastermind behind the suicide bombings in all three churches in Surabaya, he blew himself up in one of the attacks. ""It was this willingness to engage with the community that became one factor in the police's decision to stop surveillance,"" the Ipac said."	Terrorism	Terrorism

 Indonesian IS-linked militant jailed for seven years	" JAKARTA, Feb 12 — The Indonesian leader of an Islamic State-linked militant group was jailed for seven years today over plans to smuggle weapons from the southern Philippines, a court said. Zainal Anshori, 43, head of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, was found guilty of committing a “criminal act of terrorism” by the Jakarta court. His group is believed to be responsible for several terror plots in Indonesia including a January 2016 attack in Jakarta that left eight people dead, including four militants. The cache of some 50 weapons, which did not reach their destination, were intended to be used in future attacks in Indonesia, the court said. Indonesia, the world’s biggest Muslim majority nation, has been on heightened alert following a string of IS-inspired attacks and plots. Many jihadists from Indonesia — which has long struggled with Islamist militancy — have in recent years travelled to join IS in Syria and the Philippine city of Marawi. Foreign and local IS supporters ravaged Marawi before being defeated in October, ending a five-month conflict with the military that left about 1,100 people dead. Last week, a Jakarta court sentenced an Islamist militant to ten years in prison for buying a cache of guns from a rebel group in the Philippines"	Terrorism	Terrorism
Police nab JAD E. Java leader Abu Umar	"The police have captured a man suspected of being the leader of pro-Islamic State (IS) terror group Jamaah Ansharud Daulah’s (JAD) East Java chapter in Malang, following a series of bombings earlier this week in the provincial capital Surabaya. The man has been identified as 37-year-old Syamsul Arif, also known as Abu Umar. The arrest was confirmed by National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian during a live television talk show on Tuesday. “[We have not] only captured the leader of Surabaya’s [JAD] chapter, but we have also arrested the leader of JAD’s East Java chapter in Malang,” Tito said as quoted by tribunnews.com. According to Antara news agency, the confirmation was echoed by East Java Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Frans Barung Mangera on Wednesday, when he said Abu Umar was among the 18 people apprehended by the National Police’s counterterrorism squad Densus 88 between Monday and Tuesday. According to the police, Umar was arrested along with his wife Wahyu Mega Wijayanti in a rented house in Malang early Tuesday morning. However, counterterrorism and radicalism expert Rakyan Adibrata questioned the importance of Abu Umar. Unlike Jamaah Islamiyah (JI), JAD has a loose chain of command, meaning that even if the police arrested one of its leaders, the individual attacks would not stop. “In JAD there is no chain of command; actions can be taken without collective decision-making as in JI,” Rakyan told The Jakarta Post on Thursday. Also due to the loose chain of command in JAD, there will likely be a leadership vacuum in East Java, he said, as the next leader would be decided by prominent JAD ideologue, Aman Abdurrahman, who is currently in detention. Nonetheless, he added, Abu’s arrest would still benefit Indonesia’s counterterrorism efforts. “The arrest will still help [the police] in discovering more JAD networks in East Java and preventing plans for individual terror attacks,” Rakyan said.

"What is JAD? Terror group behind Mako Brimob riot, Surabaya bombings"	"Multiple deadly bombings in East Java and the brutal killing of six police officers at the Mobile Brigade headquarters (Mako Brimob) in Depok, West Java, which took place within less than a week have catapulted Jamaah Ansharud Daulah (JAD) into notoriety. JAD, the largest local terror group pledging allegiance to the Islamic State (IS) group, has played a significant role in the terror attacks. ""[The attacks] are connected to JAD, which is the main supporter of ISIS in Indonesia and was founded by Aman Abdurrahman,"" National Police chief Gen. Tito Karnavian confirmed on Sunday. A family of suicide bombers linked to JAD attacked three churches across Surabaya on Sunday morning, killing at least 12 people and injuring 41 others. Two attempted bombings were reported at two other churches in the East Java capital. Later the same day, another explosion was reported at a low-cost apartment in the neighboring city of Sidoarjo. The latest attack took place on Monday morning, when a bomb exploded at the Surabaya Police headquarters. In total, 25 people, including 13 suicide bombers, were killed and dozens injured in the series of bombings in Surabaya, which resembled the pattern of attacks carried out by the Jamaah Islamiyah (JI) movement at dozens of churches across Indonesia at the start of the millennium. JI is said to have renounced violent jihad, leaving pro-IS group JAD as the most lethal terror group in the archipelago. But what is JAD? And how influential is its founder, Aman? Aman Abdurrahman (center), the alleged mastermind of the Jan. 14, 2016 suicide bombings and gun attacks on Jl. MH Thamrin, Central Jakarta, during a court hearing in South Jakarta District Court on Feb. 15. (kompas.com/Nursita Sari) The Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC) calls JAD ""the largest faction of ISIS supporters in Indonesia,"" consisting of followers of pro-IS ideologue Aman and Jamaah Anshorul Tauhid (JAT) leader Abu Bakar Baasyir. The term JAD, which means ""Partisans of the [Islamic] State Group,"" was previously a generic term referring to anyone who had sworn allegiance to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, but is now specifically used by a group that was formed in Malang in November 2015 and has chosen Aman as its ideological head. Aman was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2004 after a failed terror plot in Depok, West Java, and was released for good behavior in 2008. Soon after his release, Aman collaborated with Ba'asyir to form a joint terrorism training camp in Aceh in 2010 that united the different terrorist groups, leading to another prison sentence of nine years. Despite being behind bars, Aman has been accused of involvement in several other terrorist attacks across Indonesia, including masterminding the deadly Jan. 14, 2016, Thamrin attacks in Central Jakarta. The firebrand cleric, who graduated from the Institute for Islamic and Arabic Studies (LIPIA), was also allegedly involved in the May 25, 2017, bombings in Kampung Melayu, East Jakarta, that killed three policemen. Aman and his followers believe that all security forces of an ansharut thoghut (idolatrous state) should be considered kafir (non-believers), whose property can be seized and blood can be shed. Barbed wire installed at the entrance to the National Police Mobile Brigade headquarters (Mako Brimob) in Depok, West Java, following a riot on Tuesday night. (Warta Kota/Maulana Mahardihka ) After the declaration of the Islamic State by al-Baghdadi at Mosul, Iraq in June 2014, Aman believed that the Hegira, or emigration to Syria, was the obligation of all ISIS supporters. Shortly before the 2016 Thamrin attacks Aman issued a fatwa that was widely circulated among extremist groups: ""Emigrate to the Islamic State and if you cannot emigrate, then wage jihad with spirit wherever you are, and if you cannot wage war or you lack the courage to do so, then contribute your wealth to those who are willing to do so. And if you cannot contribute, then urge others to undertake jihad. And if you cannot do that, then what is the meaning of your loyalty oath [bai’at]?"" The terror inmates who rioted last Tuesday evening at the Mako Brimob detention center reportedly demanded to speak with Aman, who is being held at the facility, during initial negotiations with police officers, a demand that the police later met. The police, Tito said, suspected that the Surabaya bombings were motivated by the police's actions in arresting leaders of JAD. ""They reacted [to the arrests] by carrying out retaliatory attacks, such as that which occurred at Mako Brimob."" The terrorists' decision to launch the attacks in Surabaya, Tito said, may have been related to the recent conviction of the leader of JAD's East Java chapter, Zaenal Anshari, for smuggling weapons to Indonesian militants in the southern Philippines. Zaenal is the second-in-command in JAD after Aman. The incidents in Depok and Surabaya were part of a number of recent terror attacks or attempted attacks allegedly orchestrated by JAD-linked militants. Residents stand next to human body parts at a scene where two bombers launched an attack at Kampung Melayu bus terminal in East Jakarta on May 25, 2017. ADEK BERRY / AFP (AFP/Adek Berry) Since the Thamrin bombings in January 2016, counterterror officials have thwarted numerous attempted attacks by suspects affiliated with JAD in various regions across Indonesia. In January 2017, the US State Department said it had designated JAD as a terrorist group, which in practice prohibits US citizens from being involved with it. The deadly riot at Mako Brimob, which led to a 36-hour standoff between terror inmates and security forces, and the string of bombings in East Java, may have shown that the group has ramped up its capability to launch terror attacks."

Densus 88 officers shoot dead W. Java police shooters	" The National Police’s Densus 88 counterterrorism squad shot dead on Monday two individuals who were allegedly involved in the shooting of two police officers on the Kanci-Pejagan toll road near Cirebon, West Java. ""Two suspects, identified by the initials IA and RS, resisted arrest and tried to shoot police officers. Therefore, we took a tough and measured action [to shoot them],” National Police spokesman Insp. Gen. Setyo Wasisto said on Monday as quoted by Antara. RS reportedly was a member of the Cirebon chapter of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), a homegrown terror group that was recently banned. The police suspected it was a revenge attack over the arrest in July of RS’ in-law for alleged involvement with the JAD. In Monday’s operation, two others were arrested on suspicion that they assisted the main suspects during the shooting on Aug. 24. At that time, two traffic officers, First Adj. Insp. Dodon Kusdianto and First Adj. Insp. Widi Harjana, were conducting a routine patrol on the Kanci-Pejagan toll road when they encountered three men sitting on the side of the toll road. The officers, thinking that the men needed assistance, stopped to help but were shot at by one of the suspects as they approached. Dodon died in a hospital several days later, while Widi has shown signs of improvement after being treated. The police also arrested three other suspects on Sunday. ""Several individuals allegedly indirectly involved with the shooting are still at large,” Setyo said. "	Terrorism	Terrorism
Pro-Islamic State hackers threaten terror attacks against Indonesian government	" KUALA LUMPUR:  A group claiming to be pro-Islamic State (IS) hackers has threatened to attack the Indonesian government to avenge the “jailing” and “killing” of its “brothers”, a senior counter-terrorism source told Channel NewsAsia on Thursday (Aug 23). The hackers, who call themselves Hacktivist 1435 Anshar Caliphate Army, issued the threat in a video clip which Channel NewsAsia has seen. In the clip, the hackers expressed anger at the government for blocking the social media accounts of pro-IS groups. They vowed to unleash terror on the government in the “real” and “virtual” world. “It has been discovered from the monitoring of covert online social media, sympathisers of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) have posted terror threats from Hacktivist 1435 Anshar Caliphate Army,” the counter-terrorism source told Channel NewsAsia. “The recording was posted on Aug 13.” The one-minute long recording contained only English audio and Bahasa Indonesia subtitles. Calling themselves “the Islamic State hacking division” and addressing the message to the Indonesian government, the group said: “You have oppressed our brothers, jailed, killed and tortured our brothers ... you have done this in the real world.” JAD is the largest pro-Islamic State group in Indonesia and has been blamed for a string of terror attacks in the country, including last May’s suicide bombings on three churches and a police station. The terror group was founded by Aman Abdurrahman, Indonesia’s foremost IS ideologue who was sentenced to death last June for inciting five terror attacks. “You have blocked the social media accounts of my brothers in cyberspace. We will fight and terrorise you in the real world and in cyberspace,” the hackers said in the recording. “We will give out the (government) accounts that we have hacked for our Anshar Khilafah brothers to continue their ... jihad. We will find you and we will kill you. Expect us.” Indonesian police are looking for the person who uploaded the video, according to the counter-terrorism source. AUSTRALIA ISSUES TRAVEL ADVISORY FOR INDONESIA OVER POSSIBLE TERROR THREATS In a message posted on its website on Thursday (Aug 23), Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade warned that terrorists may be planning attacks in Indonesia. “We continue to receive information indicating terrorists may be planning attacks in Indonesia. Due to heightened security concerns, staff at the Australian Consulate-General in Surabaya will not be attending an event at the Airlangga University in Surabaya on 23 August,“ the department said. “Australian officials in Surabaya are currently adopting enhanced security measures and limiting their movements. Exercise a high degree of caution in Indonesia, including Bali and southern Lombok.”"	Terrorism	Terrorism
 Pro-IS cleric Aman declines to appeal death sentence	"Pro-Islamic State (IS) cleric Aman Abdurrahman has instructed his lawyer not to file an appeal against his death sentence for inciting various terror attacks in the country. “It has been seven days since the final hearing, and we have not filed an appeal against the sentence,” lawyer Asludin Hatjani said on Friday, as quoted by kompas.com. Therefore, he said, Aman would be transferred from the detention center at the  National Police’s Mobile Brigade headquarters in Depok, West Java, to another, as yet unspecified, higher-security prison. South Jakarta District Court found Aman, the de facto leader of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), a local affiliate of the IS terrorist group, guilty last week of inciting others to commit at least five terror attacks, including the bomb and gun attack on Jl.

Pro-ISIS Indonesian cleric Aman Abdurrahman won't appeal against death sentence	" JAKARTA (THE JAKARTA POST/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Radical Indonesian cleric Aman Abdurrahman has instructed his lawyer not to file an appeal against his death sentence for inciting various terror attacks in the country. ""It has been seven days since the final hearing, and we have not filed an appeal against the sentence,"" lawyer Asludin Hatjani said on Friday (June 29), as quoted by the Kompas news website. As such, he said, the pro-ISIS cleric would be transferred from the detention centre at the National Police's Mobile Brigade headquarters in Depok, West Java, to another as yet unspecified higher-security prison. The South Jakarta District Court on June 22 found Aman, the de facto leader of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), guilty of inciting others to commit at least five terror attacks. The JAD is a local affiliate of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terror group. Those attacks included the gun and suicide-bomb attack in Jakarta in 2016 that left four bystanders dead, a church-bombing in Samarinda, East Kalimantan that same year that killed a child, and the Kampung Melayu bombings in east Jakarta last year where three police officers died. The 2016 attack was the first claimed by the ISIS group in South-east Asia. Prosecutors had sought the death sentence for Aman, arguing that although some of the perpetrators of the attacks had never met him, his writings that were made available online had inspired others to launch the attacks."

"Searching for love online, Indonesian maids vulnerable to being recruited by Islamic State: Documentary"	"KUALA LUMPUR: Indonesian maid Ika Puspitasari was earning good money and, by some account, had a “glamorous life” within her own community while working in Hong Kong in 2016. But the domestic helper, who had previously worked in Malaysia, felt lonely, bored and “empty” with her single status in Hong Kong. Turning to Facebook in search of meaning and companionship, she stumbled upon a news report of a church bombing in Solo, Central Java in 2011 which someone had posted. She started commenting on it. Her comments drew the attention of pro-Islamic State (IS) militants in Indonesia from a group called Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD). They contacted her and soon she was invited into JAD’s Telegram channel. From then on, they had her in their thrall. She started donating money to their cause. She later married an Indonesian IS member online and agreed to be a suicide bomber. “In the Indonesian diaspora there is a cluster of people who are agreeble to become suicide bombers,” said Indonesian counter-terrorism expert and documentary film-maker Noor Huda Ismail. Huda is also the founder of the Institute for International Peace Building, a non-governmental organisation established in January 2008 in response to threat of terrorism. Ika is featured in Huda’s latest documentary called Pengantin, which means bride. The word bride is a codeword for “suicide bombers’ in Indonesian jihadi language. The documentary also features another female suicide bomber, Dian Yulia Nova, 32, who was jailed for seven years for plotting to blow herself up outside Jakarta’s presidential palace during the changing of the guard in 2016. Dian worked as a maid first in Singapore and later in Taiwan. It was in Taiwan that she became radicalised online and later married a pro-IS militant who turned her into a suicide bomber. Her husband was also responsible for recruiting Ika. “There are many cases of maids falling in love online, including those working in Hong Kong. Many of them get conned. By coincidence, those who con them are terrorists,” said Huda. “I want to highlight here that we have a problem,” said Huda. “It (documentary) is a simple story about three women searching for love on social media. Two of them ended up with problematic men while the third was successful in marrying a decent man,” said Huda. “I made this film for these women (migrant women), to warn them that whatever they read and encounter on social media, please verify it. Don’t believe everything you read online,” said Huda. According to the World Bank, Indonesia has 6.5 million migrants workers, 78 per cent of them women. Indonesian maids working overseas, especially in developed societies like Hong Kong, are vulnerable to recruitment by Islamic State as they are seen as potential sources of “funds”  as they enjoy good salaries and have a steady income flow. “One of the important messages in the film is that, since they (maids) have money, they have to be careful,” said Huda. “Money provides independence, self-confidence, but it also provides possible risks because they will be seen and approached by irresponsible men who offer love and protection,” said Huda. “They (militants) just want to use them, especially their money. Marriage is one of the ways to gain control (of the women).“ But the numbers are not large. An estimated 45 out of 150,000 Indonesian domestic helpers in Hong Kong are involved in pro-Islamic State (IS) activities, from funding air tickets to Syria to marrying militant fighters online, according to a 2017 report by the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC). Fuelling the women’s vulnerability to men offering them so-called love and marriage is the Indonesian culture where marriage is seen as a status symbol for women. “For Indonesian women, marriage provides for them not only a partner but social status,” said Huda. INDONESIAN SUB-CULTURE VIEWS RELIGIOUS MEN AS BEING OF HIGH STATUS Living in secular societies like Hong Kong, where the culture and way of life is vastly different to that of Indonesia, renders a sense of dislocation on an Indonesian maid. This sense of dislocation often times propel them to turn to social media to seek religion as a refuge for their loneliness and sense of emptiness. “For many of these women, they usually turn to religion for comfort when they encounter social problem,” said Huda. “And the first place they turn to is social media. These women usually have a shallow knowledge of Islam ... they fall for IS propaganda.” According to Huda, the Indonesian sub-culture where a religious man is seen as a man of high status, it is easy to win their trust. “If you are a religious man, can quote the Koran and hadiths, all of a sudden people will assume you are someone who deserves respect,” said Huda. “The jihadists portray themselves this way ... they put a spell on the girl.” The IS campaign is very effective because they use a simplistic cultural approach, according to Huda. “They tell the girls - the secular system has failed you, corruption is rampant, there is poverty. Our political alternative is the Islamic Caliphate which has been declared. Why don’t you try this new system. That's how they approach the women,” said Huda. To counter IS propaganda, there is a need to include a cultural approach, he suggested. “That is the purpose of my film. I just show the film, to raise awareness, not to lecture anyone,” said Huda. Bahrum Naim, a leading Indonesian IS figure, is behind the man believed to be behind the recruitment of the female suicide bombers, according to Huda. Rizka Nurul, a research officer at Huda’s institute, appears in the film. According to Rizka, apart from money, Indonesian maids are also targeted by IS because they are seen to be “brave.” “It takes courage for these women to leave their villages to travel to a foreign country to work,” said Rizka. According to Rizka, IS recruiters need women who have courage in order for them to carry out a suicide bombing mission. Asked whether the women who are both jailed for wanting to be suicide bomber regret their action, she said no.” In fact, they seem rather proud of what they had done. They are still radical,” said Rizka."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Pro-IS cleric gets death for inspiring terror attacks in Indonesia	"JAKARTA — The South Jakarta District Court has found Friday Aman Abdurrahman guilty of inciting several terror attacks in Indonesia and sentenced the radical cleric to death. “The defendant has been found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of inciting others to commit terrorism,” presiding judge Akhmad Jaini read in the verdict. Aman, the de facto leader of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), a local affiliate of the Islamic State (IS) terror group, had been found responsible for inciting others to commit at least five terror attacks in Indonesia, including the Thamrin shootings and suicide bombings in 2016 on Jl. MH Thamrin in Central Jakarta and the Kampung Melayu bombings in East Jakarta last year. The panel of five judges found his teachings were behind the terror attacks. Aman denied that he was involved in the attack, despite admitting that he had urged his followers to go to Syria to join the IS in its quest to establish a global caliphate. He denounced in his defense plea the recent terror attacks in Indonesia, saying the perpetrators were ignorant and mentally ill. The judges dismissed Aman’s claim, saying based on witnesses’ testimony he had instructed his followers to create chaos and panic in Indonesia as mandated by IS leader Al-Baghdadi."

 Civil group deplores death sentence of terrorist Aman Abdurrahman	"Jakarta-based rights group Community Legal Aid Institute (LBH Masyarakat) has slammed the South Jakarta District Court’s decision to sentence terrorist Aman Abdurrahman to death. The spiritual leader of the Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) terrorist group was declared guilty on Friday for inciting acts of terror. “LBH Masyarakat rejects capital punishment against any crime,” LBH Masyarakat director Ricky Gunawan said in a press statement. He said LBH Masyarakat acknowledged that the attacks committed by Aman Abdurrahman’s terror network were heinous and had taken many lives. “However, the death penalty is not a proper response or answer to [preventing] terror attacks in Indonesia,” Ricky said. Combatting terrorism, Ricky said, required a long-term and holistic approach instead of a reactionary response such as capital punishment. “The death sentence is a delusional solution to terrorism,” the activist said. He pointed to convicted terrorists Amrozi, Imam Samudra and Mukhlas, who were placed in front of the firing squad in 2008, whose execution did not lead to a decline in terrorist activities. LBH Masyarakat recommended that Aman be sentenced to life under continual deradicalization. Aman received the death penalty for violating the 2003 Terrorism Law by orchestrating five terror attacks around Indonesia from 2016 to 2017. Aman founded JAD in February 2015 by uniting Islamic State (IS) sympathizers in Nusakambangan prison as he was serving his nine-year sentence. He is also known as an IS propagandist who actively translates and disseminates IS documents online while indoctrinating fellow prisoners. "	Terrorism	Terrorism

"Surabaya attack: Teen suicide bomber seen crying inconsolably before bombings, says witness"	" SURABAYA: It was still dark when 16-year-old Firman Halim performed his dawn prayers at a mosque near his home in the leafy, middle-class suburb of Rungkut, Surabaya, Indonesia’s second largest city. The bright, happy child was a favourite of the housing complex security guard, 46-year-old Hery, who regarded Firman as his “little brother.” But last Sunday (May 13), something was amiss. The familiar smile was missing. Instead, the teenager was crying. His father, Dita Oepriarto, 46, stroked his head and patted his shoulders but he kept on crying. Hery had come to the mosque to pray before he started his morning shift and he sat close to them. In the stillness of dawn, Hery, overheard his father whispering “be patient, be sincere” but the teenager could not be consoled. He continued crying. “I wanted to ask his father what was the matter but I stopped myself, as I didn’t want to be seen as interfering in people’s affairs,” said Hery. When the prayers ended, Firman, his father and older brother, Yusof Fadhil, 18, got up to make their way home. At that point, Firman saw his friend and for the first time, he neither acknowledged nor smiled at Hery. Firman later climbed onto the back of a motorcycle and his older brother Yusof drove towards the Santa Maria Catholic church. At the entrance, a churchgoer named Aloysius Bayu tried to stop them. A loud blast went off  at 7.30am local time. The two brothers, Aloysius and five other church members were killed. Five minutes later, their father drove a bomb-laden car to the Surabaya Centre Pentecostal Church at 7.35am local time and detonated explosives. Shortly after that, his wife, Puji Kuswati, 42 and her two daughters, Fadhila Sari, 12 and Famela Rizqita, nine, carried out a bomb attack on Diponegoro Indonesian Christian Church. Within 10 minutes, the entire family of six were dead. The suicide bombings at three churches killed 13 people and wounded another 41. HE DID NOT WANT TO DIE A SUICIDE BOMBER: FIRMAN’S FRIEND Back at his home, Hery heard the news. He was stunned. He immediately thought he understood why Firman was crying – he did not  want to die. “I feel, I believe, he didn’t want to do it (die as a suicide bomber). This is not right, to drag children into this,” said Hery, falling silent as he put his head down. The day ended, but not the terror. Later that night at 9.20pm local time, a bomb assembled by Anton Febrianto exploded prematurely in his home in Sidoarjo, just outside of Surabaya. It killed his wife Puspitasari and one child, Hilta Aulia Rahman, 17. Three other children, Ainur Rahman, Faisa Putri and Garida Huda Akbar, respectively aged 15, 11 and 10, survived. On May 14, a family of five, riding on two separate motorcycles, attacked a police station in Surabaya, killing four members of the family. An eight-year-old child survived. All three families knew each other, according to Indonesian police chief Tito Karnavian. Indonesian police said Dita was the head of the Surabaya branch of the pro-Islamic State (IS) Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD). JAD was founded by Aman Abdurrahman, 46, who is Indonesia’s foremost IS ideologue. He is currently on trial for his role in the 2016 Thamrin terror attack in Jakarta. The horror of two families dying as suicide bombers raises the question - how Dita came to be radicalised to a twisted point that he was willing to lead his four children to death? A senior counter-terrorism official told Channel NewsAsia that Dita was an avid follower of Aman Abdurrahman. “He visited Aman several times in prison and has long followed his sermons,” said the official. When asked where did Dita get the idea to turn his children into suicide bombers, the official said: “We don’t know yet but they (Dita and his friends) very often watched suicide bombings carried out by children."" The official added: “As the leader of JAD Surabaya, Dita could have influenced the other two families."" While Indonesian police chief Tito has officially said that Dita and his family did not go to Syria, the actual situation is far more complicated. “We can’t really tell whether he (Dita) went to Syria or not as we have experienced instances where someone went to Syria and slipped back home undetected,” a security source told Channel NewsAsia. Official figures show there are 1,200 returnees from Syria and many of them are not detained owing to the weakness in Indonesia’s anti-terrorism law 15/2003 which does not cover terror acts committed outside of Indonesia. ""Officially, the figure shows 1,200 returnees from Syria. But unofficially, it numbers at least 2,000 or more,” the source said. ""This is a dilemma facing the country."" FAMILY OF SUICIDE BOMBERS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND Indonesian senior counter-terrorism officials and analysts told Channel NewsAsia the suicide bombings comprising an entire family was unprecedented and warned it could spawn similar copy cat bombings. “This family of suicide bombings can be copied by others not only in Indonesia but the rest of the world,” said the senior counter-terrorism official. “I don’t mean to be an alarmist but this (family suicide bombings) is very dangerous to the whole of Southeast Asia and the world. “We are seeing a community that is fine with killing their own kids,” said Huda, who is also a documentary film-maker. According to Huda, children aged 13 have little understanding on what’s going on while those aged above 13 have the ability to comprehend. “Having said that, in a patriarchal society like Indonesia, it is very difficult for a child to escape a father's influence. These children were very helpless,” said Huda. “In this case, it is very clear the father, Dita, is very radical and his wife was influenced by him to go along with him with his suicide bombings. This makes the child very helpless as there is no one to protect them,” said Huda. On Thursday, five days after the blast at Saint Maria Catholic church, the acrid smell of burnt flesh still hung in the air even as life returned to the church and the street that bore witness to the grisly attack. Santa Maria’s parish priest Father Kurdo Irianto was shocked when he learnt that the bombers included two teenagers. “They (teenaged suicide brothers) are victims too. I am not angry,” said Father Kurdo. Father Kurdo exhorted his congregation to forgive the perpetrators. “Forgive the perpetrators ... they are also victims. We need to forgive in order to rebuild a new life. Forgiveness is also the cornerstone of the Catholic faith,” he said. All around the city, banners saying “We are not afraid” flutters in the air in a show of solidarity. Yet taxi drivers were complaining the number of passengers they picked up had fallen since the bombings. “The malls are empty. There are very few people coming out hence the roads are not as jammed as usual. I am really angry and sad at the same time,” said taxi driver Agus before driving into the night."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Tangerang calls for residents to be vigilant amid terror threats	" The Tangerang administration has ordered district heads, subdistrict heads and community and neighborhood unit heads to intensify their monitoring following the arrest of three men suspected of being members of a terrorist group in Tangerang, Banten, on Wednesday. The acting mayor of Tangerang, M. Yusuf, said residents should report suspicious figures to law enforcement officials. He added the administration would launch “Operasi Yustisi” to control the in-flow of newcomers into the city. “We want to limit the movements of terrorists who may be newcomers in the area,” Yusuf said on Thursday, as reported by tempo.co. Tangerang administration spokesman Felix Mulyawan said the residents should be involved in the effort to prevent the dissemination of radical teachings in local neighborhoods. “At the least, residents could be more aware of their surroundings and follow the mandatory reporting for newcomers,” Felix said.

"Alleged Tangerang terrorist always neat and well behaved, say neighbors"	"Muhammad Choir, 32, the man the National Police’s Densus 88 counterterrorism squad arrested on Wednesday for his alleged involvement in a terror group, always looked neat and relaxed in public, a neighbor has said. The neighbor, who identified herself only as Vera, said that Muhammad often took a morning walk around their neighborhood on Jl. Gempol Raya, Tangerang, wearing a T-shirt and shorts. It was only on Friday that Muhammad, who had a thin beard, wore a loose tunic or gamis. According to the tempo.co report, Vera said she knew Muhammad as a tailor who made school uniforms, sports attire and Islamic dress. “He received a lot of orders, especially for early childhood school [PAUD] uniforms. His customers were mostly women,” Vera said on Wednesday as quoted by tempo.co. Another neighbor, Midah, 43, said Muhammad was a nice neighbor that he called “Om Choir”, or ""Uncle Choir"". “When he went back to his hometown in Medan, he bought me coffee as a gift. When he went to Sukabumi, Om Choir brought me mochi,” she said. Sukabumi is the hometown of Choir’s wife, whom he married three months ago. Choir lived in a rental house for about a year, paying annual rent of about Rp 10 million (US$710.64). Choir only had one employee, identified only as G, who was nicknamed Ujang and also arrested on Wednesday. “I don’t know their real names. I called them Om Choir, Ujang and Teteh (a common Sundanese title meaning ""elder sister"") for [Choir’s] wife,” said Midah. On Wednesday, Densus 88 personnel raided several locations on Jl. Gempol in Pinang and on Jl. Kunciran Indah, which is located about 1 kilometer from Jl. Gempol. They arrested Muhammad, G and another man identified as A who were allegedly involved in a terrorist group. Muhammad’s wife was also detained as a witness. National Police spokesperson Insp. Gen.

"Destroy and kill terrorists, Duterte orders military"	"President Rodrigo Duterte has ordered the military to “destroy and kill” the extremist and terrorist groups in the country and assured them of his full support. “I assure you that you have my full support as you conduct intensive military operations against these terrorist groups, particularly those who subscribe to the extremist ideologies of the Islamic State and Al Qaida,” Duterte said Saturday in his speech in Jolo. “That’s just a bankrupt, a useless ideology,” Duterte told soldiers in Camp Teodulfo Bautista.  “They only know how to kill and destroy. Destroy and kill. So my order to you: Destroy and kill also. Why would you want to be at a disadvantage?”  Duterte acknowledged the presence of the soldiers as they honored the sacrifices of the 22 troopers who were wounded in an encounter in Patikul. “We are grateful for your heroism and I will personally ensure that you will be taken care of as you recover from your injuries,” said Duterte, adding he would take care of their families. “I said to give my fullest attention and all the things you need, from the time you enter the service up to the time [you finish it], I have plans already.” Duterte said he believed that the troops remained determined to carry on with their mission despite the challenges they faced. “Every time you need me and everything that you need to survive, I will provide,” Duterte said.He ordered the soldiers to end their lives when cornered. “I’m the only President who gave sidearms because the warfare here is really terrible,” he said. “Do not give in that they will take your arms alive. If you get cornered and you run out of bullets, do not surrender. They will only bring you to their camp, treat you like a dog, bring you in front of a camera and then slit your throat. “This I tell you: Don’t let yourselves be treated like pigs. My soldiers are courageous and ready to die. So, when you run out of bullets, take the last magazine and eat it instead.” Duterte said he would do the same, and that if his airplane crashed into enemy territory he would not be caught alive.  He thanked the soldiers for their dedication, resilience, and support. “With your bravery, selflessness and patriotism, I am optimistic that we will one day defeat all threats to our democratic institutions and secure a brighter future for our beloved country,” he said."

UN advisor a target living as a 'terrorist'	" VICKY Tauli-Corpuz has spent four decades campaigning for indigenous people in her native Philippines, but never feared for her life. That changed last month when she was branded a “terrorist” by President Rodrigo Duterte’s administration. The special advisor to the UN on indigenous rights since 2014 was among 600 people accused of terrorism over their alleged links to Maoist rebels in a government document filed in a Manila court in February. The activist, who had condemned alleged rights abuses in the southern Mindanao region where the state is battling an Islamic insurgency and leftist guerrillas, denies the allegations and says she feels like a marked woman. “This is like a target list basically,” the slightly built, bespectacled 65-year-old from the Kankanaey Igorot ethnic group said in an interview at the UN cultural body Unesco in Paris. While waiting to see if the state brings charges, she said she has decided to stay out of the Philippines on the advice of her lawyers. Tauli-Corpuz is one of several left-wing activists accused by Duterte’s government of links to the communist rebels with whom he broke off talks last year, after initially saying he would “walk the extra mile” for peace. Duterte blamed the rebels, whose insurgency has claimed an estimated 30,000 lives since 1969, for ongoing attacks on the security forces. In its court petition, the Justice department asked for the Communist Party of the Philippines and its armed wing, the New People’s Army, to be declared “terrorist organizations.” Attached to the submission were 600 names of suspected rebels, including Tauli-Corpuz and two other prominent indigenous leaders—Joan Carling and Jose Molintas—who have previously advised the United Nations. The targeting of the trio came after Duterte last year accused indigenous Lumad schools of grooming children to become insurgents and threatened to bomb them. Reacting to the case, UN rights chief Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein said it was “unacceptable for a special rapporteur acting on behalf of the international community whose expertise is sought by the [UN]Human Rights Council to be treated in this way.” New York-based Human Rights Watch said those on the “virtual government hit list” were “at grave risk.” Tauli-Corpuz, who began campaigning for indigenous rights in her native Cordillera region during the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, compared the government list to the lists of suspects used to prosecute Duterte’s deadly anti-drugs war. Police say they have killed more than 4,000 drug suspects who resisted arrest, but rights groups estimate there have been more than three times that, including people murdered by vigilante groups.“The President has his police and his death squads who can easily kill people whom they accuse of being terrorists,” Tauli-Corpuz said. The activist who helped draft the seminal 2007 UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples said she believed she was targeted over her condemnation in December of alleged rights abuses in Mindanao, where Duterte is battling pro-Islamic State gunmen. “They [indigenous people] are being displaced, they are being killed, their lands are being taken over, so I made a statement. which came out in the newspapers and the government immediately came out and said I was embarrassing the government internationally,” she said. Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano has insisted there is evidence linking Tauli-Corpuz to the rebels and said she and others on the list “should see this as an opportunity to clear their names.” Duterte, who enjoys wide popularity despite his rights record, has repeatedly lashed out at his domestic and foreign critics. Last week, he announced he was pulling the Philippines out of the International Criminal Court, which is examining his crackdown on drugs. He also recently vowed not to cooperate with the UN special rapporteur on extra-judicial killings, Agnes Callamard. “You’re investigating us, fact finding? Well sorry, do not fuck with me,” he said, in remarks aimed at Callamard. In a statement released to the press, former lawmaker and journalist Satur Ocampo dismissed as “defective and baseless” the government’s bid to declare him a terrorist. In a motion filed before the Regional Trial Court of Manila Branch 19, lawyers for Ocampo asked that the Justice Department petition be dismissed. “In the case of Satur Ocampo, the bases for his inclusion in the list are affidavits executed in 2006. The DOJ merely recycled the affidavits that they used unsuccessfully against him in the rebellion case during the time of President [Gloria] Arroyo. In any case, the affidavits pertain to incidents before the passage of the Human Security Act. This violates a very basic rule that we all learned in our first year in law school: that laws shall have prospective application,” a lawyer for Ocampo said. Also on Friday, the environmental organization Greenpeace called for the court to junk the government’s list that seeks to label 600 individuals as terrorists, saying that the move is careless and puts the lives of innocent people in grave danger. “We are gravely alarmed over such moves that target, harass, and criminalize individuals and organizations that legitimately work to protect human rights, including those who seek to protect our rights to enjoy the blessings of nature, to a stable climate and to a healthy environment,” said Yeb Saño, executive director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia. “The tagging of activists and environmental and human rights defenders is being used by those in power to make sure that the exploitation of the people and of our environment goes on unabated.”"	Terrorism	Terrorism
Funerals next week for Belgian policewomen killed by terrorist	"BRUSSELS (AFP) - The funerals of two murdered police women will be held next Tuesday (June 5) in Belgium's eastern city of Liege where a suspected terrorist killed them and a student, officials said. Funeral ceremonies will be held at 10:00 am (0800 GMT) for Lucile Garcia and Soraya Belkacemi, who will be cremated shortly afterward among family and friends, city officials said. Garcia, 54, had recently become a grandmother, while Soraya Belkacemi, 44, was a mother to 13-year-old twins. Cyril Vangriecken, 22, shot dead in the passenger seat of a parked car, will be buried on Monday, city police spokeswoman Jadranka Lozina told AFP without elaborating. His bowls club will organise a march in his honour on Sunday, Lozinka said. The Islamic State group claimed one of its ""soldiers"" killed the three people, the jihadists' Amaq propaganda agency said. ISIS said ""he led the attack in response to calls to target the countries of the US-led international coalition,"" which is fighting the jihadist group mainly in Syria. Belgian investigators said the attacker identified as Benjamin Herman repeatedly stabbed the policewomen in Liege on Tuesday before using their own firearms to kill them. The 31-year-old then shot dead a student sitting in a parked car in the centre of the industrial city, before entering a nearby school where he briefly took a female cleaner hostage. In a separate investigation, police also suspect that Herman had killed a drug dealer just hours after getting temporary release from prison on Monday morning. Belgian police have identified Herman as a drifter who spent a decade in and out of prison for acts of violence and petty crimes. Prosecutors said his method of attack was a known ""modus operandi"" of ISIS, which claimed deadly attacks in Brussels in 2016. Amateur footage obtained by AFP showed the gunman shouting ""Allahu akbar"" (Arabic for ""God is greatest"") as he walked through the streets during the rampage."	Terrorism	Terrorism
 London attack accused hoped to kill Corbyn	"LONDON, Jan 31 — A man accused of deliberately driving a van into a group of London Muslims told his trial yesterday that he wanted to kill the British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn. Darren Osborne said killing the leftist Labour leader would have been “one less terrorist off our streets”, while killing Labour London Mayor Sadiq Khan as well “would have been like winning the lottery”. Osborne is accused of murdering 51-year-old Makram Ali and trying to kill others in the Finsbury Park area of north London on June 19 last year, after growing angry at recent terror attacks and child sexual exploitation scandals involving gangs of mainly Muslim men, the trial has heard. Osborne, 48, from the Welsh capital Cardiff, denies the charges. He is accused of deliberately driving a van at a group of Muslims who had been attending Ramadan prayers at local mosques. Taking the stand at Woolwich Crown Court in southeast London, Osborne claimed he had plotted with two men called Terry Jones and Dave to “plough through as many” people as possible at a pro-Palestinian march. Corbyn was believed to be attending the central London event but was not there, and road closures meant there was no way for the vehicle to get close to marchers, Osborne said. Prosecutor Jonathan Rees asked him: “Were you hoping that you would have an opportunity to attack Jeremy Corbyn and kill him?” Osborne replied: “Oh yeah”, adding: “It would be one less terrorist off our streets. “If Sadiq Khan had been there it would have been even better. It would have been like winning the lottery.” Osborne claimed that at the time of the collision in the Finsbury Park area, Dave was driving, and carried out the “spontaneous” attack. Both prosecutor and defendant agreed it was “remarkable” that Dave had managed to escape the scene of the attack. Rees said Dave and Terry were “totally fabricated” by Osborne in order to deflect responsibility away from himself. In his opening statement, Rees told jurors that Osborne was “obsessed” with Muslims and deliberately drove into a group near a mosque in what amounted to an act of terrorism. At its opening on January 22, the trial was set to last two weeks."	Terrorism	Terrorism

"Terror suspect killed in fresh gunfire in Indonesia's Surabaya, 4 arrested in anti-terror ops"	"JAKARTA/SURABAYA (XINHUA, THE JAKARTA POST/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - A terror suspect was killed in a gunfire exchange with the Indonesian police anti-terror squad during crackdown operations following after a series of suicide bomb attacks in the city of Surabaya on Tuesday (May 15). ""A fire exchange has occurred, claiming one life aged between 39 and 41,"" Frans Barung Mangera, the spokesman for the police headquarters in East Java province, where Surabaya is located, said. Further details on the terror suspect would be released after an examination by the police's Disaster Victim Identification Unit was done, Frans said. The gunfire was part of a series of anti-terror crackdown operations in the aftermath of the attacks which took place on three churches and a police station Sunday and Monday in Surabaya. At least five explosions occurred in Surabaya and Sidoarjo on Sunday and Monday, killing a total of 25 people, including 13 suicide bombers, who were members of three families. The bombings marked a new terror surge in Indonesia as attackers are now operated by an entire family, including even children. Meanwhile the police's Densus 88 counter-terrorism squad arrested another four suspected terrorists in different cities in East Java during Monday night operations, police said on Tuesday. Two suspected terrorists were arrested in Malang regency, one in Pandaan and one in Surabaya, Frans told a press conference. Police have not released the names of the newly arrested suspected terrorists but said they were connected to the perpetrators in the Surabaya attacks, including the family of Dita Oeprianto, who blew themselves up at three churches in the provincial capital on Sunday. The police announced on Monday they arrested nine terrorists in different places following the Surabaya attacks. ""That means we have arrested a total of 13 people so far and (the number is likely) to increase. They are not including those who were shot dead,"" Frans said. East Java police chief Machfud Arifin said in the morning that individuals that were being hunted down included radical preachers in the religious gatherings frequented by the suicide bombing families. National police chief Tito Karnavian previously said the perpetrators of the attacks were connected to Jamaah Ansharud Daulah (JAD), a local terrorist group affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria militant group."

Seven killed in IS attack on bus carrying Egyptian Christians	" MINYA (Egypt), Nov 3 ? Gunmen attacked a bus carrying Coptic Christians in central Egypt yesterday, killing seven in the latest assault on the religious minority claimed by the Islamic State group. The attackers opened fire on the bus of pilgrims in Minya province after the occupants had visited the Saint Samuel monastery, the local bishop told AFP. Bishop Makarios of Minya said the wounded were taken to a hospital in Beni Mazar, around 200 kilometres (120 miles) south of Cairo. The Coptic Church in a statement released the names of the seven “martyrs” ? including two women ? who died in the attack. Heavy deployments of security forces blocked roads leading towards the scene of the shooting, an AFP reporter said. A security source confirmed that seven people were killed in the attack and said seven were wounded. The Islamic State group claimed the attack in a message via its propaganda agency Amaq. “Those who carried out the ambush... in Minya are fighters of the Islamic State,” it said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app. Egyptian state television said security forces were on Friday afternoon still in pursuit of the attackers. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi observed a minute of silence at a youth forum he was attending and called Coptic Pope Tawadros II to offer his condolences. “I am mourning with deep sadness the martyrs who fell today at the hands of traitors who are trying to harm the tightly-knit fabric of the nation,” the president said in a statement released on Twitter. “I wish the wounded a quick recovery and confirm our determination to continue our efforts to fight the darkness of terrorism and pursue the criminals.” Egypt's prosecutors office said it had received reports of “gunfire targeting a bus carrying a group of Copts returning from the Monastery of Saint Samuel the Confessor”. The health minister and minister of social solidarity were dispatched by Sisi to Minya. Copts, a Christian minority that make up 10 percent of Egypt's 96 million people, have in recent years been repeatedly targeted by the Islamic State jihadist group. IS killed more than 40 people in twin church bombings in April 2017 and a month later shot dead 28 Christians in Minya province. Egypt's government imposed a three-month countrywide state of emergency after the April 2017 church bombings. In December 2017 an IS gunman killed nine people in an attack on a church in a south Cairo suburb. A year earlier, an IS suicide bomber killed almost 30 worshippers at a church in Cairo located in the Saint Mark's Cathedral complex, the seat of the Coptic papacy. The Egyptian army launched a major offensive in February 2018 against IS in the Sinai Peninsula, where the group has waged a deadly insurgency since the fall of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013. Alongside attacks against Copts, the jihadists have killed hundreds of soldiers and policemen in Egypt in recent years and were allegedly behind a November 2017 attack against a mosque in north Sinai that killed more than 300 people. The military offensive ? Dubbed “Sinai 2018” ? has killed more than 450 jihadists, according to an army estimate, while around 30 Egyptian soldiers have been killed during this year's operation. Egyptian authorities have also convicted jihadists for their role in attacks against Copts. Last month an Egyptian military court sentenced 17 people to death over the suicide attacks against churches in 2016 and 2017. Copts have long complained of discrimination in Egypt and IS is not the only group to have launched sectarian attacks against the community. In December 2017, hundreds of Muslims attacked a church south of Cairo that had been operating without a permit for more than a dozen years."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Gunmen attack headquarters of Libya's state oil firm, two staff killed"	"related media assets (image or videos) available. Click to see the gallery. 7 related media assets (image or videos) available. Click to see the gallery. Several armed men attacked the headquarters of Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) in the capital Tripoli on Monday, killing at least two staff members, a security official said. TRIPOLI: Several armed men attacked the headquarters of Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) in the capital Tripoli on Monday, killing at least two staff members, a security official said. In the first attack of its kind against the top managers of Libya's state oil industry, two of the gunmen were also killed and at least 10 NOC staff wounded, officials said. Security forces said they had regained control of the landmark glass-fronted building in the centre of the city. The attack came less than a week after a fragile truce halted fierce clashes between rival armed groups in Tripoli, the latest eruption of violence in Libya, which has been in turmoil since a 2011 uprising toppled Muammar Gaddafi. Armed groups regularly block oilfields to make demands but the NOC headquarters had so far been spared the violence. The NOC provides the vast bulk of Libya's state income and, along with the Tripoli-based central bank, is one of the only state institutions still functioning well amid chaos. No group immediately claimed responsibility for Monday's attack. But the interior ministry said in a statement initial indications showed the gunmen belonged to Islamic State, which has previously carried out attacks in Tripoli and other Libyan towns and cities. Gunfire rang out in the morning as security forces allied to the Tripoli-based government arrived. ""The death toll so far is two killed from NOC staff and two attackers,"" said Ahmad Ben Salim, spokesman for the Special Deterrence Force (Rada), one of the most powerful factions in Tripoli. Security forces smashed windows so staff could escape and several people were hurt by shattered glass, witnesses said. NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla and his office manager were seen safely leaving the building. Libya has been divided between rival governments and military factions based in the east and west of the country since 2014, causing political deadlock and an economic crisis. However, the NOC has continued to function relatively normally across Libya, which relies on oil exports for most of its income. Oil production has been hit by attacks on oil facilities and blockades, though last year it partially recovered to around one million barrels per day. Islamist militants have sleeper cells in northern cities as well as mobile units in Libya's southern desert, according to Libyan and Western officials. In May, Islamic State claimed responsibility for a deadly attack on the national election commission offices in Tripoli. The group also claimed an attack in 2015 on the Corinthia hotel, a landmark location in Tripoli. The NOC attack came a day after the United Nations said major armed factions had agreed to freeze their positions to extend the ceasefire."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"At least 6 dead as blasts, gunfire rock Afghan city"	" JALALABAD, Afghanistan (AFP) - At least six civilians were killed when militants detonated bombs and stormed a government building on Sunday (May 13) in an ongoing assault in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad, officials said. There were two explosions near the city's directorate of finance, the Nangarhar provincial governor's spokesman Attaullah Khogyani told AFP, adding that ""a number of attackers"" had entered the building. ""Security forces are in the area chasing and fighting them,"" he said. ""So far six civilians (have been) killed and 33 wounded. One attacker is also down. The clearing operation is ongoing."" Earlier, health department officials in the city said hospitals had received at least four dead bodies and 20 wounded people. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. Jalalabad is the capital of restive Nangarhar, which borders Pakistan. Some areas of the province are a stronghold of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group but Taleban fighters are also active there. It was the latest deadly violence to strike Afghanistan as militant groups step up attacks and US-backed Afghan forces intensify air strikes and ground offensives. The assault comes days after suicide bombers and gunmen launched apparently coordinated attacks on two Kabul police stations on Wednesday, killing at least 10 people. April saw a series of attacks across the country targeting voter registration centres as the country gears up for long-delayed legislative elections due in October. The Taleban and ISIS have made clear their intentions to disrupt the elections. Officials are concerned that a low voter turnout will undermine the credibility of the poll. The Taleban recently launched their annual spring offensive, in an apparent rejection of a peace talks overture by the Afghan government. Their Operation Al Khandaq will target US forces and ""their intelligence agents"" as well as their ""internal supporters"", a Taleban statement said on April 25. But the ISIS group has also stepped up its attacks in recent months, particularly in Kabul. Nine journalists, including AFP's chief photographer in Kabul Shah Marai, were among the 25 people killed in a double suicide blast claimed by ISIS in the capital on April 30. Kabul has become one of the deadliest places in the country for civilians as security forces struggle to keep the militants at bay following the withdrawal of Nato combat forces at the end of 2014."

"Car bombs in Yemen’s Aden kill 6, wound dozens"	"SANAA, Yemen — Two car bomb explosions killed at least six people and wounded 43 others including civilians on Saturday in Yemen’s southern city of Aden, security officials and witnesses said, in an attack later claimed by the extremist Islamic State group. The explosions targeted the site of an anti-terrorism military camp with detention facilities for suspected militants, the officials said, adding that those killed included three civilians and three security personnel. They said that the casualties were taken to hospitals for treatment. The Islamic State’s statement, carried by its Aamaq news agency, said two suicide bomb attacks had struck the anti-terrorism camp in Aden. “The explosions terrified dozens of families living in the area who rushed to the street to look for their children,” eyewitness Gamal Mahdi told The Associated Press. He added that the explosions resulted in multiple causalities, including civilians, and were followed by heavy gunfire. Ali al-Saya, a member of the separatist Southern Transitional Council, told the Associated Press that one of the explosions targeted an office at the STC, which is also the residence of Aden’s former governor Aidrous al-Zubaidi. The office is situated close to the anti-terrorism camp. Al-Zubaidi was not present when the bomb went off. Other witnesses said that militants tried to storm the camp before the explosion but failed. Photos surfaced following the explosion showing the charred vehicles and clouds of heavy smoke hovering over the area."	Terrorism	Terrorism
At least seven killed in suicide attack on Kabul commemorations	"KABUL, Sept 9 — A suicide bomber on a motorbike blew himself up near a convoy of gunmen commemorating the death anniversary of a famed resistance leader in Kabul today, killing at least seven people, officials said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the latest deadly attack in the Afghan capital that comes days after a double bombing at a wrestling club killed at least 26 people. At least seven people were killed and 24 wounded in the explosion, the interior ministry said in a statement. All the casualties were civilians. The force of the blast shattered windows and shook nearby buildings. Among the dead was the driver of a car taking part in the commemorations. He veered off the road and into the front of a shop when the blast happened, witnesses told AFP. Two of his passengers were wounded, they said. Afghan security forces said earlier they had shot dead a man who had been planning to blow himself up near supporters of Ahmad Shah Massoud. The Tajik commander led resistance to the Soviet occupation in the 1980s and to the 1996-2001 Taliban regime. The attack came as convoys of gun-wielding men terrorised Kabul as they commemorated the 17th anniversary of Massoud’s death. Massoud was killed two days before the 9/11 attacks in New York and Washington that precipitated the US-led invasion of Afghanistan. Dozens of cars and pickups carrying men armed with heavy weapons and waving flags drove around the city, blaring loud sirens. AFP journalists heard frequent bursts of gunfire. At least 13 people were wounded by falling bullets and taken to hospital, health ministry spokesman Waheed Majroh told journalists. Police arrested 110 people and seized 20 cars and 10 weapons, the interior ministry said, as part of a crackdown on the violent commemorations. Elsewhere, nearly 20 members of the Afghan security forces were killed in fighting overnight, adding to the hundreds of people killed in recent weeks. Ten police officers were killed and eight wounded during an hours-long gunbattle with Taliban fighters in Wardak province, near Kabul, provincial governor spokesman Abdul Rahman Mangal told AFP. “Air strikes were called in and over 50 Taliban fighters were killed” in the fighting in Daimirdad district, Mangal added. On the other side of the country, Taliban fighters attacked a checkpoint in Obe district in Herat province, killing nine members of the security forces, provincial governor spokesman Jailani Farhad told AFP. Five others were wounded in the attack that ended when government-backed reinforcements were sent to the scene, Farhad said, adding that 15 insurgents were killed. The bloodshed comes amid a flurry of diplomatic efforts to convince the Taliban, Afghanistan’s largest militant group, to agree to negotiate an end to the war. The smaller but potent Islamic State (IS) group is not part of the process, with the United States vowing to annihilate its fighters in Afghanistan. But today’s blatant lawlessness in the capital and the limited response from security forces further undermined confidence in authorities. In a firestorm of angry posts on social media, war-weary Afghans expressed their frustration with the constant violence and the government’s inability to protect civilians. “Why do people have to endure this every year on Sept 9th? Why is the #Afghan govt allowing this?” one social media user posted on Twitter. “Where is rule of law?” tweeted another. A double bombing at a wrestling club in a heavily Shiah neighbourhood on Wednesday killed at least 26 people, including two journalists, and wounded 91. IS claimed responsibility for the attack. The extremist group considers Shiah Muslims apostates and has ramped up attacks against the minority community in recent years. The last major IS-claimed attack on Shiahs in Kabul was on August 15 when a suicide bomber blew himself up in an education centre, killing dozens of students."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Two dead in militant attack on Afghan government office	" JALALABAD, July 11 — Gunmen stormed an education department compound in Afghanistan’s restive east today and were battling security forces in an ongoing attack that has left at least two people dead, officials said. Five others have been wounded in the second attack in Jalalabad city in as many days and a number of employees were trapped inside the building, Nangarhar provincial governor spokesman Attaullah Khogyani told AFP. Security forces were trying to clear the militants from the compound and rescue the workers. It was not clear how many gunmen or employees were inside. A security guard employed by the department was among the dead, Khogyani said. Jalalabad health director Najibullah Kamawal confirmed five wounded people had been brought to hospital so far. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the raid. Nangarhar’s provincial capital has seen an uptick in violence in recent weeks, with the Islamic State group claiming most of the attacks. Yesterday, a suicide attack in the city killed at least 12 people and ignited a nearby petrol station, with witnesses describing screaming victims “swallowed” by flames. The bomber was targeting Afghan security forces when he blew himself up. Ten civilians were among the dead. IS claimed that attack via its Amaq propaganda agency. The group has claimed a series of high-casualty suicide bomb attacks in the province in recent weeks, as US and Afghan forces continue offensive operations against the group. While the Taliban is Afghanistan’s largest militant group, IS has a relatively small but potent presence, mainly in the north and east of the country. Today’s attack comes a day after President Ashraf Ghani flew to Brussels to attend a Nato summit where he will be hoping to get a greater commitment from members to the nearly 17-year conflict. Currently, there are about 14,000 US troops in Afghanistan, providing the main component of the Nato mission there to support and train local forces. The attack also coincides with the start of a university entrance exam for more than 16,000 students in Jalalabad, but it was not clear if the two events were linked. The attack comes exactly a month after militants raided the education department in the city. In that incident a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance to the department, triggering a fierce battle between gunmen and security forces. At least 10 people were wounded after terrified employees jumped out of the windows. A recent ceasefire between Afghan security forces and the Taliban during the Islamic holiday Eid had raised hopes that an end to hostilities in the war-weary country was possible. Since then, however, the Taliban has returned to the battlefield and IS, which was not involved in the truce, has continued to carry out deadly attacks. Nangarhar borders Pakistan, which has been under growing US pressure to crack down on extremist groups operating in the country. Pakistan has long been accused of supporting the Afghan Taliban and providing safe haven to its leaders, charges Islamabad denies. Pakistan, in return, has accused Afghanistan of sheltering the Pakistani Taliban."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Belgium mourns victims of bloody Liege attack	"LIEGE, May 31 — Belgium yesterday paid emotional tribute to two policewomen and a student shot dead in the eastern city of Liege as investigators probed the gunman’s transition from years of petty criminality to “terrorist murder”. Prosecutors confirmed they were treating Tuesday’s bloodshed as an act of terrorism, saying the shooter Benjamin Herman was also suspected of another murder the night before. The Islamic State group claimed one of its “soldiers” was behind the attack, the jihadists’ Amaq propaganda agency said yesterday. Across Belgium, flags were flying at half-mast as Prime Minister Charles Michel led a minute’s silence in Liege where around 1,000 people had gathered to pay their respects, among them many police officers. Belgium’s national football squad also halted a training session ahead of next month’s World Cup to observe a minute’s silence for the victims. As police scrambled to unpick the gunman’s motive for the attack, a dramatic account emerged of Tuesday’s bloodshed, which began when the 31-year-old attacked two policewomen with a knife. After repeatedly stabbing the policewomen, he grabbed their weapons and killed them in a modus operandi which has been encouraged online by extremists from the Islamic State group. The two victims were identified as Lucile Garcia, 54, who had recently become a grandmother, and Soraya Belkacemi, 44, a mother to 13-year-old twins. He then shot dead a 22-year-old student sitting in a parked car in the city centre before entering a nearby school where he briefly took a female cleaner hostage. Speaking to the Derniere Heure newspaper, the cleaner, who gave her name only as Darifa, said he had asked her whether she was Muslim and if she was fasting for Ramadan. When she answered “yes” to both questions, Herman said he would not harm her. She then urged him to give himself up, telling him: “You shouldn’t be here, this is a school, there are children!” after which he burst out for his final confrontation with police. Investigators are trying to understand how Herman, a drifter who spent a decade in and out of prison for violence and drug offences, came to carry out such a bloody attack. “The facts are qualified as terrorist murder and attempted terrorist murder,” prosecutors’ spokesman Eric Van Der Sypt told a news briefing in Brussels. He pointed to the fact that “the perpetrator shouted several times ‘Allahu akbar’... and information from state security according to which the perpetrator was in touch with radicalised persons.” But he said information about Herman’s contacts with extremists dated “from late 2016, early 2017” and had not been confirmed since. Amateur footage obtained by AFP showed the gunman shouting Allahu akbar — “God is greatest” — as he walked through the streets. In another video, Herman darts out of the school before a short and intense burst of police gunfire, after which he collapses on the ground. “There are signals that there was radicalisation in the prison but did this radicalisation lead to these actions? There, too, we can ask ourselves a lot of questions,” he told RTL radio. Investigators are also examining whether Herman acted alone or had accomplices. Investigators are paying special attention to the gruesome killing of an alleged heroin dealer linked to Herman who was battered to death with a hammer late Monday in a village near the Luxembourg border. They found the hammer in Herman’s car on Tuesday. Jambon said police believed he had carried out the killing just hours after getting temporary release from prison on Monday morning. Liege, a major city in Belgium’s blighted industrial rustbelt, was the scene of another bloody shootout in 2011 when another former convict killed six people and wounded more than 120 before turning the gun on himself. Belgium has been on alert since January 2015 when authorities smashed a terror cell near Liege that was planning an attack on police. That cells had links to Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the mastermind of the November 2015 attacks on Paris that killed 130 people and was claimed by IS. "	Terrorism	Terrorism
Egypt court puts government critic on terror list	"CAIRO, Feb 21 — An Egyptian court yesterday put a leading government critic and 15 others on terror lists at the request of the public prosecutor, a judicial official said. Abdel Moneim Abul Fotouh, who is accused of joining an illegally formed group and spreading false news in Egypt that could harm its interests, is to remain on the list for five years, the official said. He was arrested on Wednesday after joining a call to boycott next month’s presidential election, which incumbent Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is expected win easily after most rivals were sidelined or withdrew. The identity of the 15 others put on the terror lists were unknown. On Thursday, prosecutors ordered Abul Fotouh be remanded for 15 days over alleged links to exiled members of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. The interior ministry accused Abul Fotouh, a former leading member of the Brotherhood and candidate in the 2012 presidential election, of having been in contact with the group’s members in exile “to sow trouble and instability”. Abul Fotouh was detained shortly after he arrived from London where he gave interviews in which he was critical of the Egyptian government. Sisi was elected in 2014, a year after the former army chief ousted his Islamist predecessor Muhammad Mursi. Abul Fotouh had supported mass protests against the Islamist that prompted the military to topple him. He has since been critical of Sisi who has been accused of clamping down on dissent."

Anger in Nigeria over Boko Haram ‘abduction’ response	"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Feb 23 — Anger erupted in a town in remote northeast Nigeria yesterday after officials fumbled to account for scores of schoolgirls who locals say have been kidnapped by Boko Haram jihadists — a disappearance reviving traumatic memories of the abducted Chibok schoolgirls. Police said on Wednesday that 111 girls from the state-run boarding school in Dapchi, in Yobe state, were unaccounted for following a jihadist raid on Monday night. Hours later, Abdullahi Bego, spokesman for Yobe state governor Ibrahim Gaidam, said “some of the girls” had been rescued by troops “from the terrorists who abducted them”. But on a visit to Dapchi yesterday, Gaidam appeared to question whether there had been any abduction. “The girls scattered during the attack, and we can’t be sure whether they were lost or taken,” he said. “We have no certainty that these boys (Boko Haram) took these girls. “Nobody saw these girls being taken in vehicles. It is possible some of the girls came across motorists and they gave them a ride to some places.” As news of his comments spread, groups of angry youths set up barricades and burned car tyres in the streets, hurling missiles at the governor’s convoy. Bego’s statement had been the first official acknowledgement of an abduction, two days after Boko Haram fighters stormed the remote town in pick-up trucks and a lorry. The disappearance sparked fears of a repeat of the 2014 mass kidnapping of more than 200 girls from a similar school in Chibok, in neighbouring Borno state. Initially, the students in Dapchi were reported to have fled with their teachers at the sound of gunfire. Families claimed the authorities tried to cover up the abduction. A federal government delegation spent less than an hour on the ground at the school meeting Gaidam and military commanders before leaving by helicopter. Information Minister Lai Mohammed made no direct comment on Gaidam’s remarks, but said some students “have phoned from their hiding places... (and) other locations”. He told reporters: “As things develop we will let you know. But we cannot categorically say, ‘x number of girls have been abducted’. But we can say that not all have returned.” Inuwa Mohammed, whose 16-year-old daughter, Falmata, was missing, said he was “devastated by this twist of events” and that his wife fainted on hearing the news and was in hospital. “I woke up with the strong hope of meeting my daughter and my wife had been making preparations for a warm welcome, only for us to receive this shattering news that all along the story has been a rumour,” he added. The attack will again raise questions about the government’s grip on security in remote northeast Nigeria, after nearly nine years of fighting and at least 20,000 deaths. US State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Boko Haram’s “choice of targets including schools, markets and places of worship reflect the brutality of terror organizations.” Residents said fighters dressed in military fatigues and turbans arrived unchallenged, firing weapons and shouting “Allahu Akbar” (“God is greatest”). Safai Maimagani, a herbal medicine vendor, said the militants headed towards the school on the edge of the sleepy farming community. When they returned, “I heard shrieks of girls from the lorry,” he said. Muhammad Kabo, a tea seller, gave a similar account: “They were here for less than an hour. I heard girls wailing in the truck and it was clear that they abducted some girls from the school.” A school security guard who gave his name as Baa-Koro said the gunmen tried to stop the girls from fleeing and tricked them into believing they had come to rescue them. “Some of the girls believed them and climbed up into the lorry. Many others just kept running,” he added. President Muhammadu Buhari was elected in 2015 on a promise to defeat the Islamic State group affiliate and has repeatedly maintained they are now a spent force. But civilians — especially those displaced by the conflict — remain vulnerable to suicide attacks and hit-and-run raids. The Dapchi attack also calls into question how far pledges to improve security at schools have been implemented nearly four years after the Chibok abduction. Since May last year, 107 of the 219 held since 2014 have either escaped or been released as part of a government-brokered deal. Security analysts suggested government ransom payments to secure the release of the Chibok girls could have given the under-pressure group an incentive for financing. "	Terrorism	Terrorism
Gunmen kill 12 Revolutionary Guards in attack on Iran military parade	"DUBAI, Sept 22 ? Gunmen fired on a military parade in southwestern Iran today, killing 12 members of the Revolutionary Guards, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported, in one of the worst attacks ever on the elite force. State television said the assault, which wounded more than 60 people, targeted a stand where Iranian officials had gathered to watch an annual event marking the start of the Islamic Republic’s 1980-88 war with Iraq. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) have been the sword and shield of Shi’ite clerical rule since Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. The Guards also play a major role in Iran’s regional interests in countries such as Iraq, Syria and Yemen. A video distributed to Iranian media showed soldiers crawling on the ground as gunfire blazed in their direction. One soldier picked up a gun and got to his feet as women and children fled for their lives. Ali Hosein Hoseinzadeh, deputy governor in Khuzestan province, was quoted as saying the death toll was expected to rise. One of those killed was a journalist. The bloodshed struck a blow to security in Opec oil producer Iran, which has been relatively stable compared with neighbouring Arab countries that have grappled with upheaval since the 2011 uprisings across the Middle East. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack in the city of Ahvaz. State television blamed “takfiri elements”, a reference to Sunni Muslim militants, for the attack. Ahvaz is in the centre of Khuzestan province, where there have been sporadic protests by the Arab minority in predominantly Shi’ite Iran. Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif said the assault was the handiwork of “regional terror sponsors”, language that usually refers to Iran’s enemies Saudi Arabia and Israel, and “their US masters”. He vowed Tehran would respond decisively. ISNA said an unnamed spokesman for the Revolutionary Guards blamed Arab nationalists backed by Saudi Arabia for the attack. The Revolutionary Guards are the most powerful and heavily armed military force in the Islamic Republic and also have a vast stake worth billions of dollars in the economy. Kurdish militants killed 10 Revolutionary Guards in an attack on an IRGC post on the Iraqi border in July, Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency reported, the latest bloodshed in an area where armed Kurdish opposition groups are active. Iran will be scrambling to determine the motives for today’s high-profile attack as it faces growing US pressure. President Donald Trump decided in May to pull the United States out of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Tehran and reimpose sanctions in a bid to isolate the Islamic Republic. ‘Where Did They Come From?’ A video on state television’s website showed confused soldiers at the scene of the attack. Standing in front of the stand, one asked: “Where did they come from?” Another responded: “From behind us.” Four militants carried out the attack and two of them were killed, according to ISNA. There has been no claim of responsibility for the attack in the city of Ahvaz. Iran was holding similar parades in several cities including the capital Tehran and the port of Bandar Abbas on the Gulf. “Shooting began by several gunmen from behind the stand during the parade. There are several killed and injured,” a correspondent told state television. Tensions between mainly Shi’ite Iran and mostly Sunni Saudi Arabia have surged in recent years, with the two countries supporting opposite sides in wars in Syria and Yemen and rival political parties in Iraq and Lebanon. Attacks on the military are rare in Iran. Last year, in the first deadly assault claimed by Islamic State in Tehran, 18 people were killed at the parliament and mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder and first supreme leader of the Islamic Republic."

"Gunmen attack headquarters of Libya’s state oil firm, two staff killed"	"Several armed men attacked the headquarters of Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) in the capital Tripoli on Monday, killing at least two staff members, a security official said. In the first attack of its kind against the top managers of Libya’s state oil industry, two of the gunmen were also killed and at least 10 NOC staff wounded, officials said. Security forces said they had regained control of the landmark glass-fronted building in the center of the city. The attack came less than a week after a fragile truce halted fierce clashes between rival armed groups in Tripoli, the latest eruption of violence in Libya, which has been in turmoil since a 2011 uprising toppled Muammar Gaddafi. Armed groups regularly block oilfields to make demands but the NOC headquarters had so far been spared the violence. The NOC provides the vast bulk of Libya’s state income and, along with the Tripoli-based central bank, is one of the only state institutions still functioning well amid chaos. No group immediately claimed responsibility for Monday’s attack. But the interior ministry said in a statement initial indications showed the gunmen belonged to Islamic State, which has previously carried out attacks in Tripoli and other Libyan towns and cities. Gunfire rang out in the morning as security forces allied to the Tripoli-based government arrived. Firefighters and security personnel are seen at the headquarters of Libyan state oil firm National Oil Corporation (NOC) after three masked persons attacked it in Tripoli, Libya September 10, 2018. REUTERS/Ismail Zitouny “The death toll so far is two killed from NOC staff and two attackers,” said Ahmad Ben Salim, spokesman for the Special Deterrence Force (Rada), one of the most powerful factions in Tripoli. Security forces smashed windows so staff could escape and several people were hurt by shattered glass, witnesses said. NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla and his office manager were seen safely leaving the building. Libya has been divided between rival governments and military factions based in the east and west of the country since 2014, causing political deadlock and an economic crisis. However, the NOC has continued to function relatively normally across Libya, which relies on oil exports for most of its income. Oil production has been hit by attacks on oil facilities and blockades, though last year it partially recovered to around one million barrels per day. Islamist militants have sleeper cells in northern cities as well as mobile units in Libya’s southern desert, according to Libyan and Western officials. In May, Islamic State claimed responsibility for a deadly attack on the national election commission offices in Tripoli. The group also claimed an attack in 2015 on the Corinthia hotel, a landmark location in Tripoli. The NOC attack came a day after the United Nations said major armed factions had agreed to freeze their positions to extend the ceasefire."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Ex-IS captive says son died in her lap from militant fire	"By the Associated Press DAMASCUS, Syria — A Syrian woman captured by Islamic State militants said her 8-year-old son died in her lap after the extremists shot him and his cousin during a military operation to liberate them more than 100 days after they were kidnapped. Najwa Abu Ammar, 35, was kidnapped with her two sons and daughter and nearly two dozen others in July from southern Sweida province in a bloody attack on their villages in which the militants killed over 200 people. When a military operation began to liberate them Thursday, the children panicked during the gunfire, she said. Her son Rafaat and his 13-year-old cousin Qusay ran and the militants fired at them. “We were in the open air at the bottom of a valley as the clashes raged between the army and gunmen,” she said. “When my son tried to run away, they (IS militants) shot him. He was in my lap when he died.” His cousin Qusay bled to death after nearly five hours, Abu Ammar said. ??I am very very sad,” she told The Associated Press in a telephone interview through a crackling line from her remote village of Shbiki. “I am tired.” A large funeral procession for the two children set out from the national hospital in Sweida to their village, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) to the east. “What is the sin of those innocent children, who should now be in their classrooms,” Monzer al-Shoufi, a resident of Sweida who took part in the procession, told AP by telephone. The family of Abu Ammar suffered another loss in the kidnapping — Rafaat’s grandmother was killed on the day of the abductions. Nashaat Abu Ammar, Rafaat’s father, said his mother was among those kidnapped by the militants, who forced the elderly, sick woman to walk about 4 kilometers (2.5 miles). When she failed to continue, they shot her dead. The rare attacks in the province populated mainly by minority Druze included several suicide bombings. The violence on July 25 devastated the community and shattered the region’s calm. At least 216 people were killed and the militants walked away with the captives. Nashaat Abu Ammar said about 20 of those killed were close relatives and 60 others were related. Najwa Abu Ammar said the captors held the group in different hideouts, including a camp and a cave, and once kept them in a moving car for over 12 hours, the captives not knowing where they were headed. The militants fed them sporadically and beat and insulted the children. They didn’t torture them, Abu Ammar said, but started threatening to kill them as time passed. At least two women and one man died in captivity, including a woman who was shot by the extremists to pressure authorities in negotiations for the captives’ release. “Sometimes they fed us once every two days and other times twice every day,” Abu Ammar said, adding that it was mostly just olive oil, thyme and jam. “They held us first in a camp then a cave and kept moving us from one place to the other,” she said. Abu Ammar said she didn’t know about the killed hostages until they were liberated. Six other hostages, two women and four children, had been freed in an exchange with the government in October. Negotiations were expected to free the remaining hostages but talks failed and Syrian troops launched a broad offensive against IS in southern Syria."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"In Syria’s Sweida, young men take up arms to defend villages"	" By the Associated Press SWEIDA, Syria (AP) — Maysoun Saab’s eyes filled with tears as she recalled finding her parents bleeding to death on the ground outside their home, minutes after they were shot by Islamic State militants on a killing spree across once tranquil villages they infiltrated in a southeastern corner of Syria. Within an hour, she had lost her mother, father, brother and 34 other members of her extended family. Overall, more than 200 people were killed and 30 hostages abducted in the coordinated July 25 attacks across Sweida province. It was one of the biggest single massacres of the Syrian civil war and the worst bloodshed to hit the province since the conflict began in 2011, underscoring the persistent threat posed by the Islamic State group, which has been largely vanquished but retains pockets of territory in southern and eastern Syria. More than two months after the attack, tensions over the missing hostages — all women and children — are boiling over in Sweida, a mountainous area which is a center for the Druze religious minority. Anger is building up, and young men are taking up arms. This week, the militants shot dead one of the women, 25-year-old Tharwat Abu Ammar, triggering protests and a sit-in outside the Sweida governorate building by relatives enraged at the lack of progress in negotiations to free them. It’s a stark change for a usually peaceful province that has managed to stay largely on the sidelines of the seven-year Syrian war, and where most villagers work grazing livestock over the surrounding hills. “We still haven’t really absorbed what happened to us. It’s like a dream or a nightmare that you don’t wake up from,” said Saab, a slender woman with a long braid showing underneath a loose white scarf covering her hair. During a rare visit to the Sweida countryside by an Associated Press team, armed young men and teens, some as young as 14, patrolled the streets. Some wore military uniforms, others the traditional black baggy pants and white caps worn by Druze villagers. They said the Syrian army had provided them with weapons to form civilian patrols to defend their towns and villages. Residents recalled a summer day of pure terror that began with gunfire and cries of “Allahu Akbar!” that rang out at 4 a.m. Militants who had slipped into the villages under the cover of darkness knocked on doors, sometimes calling out residents’ names to trick them into opening. Those who did were gunned down. Others were shot in their beds. Women and children were dragged screaming from their homes. Word of the attack spread in the villages of Shbiki, Shreihi and Rami as neighbors called one another to warn of the militant rampage. A series of suicide bombings unfolded simultaneously in the nearby provincial capital of Sweida. In Shreihi, a small agricultural village of cement houses, Maysoun and her husband were asleep in one room, their children, 16-year-old Bayar and 13-year-old Habib, in another when she heard the first burst of gunfire. From her window, she saw the silhouette of her neighbor, Lotfi Saab, and his wife in their house. Then she saw armed men push open the door, point a rifle at them and shoot. Maysoon screamed, her voice reverberating through the open window. The militants threw a grenade in her direction. Her husband climbed onto the roof of their home and aimed a hunting rifle at the men, while she hunkered downstairs with the children. At least two of the men blew themselves up nearby. At the crack of dawn, Maysoun heard another neighbor screaming, “Abu Khaled has been shot!” — referring to Maysoun’s father. Ignoring her husband’s orders to stay indoors, Maysoun ran over the rocky path to her parent’s house, and spotted her father’s bloodied body on the ground near the front porch. She screamed for her mother and found her lying nearby, shot in her leg, blood everywhere. “There is no greater tragedy than to see your parents like this, strewn on the ground before your eyes. We were together just the night before, staying up late together and talking. … They took them away from us,” she said, choking back tears. Maysoun’s brother, Khaled, meanwhile, was trapped with his wife and daughter in their home, fearfully watching the IS fighters from their shuttered window. Another brother, who rushed to their aid, was killed outside Khaled’s home. Less than an hour later, Maysoun called to tell Khaled that both their parents were dead. When he was able to leave his house, Khaled said he and other neighbors fought and killed as many IS militants as they could. He suffered two gunshot wounds in his thigh. But there was no time to grieve. “We didn’t have the chance to cry or feel anything, even if our father, mother, neighbors, friends, all of these people had died. But at the time there wasn’t a moment to cry for anyone,” said the 42-year-old truck driver. Residents said the village men fought with whatever weapons they could lay their hands on — hunting rifles, pistols, even sticks — against the far superior IS guns. The Islamic State group, which once held large swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq, has been mostly vanquished. Its de facto capital of Raqqa, in eastern Syria, fell a year ago this month. But the group fights on in eastern pockets like Deir el-Zour and Sweida province. Some here fear that as the militants flee the advancing Syrian government forces, they will try to regroup in remote pockets of territory like this once quiet corner of Syria. They fear another raid or more trouble because of the brewing tensions over the hostages IS still holds. On Tuesday, a video posted on the internet purported to show IS militants shoot Abu Ammar in the back of her head as they threatened to kill more hostages if the Syrian government and its Russian allies do not meet their demands, which include freeing IS fighters and their family members elsewhere in Syria. In the village of Rami, where 20 civilians from the Maqlad family were killed in the July assault, Nathem Maqlad points to bullet holes and blood stains on the ground from the battle with IS. “I stand ready and alert to defend our land and dignity all over again if I have to,” he said, walking with a group of young men with rifles slung over their shoulders."

"Widow of Orlando nightclub gunman knew of his plans, prosecutors say"	"ORLANDO (REUTERS) - The widow of the gunman who killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in 2016 cased possible attack sites with her husband and did nothing to stop his plans, prosecutors told jurors at her federal trial on Wednesday (March 14). But a defence attorney for Noor Salman said she was a“simple woman who loved children” and did not know that her husband, Omar Mateen, intended to carry out the Pulse nightclub shooting on June 12, 2016. Duelling portraits of Salman, 31, emerged during opening statements at her trial in US District Court in Orlando. She faces up to life in prison if she is convicted of aiding and abetting her husband and obstructing a federal investigation. “The defendant’s cold actions gave Omar Mateen the green light to commit these crimes” on behalf of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Assistant US Attorney James Mandolfo told jurors. She is the only person charged in the massacre. Mateen died in an exchange of gunfire with police. Mandolfo said the government will put on evidence that Salman had foreknowledge of her husband’s deadly plot, including statements she made to investigators just hours afterward. She was at home with the couple’s then-three-year-old son during the shooting spree. Defence attorney Linda Moreno told jurors Salman was unaware of her husband’s sinister plans. “Noor was in the dark about Omar’s secret and despicable life,” Moreno said. Moreno said the FBI did not record its interrogation of Salman and coerced her into making statements that favoured the prosecution. Following opening statements prosecutors called several witnesses to describe the bloodshed and testify about Mateen’s calls to authorities. The trial is expected to last a month. Mateen, 29, opened fire shortly after last call for drinks on the club’s popular Latin night. Holding hostages during his standoff with police, he claimed allegiance to a leader of the ISIS militant group. According to prosecutors, Salman initially told investigators her husband acted without her knowledge but later said she knew he was watching Islamic State recruitment videos, had purchased an assault rifle and examined three possible attack locations. Salman’s attorneys contend prosecutors could not show any direct links between Mateen and Islamic State and have provided no evidence that Salman aided her husband. Salman was indicted on two charges: obstruction of justice for alleged false statements to federal investigators, and aiding and abetting Mateen in his attempt to provide material support to a terrorist organization."

"Widow of Orlando nightclub gunman goes on trial, facing life in prison"	"ORLANDO, March 14 — A trial for the widow of the gunman who killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in what prosecutors say was an attack in the name of Islamic State, was set to begin today with opening statements by both sides. Noor Salman, widow of Omar Mateen, faces up to life in prison if she is convicted in US District Court in Orlando of aiding and abetting her husband and obstructing a federal investigation into the June 12, 2016 massacre at the Pulse nightclub. Salman, 31, was at home with the couple’s then-3-year-old son during the shooting rampage, which ended with Mateen’s death in an exchange of gunfire with police. But prosecutors say she knew of her husband’s plans and did nothing to stop him. The trial, which is expected to last for a month, will take place at the Orlando courthouse where protesters have been gathering during jury selection to call for a guilty verdict. Inside the courtroom, the owner of the Pulse nightclub, Barbara Poma, has been present for some of the initial proceedings. Although Salman initially told investigators that her husband acted without her knowledge, she later acknowledged being aware that her husband was watching Islamic State recruitment videos, had purchased an assault rifle and examined three possible attack locations, according to prosecutors. Salman’s attorneys contend the U.S. government could not show any direct links between Mateen and Islamic State before the attack and has provided no evidence that Salman aided her husband. In court papers filed on Tuesday defense lawyers asked that prosecutors not be allowed to tell jurors during opening statements that the shooting rampage was intended as an attack on the gay community or that Salman took part in her husband’s gun and ammunition purchases. “It was Mateen, not Noor, who decided to attack the Pulse Night Club, Mateen who chose to drive to the club, Mateen who purchased the weapon and ammunition, and Mateen who alone carried out the attack,” the defense said in court filings. Salman was indicted on two charges: obstruction of justice for alleged false statements to federal investigators, and aiding and abetting Mateen in his attempt to provide material support to a terrorist organisation. Mateen, 29, opened fire shortly after the last call for drinks on the club’s popular Latin night. Holding hostages during his standoff with police, he claimed allegiance to a leader of the Islamic State militant group before being fatally shot."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Thousands march for Belgium terror shooting victims	"LIEGE, June 4 — Nearly 3,000 people marched in the Belgian city of Liege yesterday to honour the three victims of a shooting there last week that prosecutors are treating as a terrorist attack. The marchers, most dressed in white, made a solemn procession through the city’s sunny streets before laying white roses at the scene of the attack by Benjamin Herman, who shot dead two policewomen and a student on Tuesday. Hundreds of white balloons were released into the sky at the culmination of the march, which comes ahead of official funerals on Tuesday for the two slain officers, who have both been posthumously awarded Belgium’s highest civilian decoration. “I think it’s important to be here, just to support the family, not to change things. Just to show to the family that we are here and support them,” Marie Pousset, who was among nearly 3,000 marchers according to local police, told AFP. Government officials and a representative of Belgium’s king are set to attend the funerals for police officers Lucile Garcia, 54, and Soraya Belkacemi, 44, on Tuesday morning. Student Cyril Vangriecken, 22, shot dead by Herman as he sat in the passenger seat of a parked car, will be buried on Monday. Belgian police have identified Herman, 31, as a serial offender who spent a decade in and out of prison for acts of violence and petty crimes and came into contact with extremist Islamists while in jail. Herman attacked the two policewomen with a knife, stabbing them repeatedly before taking their service pistols and shooting them, then Vangriecken. Herman went on to hole up in a nearby school, briefly taking a cleaner hostage before bursting out to confront police and being cut down in a hail of bullets. The Islamic State group claimed one of its “soldiers” was responsible for the attack, through its Amaq propaganda agency. IS said “he led the attack in response to calls to target the countries of the US-led international coalition,” which is fighting the jihadist group, mainly in Syria. Prosecutors said Herman’s method of attack has been encouraged in online videos from IS, which claimed a deadly double suicide bombing in Brussels in 2016. "	Terrorism	Terrorism
"At least 30 hurt in Guinea clashes: medical source, witnesses"	" At least 30 people were injured in clashes between opposition supporters and security forces in central Guinea, medical sources and witnesses said on Wednesday, after an opposition leader said his car was hit by gunfire a day earlier. Opposition leader Cellou Dalein Diallo, a chief rival of President Alpha Conde, on Tuesday said his vehicle was struck by a police bullet during a banned rally in the capital Conakry over disputed municipal elections. Police denied Diallo’s allegations, but a teenager was later killed during clashes between opposition youths and police in the capital. His family said he had been shot by police. Protests erupted on Wednesday after a meeting of Diallo’s UFDG party in Labe, his hometown and an opposition stronghold, 400 km (248 miles) north of Conakry, local party officials said. “There are at least 30 wounded among the demonstrators who we first received at the party headquarters before sending them to the regional hospital or private clinics,” said Dr. Saliou Malal Barry, who runs a private clinic in the town. Youths set up barricades and burned tires on several main routes in Labe to protest what Diallo had called an attempt to assassinate him. “We are ready for everything,” local UFDG representative Mamadou Dian Fadiga said. Local police official Amadou Camara said youths had taken to the streets, causing disturbances and forcing local businesses to shut down. “They were attacking everything close to them or anything appearing to be linked to the state and it took a massive deployment of security forces to calm the city centre,” Camara said. Tensions have been high in the poor West African country since the death on October 16 of a protester during a two-day opposition campaign aimed at bringing Conakry to a standstill. The opposition claims Conde’s government has reneged on a deal to install new officials elected in the contested February 4 municipal ballot, the first such vote since the end of a military dictatorship a decade ago. Authorities have started to install new municipal officials, with the opposition accusing the government of bribing some to keep control of local councils across the former French colony. The municipal elections had been repeatedly delayed because of political infighting and the Ebola crisis in 2013-16."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Saudi forces arrest armed ‘extremist’ after gunfight: Ministry	"Saudi forces have arrested a heavily armed “extremist” after wounding him in an exchange of gunfire in the kingdom’s conservative central heartland, the interior ministry said early Thursday. The man had embraced the Islamic State group’s “ideology” and was found to be in possession of a machine gun, a pistol and multiple rounds of ammunition, the ministry said in a statement. The man in Al-Bukhariya city was also wearing what appeared to be an explosives-laden belt, state-run Al-Ekhbariya television reported. The incident comes as the kingdom prepares to host the annual hajj pilgrimage from August 19-24. The kingdom has seen numerous attacks in recent years by jihadists, including Al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group, against security forces. It has also seen clashes between Shiite militants and security forces in the eastern provinces. In July, a drive-by shooting against a checkpoint in central Saudi Arabia and an ensuing gunfight left a security officer, a Bangladeshi civilian and two attackers dead, according to the interior ministry. And in April, four Saudi policemen were killed and four others wounded in an attack targeting a checkpoint in the southwestern province of Asir."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Paris attacks documentary shows victims’ defiance in face of horror	"PARIS, May 31 — “I’m not going to be killed by some guy in jogging pants,” one of the Bataclan survivors told herself as jihadists raked the Paris concert hall with gunfire. Remarkable testimony from dozens of survivors of the bloodbath form the core of a new three-part documentary about the November 13 carnage by the French brothers who won an Emmy for 9/11, the inside story of the heroics of New York firefighters on September 11, 2001. Although filmmaker Jules Naudet was in the World Trade Centre when the second plane struck — after already capturing the first one hitting the North Tower — he and his brother were not in Paris when the attackers struck in November 2015 , killing 130 people. But their documentary mini-series, Attack on Paris — which starts on Netflix tomorrow — tells the story through the eyes of those at the heart of the drama. Through 40 interviews with survivors, the first police and ambulance officers at the scenes and former French president Francois Hollande, the pair try to recreate the terrible night which began with a suicide bombing at the Stade de France football stadium. “You get the feeling that (the survivors) are all looking you in the eye” as they tell their stories, Jules Naudet told AFP. “It was about creating a bubble where you forget the outside world” and are plunged back into the events which “are told in the present tense”, he added. His brother Gedeon said the fact they themselves had lived through a major terror attack — the pair were with the firefighters as they tried to evacuate the towers — helped create a bond with the survivors. “They talked about things that you share between survivors. They themselves were surprised that they were so open, like you would be in therapy,” he said of the interviews, which were filmed over the course of eight months. “We told them about what happened to us on September 11, the stages of trauma we went through, and they were very curious,” Gedeon Naudet added. One of the most surprising things to emerge from the documentaries was the manner in which many of the survivors talk about the gunmen. None of the jihadists are ever named — nor is the Islamic State mentioned — so “the films can never be used as propaganda”, the brothers say. Instead, the Bataclan survivors refer to the killers with barely concealed derision, remembering “the big dumbo” or “the angry little git”, describing them collectively as blundering “donkeys”. One woman taken hostage as the attackers holed themselves up at the end of the siege, had a typically Parisian take on their dress sense. “I not going to be killed by some guy in jogging pants,” she said to herself. But others made no attempt to hide the horror that was unleashed as the gunmen burst in on a concert by US band Eagles of Death Metal. “The room transformed into an immense collective cry of agony,” one survivor recalled, while another talked of the “discreet heroism” of people trying to help each other in the most dangerous of circumstances. “It was so horrible that after a while my brain just cut off the sounds because it was unbearable,” said a third. Christophe Molmy, head of the police intervention brigade (BRI), said what he and his officers saw when they stormed the building will be forever “chiselled into our memories... It made me think of Dante’s ‘Inferno’,” he said."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"A year after extremist siege, Philippine families seek closure"	"Mahid Radia's last glimpse of his parents was when he and his children were fleeing their home amid gunfire, explosions and the howl of airplanes bombing the dens of extremists who had taken over Marawi, the Philippines' only Islamic city. MARAWI CITY, Philippines: Mahid Radia's last glimpse of his parents was when he and his children were fleeing their home amid gunfire, explosions and the howl of airplanes bombing the dens of extremists who had taken over Marawi, the Philippines' only Islamic city. The military prevailed over Islamic State-inspired rebels in the country's biggest and longest battle since World War Two. One year since the fighting began, there is peace in Marawi, but little else. Radia's lakeside home is a pile of rubble, like scores of others in the former war zone. His mother and father are still missing, and he yearns for closure. ""Our parents decided to stay home in the belief the fighting would end in days,"" said Radia, 31, the eldest of 11 siblings. ""We pray that if they died, their remains were retrieved."" Hundreds of families are missing relatives since the start of a war that few saw coming, and which could happen again, the government has warned, if Islamic State's radical ideology spreads among the Muslim minority in the mainly Catholic nation. About 165 security forces and 47 residents were confirmed killed in the battle for Marawi. But people from Marawi believe the number of civilians killed was far higher. The official death toll in the five-month war is 1,109, mostly members of a shadowy militant alliance that drew fighters from radical factions of domestic Islamist groups. It has taken six months to clear hundreds of unexploded bombs and booby traps and for volunteers to sift the debris. Samples of DNA have been taken from 244 retrieved bodies, prior to their burial in numbered graves. Radia hopes to find his mother and father, but tracing matches is difficult. Relatives have claimed just 11 bodies so far. The task becomes tougher because the bodies of residents trapped or held captive in the war zone cannot be distinguished from those of slain militants. ""We had instances when we identified the deceased and we coordinated with the relatives, but they did not claim the cadaver,"" said Norhanie Marohombsar, the head of the interior ministry in Marawi. ""The relatives fear being tagged as part of the insurgency."" Authorities and aid workers have different estimates of the number of residents still missing since the fighting ended in October. Marawi Mayor Majul Gandamra put the number at 50, while the provincial disaster agency says it is 78. International Committee of the Red Cross workers in Marawi estimate 100 families are missing relatives. Marawi evacuee Malik Manguda struggles to move on with his life because he does not know what happened to his 20-year-old son, Ramos. He has seen a photograph of a dead body that resembles his son, but it's not enough. ""Many times I am not myself,"" said Manguda. ""I thought parents are supposed to die ahead of their children."" About 28,000 families remain displaced and many fear they will have no home to return to. With no money or insurance, some must also tackle issues of proving land ownership. Residents have taken every opportunity to stake their claims during visits the military has recently begun to allow to the battle zone, lasting just a few hours each. Names and contact details are spraypainted or etched in charcoal on the blackened skeletons of former homes. Others came prepared with tarpaulins and painted banners. The military is bent on preventing a repeat of Marawi, but intelligence reports suggest an effort by extremists to start recruiting again. The government has warned against potential attacks on other cities. The army has held meetings and seminars to warn people to resist radical groups and help the government to stop them.

"US, Afghanistan launch air strikes as Taliban attack western city"	"US and Afghan aircraft Tuesday bombed Taliban positions in the western city of Farah after the insurgents launched a major attempt to capture the provincial capital, with fearful residents seeking shelter from explosions and gunfire. Special forces from Kandahar and Herat were rushed to the city to take part in the fighting, which residents said began around midnight. Sporadic clashes were still ongoing late Tuesday, provincial council member Dadullah Qani told AFP. It was the latest in a series of attempts by the Taliban over the past three years to capture urban centres. Afghan forces have been struggling to hold back the resurgent militant group since the withdrawal of NATO combat forces at the end of 2014. Afghan officials and NATO’s Resolute Support mission said that the government remained in control, but the Taliban also appeared confident, posting a flurry of social media updates throughout the day that purported to show their fighters in the city. Farah province, which borders Iran, has been the scene of intense fighting in recent years, and there have long been fears that the city is vulnerable. “The situation is very bad,” Satar Hussaini, a tribal elder in Farah, told AFP earlier. “Heavy fighting is going on and Taliban are in the city but the police headquarters and NDS (the Afghan intelligence agency) have not fallen to them,” he said. “NDS forces in their HQ are engaged in heavy clashes with the Taliban.” Qani confirmed Hussaini’s comments. Gunfire and explosions could be heard as he spoke to an AFP reporter by telephone. The noise has “filled the city”, said one resident who gave his name as Bilal, adding that he could see smoke rising from the direction of a building housing the NDS. NATO’s Resolute Support mission in Kabul said the government remained in control of the city. “Both Afghan A-29s and Mi-17s have conducted multiple strikes. U.S. forces have conducted one drone strike (MQ-9) and a show-of-force with A-10s. Dozens of Taliban killed.” Defence ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanish said pockets of resistance remained, but “our forces are battling the enemy with high morale”. With internet and mobile networks patchy, casualty figures were difficult to verify. Radmanish said four soldiers and “dozens” of insurgents had been killed. At least some militants have been hiding in private houses, making it difficult for Afghan forces to use heavy weapons, Farah governor Abdul Basir Salangi told Ariana News, adding: “But still we are taking back positions one by one.” Many radio and television channels in the province have stopped broadcasting, fearing for their employees’ lives, according to media watchdog Nai. The insurgents in a statement warned residents to remain in their homes and “stay calm”. The Taliban are stepping up their spring offensive, in an apparent rejection of a peace talks overture from the government. But it has been the scene of intense fighting in recent years. In 2017, insurgents tried three times to overrun the capital, according to the Afghanistan Analysts Network. As such, Tuesday’s offensive “should not have taken government forces off guard”, said military analyst and retired general Atiqullah Amarkhail. Amarkhail added that “even ordinary citizens were aware of the Taliban gradually taking over more areas and becoming a formidable force in the province”. He accused the government and military leadership of “turning a blind eye” until the insurgents actually entered the city. Afghan troops and police nationwide have struggled to cope with unrelenting militant attacks in recent years, their numbers sapped by killings and desertions. When asked about the issue, US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said that Afghan forces are actually being bolstered in the most important area — special operations forces. Speaking earlier this month, he said this expansion was why the Taliban had not taken any district centres or provincial centres. The insurgents have tried several times to take provincial capitals in recent years, including Kunduz and Lashkar Gah, with the Afghan army deploying significant numbers of troops to hold those cities and push the militants out. Kunduz, Afghanistan’s fifth largest city and capital of the northern province of the same name, fell briefly to the Taliban in 2015. They along with the Islamic State group have also stepped up their attacks in the capital Kabul, which the UN says has in recent years become one of the country’s deadliest places for civilians."

Heavy fighting as Taliban attack western Afghan city	" Afghan aircraft Tuesday bombed Taliban positions in the western city of Farah after the insurgents launched a major attempt to capture the provincial capital, with fearful residents seeking shelter from explosions and gunfire. The attack — the first major assault targeting a city since the Taliban launched their annual spring offensive — began around midnight, with the militants capturing one urban district and parts of another, said local provincial council member Jamila Amini. “Heavy fighting continues inside the city and aircraft have just started bombarding Taliban positions,” she told AFP Tuesday from inside Farah. Afghan officials said police special forces from Kandahar and commandos from Herat had also been deployed. “(The Taliban) will fail,” vowed interior ministry spokesman Najib Danish, who said both Afghan and foreign air forces were taking part in the fighting. There was no immediate confirmation from NATO’s mission in Kabul. Defence ministry spokesman Mohammad Radmanish said at least 10 insurgents and two Afghan security force members had been killed so far. “The situation is under control and will change by the end of the day,” he said. But inside the city residents reported clashes were continuing. “The situation is very bad,” Satar Hissaini, a tribal elder in Farah, told AFP. “Heavy fighting is going on and Taliban are in the city but the police headquarters and NDS (the Afghan intelligence agency) have not fallen to them,” he said. “NDS forces in their HQ are engaged in heavy clashes with the Taliban.” Another provincial council member, Dadullah Qani, confirmed Hissaini’s comments, the sound of gunfire and explosions audible as he spoke to an AFP reporter by telephone. The noise has “filled the city”, said one resident who gave his name as Bilal, adding that he could see smoke rising from the direction of a building housing the NDS. At least some militants have been hiding in residential houses, making it difficult for Afghan forces to use heavy weapons, Farah governor Abdul Basir Salangi told Ariana News, adding: “But still we are taking back positions one by one”. The insurgents released a statement warning residents to stay inside their homes and “stay calm”. They have also been posting images on social media they claim shows them inside the city. Many radio and television channels in the province have stopped broadcasting, fearing for their employees’ lives, according to media watchdog Nai. The Taliban are stepping up their spring offensive, in an apparent rejection of a peace talks overture from the government. Farah is a poppy-growing province in an isolated region of Afghanistan. There are plans for a section of the multi-billion-dollar TAPI (Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India) gas pipeline to traverse it, a project the Taliban have pledged to cooperate with. But it has been the scene of intense fighting in recent years. In 2017 insurgents tried three times to overrun the capital, according to the Afghanistan Analysts Network. As such Tuesday’s offensive “should not have taken government forces off guard,” Afghan military analyst and retired general Atiqullah Amarkhail told AFP.

 Suicide attack on Libya election commission kills 12	"TRIPOLI, May 2 — Suicide attackers killed at least 12 people at Libya’s electoral commission in the capital Tripoli today, authorities in the violence-wracked country said, after witnesses reported thick smoke and gunfire. The internationally backed Government of National Accord (GNA) said it was dealing with “the consequences of the cowardly suicide attack” after the health ministry put the toll at 12 dead and seven wounded. Four armed assailants attacked the building this morning, a senior security official in Tripoli, Mohamad al-Damja, told AFP. “They killed the guards before opening fire at people on the premises,” he said. At least two of the attackers detonated their explosives when the security forces arrived, Damja added, describing the building as seriously damaged after it caught on fire. Security forces have since brought the situation under control, he said, while the site has been sealed off. Eyewitnesses earlier said shots and at least two explosions were heard, while black smoke could be seen rising from the headquarters of the national election commission. The assault has not yet been claimed. Election hopes -The United Nations mission in Libya condemned the “terrorist attack” and said it extended “its condolences to the families of the victims who lost their lives”. “Such terrorist attacks will not deter Libyans from moving forward in the process of consolidating national unity and building the state of law and institutions,” it said on Twitter. The UN is hoping that Libya can hold elections this year as it seeks to leave behind years of chaos since the 2011 ouster of dictator Muammar Gaddafi. UN special envoy Ghassan Salame said in February he was aiming for parliamentary and presidential elections in the North African country by the end of 2018, but warned conditions were not yet ready for polling. The electoral commission is considered to be one of the few credible and independent institutions in the country. Elections were banned during Kadhafi’s 42-rule and after his ousting legislative polls were organised in 2012 and 2014. But turmoil has continued in Libya with rival militias, tribes and jihadists vying for territory and the country’s vast oil wealth. A 2015 UN-backed deal to set up the GNA in Tripoli failed to end the turmoil, as divisions continue with a rival administration in the east. Human Rights Watch warned in March the country was far from ready in political, judicial or security terms for elections, citing harassment of activists and journalists as among the problems to be overcome. A new constitution has to be put to a referendum and an electoral law adopted before polling. As of March, 2.4 million Libyan voters had been registered of a population of six million. While most recent attacks across Libya have been outside Tripoli, the capital remains mired by insecurity. In January clashes between rival militias around the city’s only working international airport left some 20 people dead. In 2015 the Islamic State group claimed an attack on Tripoli’s luxury Corinthia Hotel that killed nine people, including five foreigners."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Four Saudi officers killed in gun attack	"Four Saudi officers were shot dead and four others wounded Thursday when their checkpoint came under gunfire in southern Asir province, state media said citing the interior ministry. Three officers were instantly killed when the outpost came under attack, the Saudi Press Agency reported, without specifying who was behind it. ""Security officials have succeeded in identifying a number of suspects involved in the crime and arrested two of them, both Saudi nationals,"" SPA said. ""In the interest of the investigation, their names cannot be revealed."" A third Saudi suspect opened fire as he tried to escape, killing another officer and wounding four others, SPA added. The attack comes as Saudi Arabia is embroiled in a long running conflict in its southern neighbor Yemen, dubbed by the United Nations as the world's worst humanitarian crisis. In March 2015, the kingdom launched a coalition of Arab states fighting to roll back Iran-backed Huthi rebels in Yemen and restore the country's internationally-recognised government to power. Riyadh and Shiite rival Tehran back opposing sides in a range of hotspots across the mainly Sunni Muslim Middle East, including Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.

Indonesian police foil terror attacks ahead of Polling Day	"Indonesian police have foiled at least two terrorist attacks planned for the upcoming regional elections, after officers shot dead three suspects last week in West Java. The separate incidents, which took place in Subang last Friday and Depok last Saturday, come just days before more than 150 million Indonesians head to the polls to elect their local leaders on Wednesday. The suspect killed in Friday's police ambush on an overpass in Pamanukan, Subang, was carrying a homemade bomb, complete with a detonator, in his backpack, said the police yesterday. He was shot after he lunged at police officers with a knife as he was being apprehended. National police spokesman M. Iqbal said the suspect, identified only as M, was preparing to strike during the June 27 elections, known locally as Pilkada. Two other suspects, killed in a similar police operation on Saturday morning, also had plans to mount attacks on Polling Day. AS and AZ were gunned down by the police in Depok after they tried to resist arrest. Another suspect, MM, was nabbed later that same day in connection to AS and AZ. According to General Iqbal, the two men, aged 27 and 31, were armed with a commando knife and a loaded FN pistol. FN is the acronym for Belgium-based Fabrique Nationale, one of the world's largest exporters of military small arms. Gen Iqbal did not say where the suspects may have acquired the pistol, although he confirmed that both AS and AZ had previously undergone paramilitary training under Indonesian militant leader Bahrumsyah. It is widely believed that Bahrumsyah is in command of a group of South-east Asian militants who have travelled to the Middle East to fight for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). But the authorities have been investigating online chatter picked up in April saying that the Indonesian militant was killed during air strikes in Syria by the United States. Bahrumsyah is a senior figure in the Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), an Indonesian terrorist network. Both he and JAD leader Aman Abdurrahman were placed on a US terrorist watch list in January last year. The US State Department also referred to the JAD as a terrorist group that pledged allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The JAD is responsible for the spate of terrorist attacks in Indonesia. These include the January 2016 siege in the capital Jakarta, which killed four bystanders; the twin suicide bombings in East Jakarta on May 23 last year, which killed three policemen; and last month's series of suicide bombings in Surabaya, in which 14 victims died. Security has been beefed up in the country, with the government mobilising the military to supplement the police force in a move made possible after Indonesia's anti-terror laws were amended following the Surabaya bombings. The country remains on edge as the upcoming polls being held in 171 regions are also coming after a South Jakarta court last Friday sentenced Aman to death for inciting the attack in Jakarta two years ago, as well as at least four other JAD strikes across the country. The court's decision marked the end of a closely watched trial, which started after the police, in a rare move last August, decided to identify the terrorist leader as a suspect in attacks that he was not directly involved in. Aman has been in prison since 2010, and was serving time for funding a Jemaah Islamiah paramilitary training camp in Aceh, when four JAD militants mounted the Jakarta strike in 2016. He is said to have ordered his followers to mount attacks from behind bars, purportedly using mobile phones hidden in his cell. Analyst Adhe Bhakti, who has followed the militant leader's rise to the top of the JAD, told The Straits Times that Aman remains an influential figure and ""revenge attacks by his followers can be expected""."

Police nab terror suspects in Medan	"Counterterrorism squad Densus 88, with the assistance of North Sumatra Police personnel, have arrested a number of terror suspects in several locations in North Sumatra, including the provincial capital of Medan, following the church attacks in Surabaya. North Sumatra Police chief Insp. Gen. Paulus Waterpauw confirmed the arrests, including one in Tanjung Balai city on Tuesday, where security personnel shot one suspect dead and injured another for resisting arrest. Meanwhile, Densus 88 personnel arrested at least two other suspects in Medan, who were identified as 28-year-old ojek driver MYR and 38-year-old milk seller SL, on the same day. A suspect identified as W reportedly fled during an attempted arrest. All suspects have been taken to the North Sumatra Police’s Mobile Brigade headquarters and put under heavy guard of police personnel. The police, however, had yet to publish the number and names of suspects as of Wednesday evening. “We are still investigating it,” North Sumatra Police spokesman Adj. Sr. Comr. Tatan Dirsan Atmaja said. Since the suicide bombings on three churches in East Java’s Surabaya, police personnel have arrested a number of terror suspects across the country, namely 13 in East Java, two in South Sumatra’s Palembang, one in Riau’s Pekanbaru and three in Banten’s Tangerang. The police have also shot dead several others including four in Pekanbaru. "	Terrorism	Terrorism

The block of flats in Harlesden was evacuated during the operation to make the devices safe and residents have since been allowed to return, London’s Metropolitan Police said in a statement. The devices are undergoing forensic examination and the force’s Counter Terrorism Command has launched an investigation. Chief Superintendent Simon Rose called on the public to come forward with any information. “I also want to reassure the local community that we have carried out precautionary searches in the surrounding area to make sure there was nothing else of a similar nature nearby, which I’m pleased to confirm is the case,” he said.

7 wounded including 2 British tourists in Paris knife attack	"PARIS — Seven people including two British tourists were wounded Sunday in Paris after they were attacked by a man armed with a knife and an iron bar, according to police and other sources. A source close to the inquiry said the suspect, believed to be an Afghan national, has been arrested. ""Nothing at this stage shows signs of a terrorist nature in these assaults,"" the source said, adding that the attacker had targeted ""strangers in the street"". Of the seven wounded, four are in a critical condition, police said. The incident took place just after 11:00pm (2100 GMT) on the banks of a canal in the northeast of the capital. A security guard at one of two cinemas on either side of the Bassin de la Villette, part of the Canal de l’Ourcq, said he saw a man who had already assaulted people being chased by two other men who tried to stop him. ""He had an iron bar in his hand which he threw at the men chasing him, then he took out a knife,"" he said. Another eyewitness, 28-year-old Youssef Najah, said he was walking along the canal near a bowling green when he saw a man running and holding a knife about 25-30cm long. ""There were around 20 people chasing him. They started throwing Petanque balls at him,"" Najah said, referring to the sport popular in France also known as boules. ""Around four or five balls hit him in the head, but they weren’t able to stop him,"" he added. According to the same witness, the attacker then dived into an alleyway, where the man ""tried to hide behind two British tourists. We said to them: ’Watch out, he has a knife"". But they didn’t react"". The pair were then attacked, he said. High alert A police investigation has been launched for attempted murder, according to a judicial source. It is the latest of several knife attacks France has seen in recent months, with terrorism being ruled out in most cases. On August 23, a man stabbed his mother and sister to death and seriously injured another person in a town near Paris before being shot dead by police. The motive for the violence remained unclear despite a claim by the Islamic State (IS) group that it was an attack by one of its fighters responding to the terror organisation’s propaganda. Authorities said the 36-year-old had serious mental health problems and had been on a terror watch list since 2016. That attack came days after an Afghan asylum-seeker was arrested in the town of Perigueux for a drunken rampage with a knife in which four people were wounded, one seriously. Police said investigators had ""very quickly"" dismissed a terrorist motive after the August 13 incident. And on June 17, two people were hurt in another southern town when a woman shouting ""Allahu akbar"" (God is greatest) attacked them in a supermarket with a boxcutter knife. France has been on high alert following a string of jihadist attacks in recent years, often by people who have become radicalised or claim to have acted in the name of the IS group. More than 240 people have been killed by Islamic extremists since a massacre at the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine in Paris in January 2015."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Spanish police treat attempted knife attack as terrorist act	"MADRID: A man, wielding a knife and uttering the word ""Allah"" lunged at an officer in a police station near Barcelona, Spain, on Monday in what police said was a terrorist act, and was shot dead. Police said the man entered the station in Cornella, in the northeastern region of Catalonia, shortly before 0400 GMT, seeking information. He then leapt towards a female officer, brandishing a large knife, they said. The attacker, identified only as living in Cornella, was shot dead. ""The officer can only remember that he used the word Allah, the other words were incomprehensible,"" regional investigating police chief Rafel Comas told a news conference. ""On this evidence, for the moment, we are treating it as a terrorist attack."" The Arabic phrase ""Allahu akbar"" (God is greatest) has often been used by jihadist attackers. The attacker ""wanted to die himself"", police added on Twitter. Comas did not confirm Spanish media reports that he was a 29-year-old Algerian, saying only that he had been in the country ""for years"". Forensic investigators and officers with dogs later searched the attacker's house in Cornella, evacuating neighbouring houses as a precaution. ""With the information that we have right now we can say that it was an isolated event that targeted the police,"" Catalan interior minister Miquel Buch said at a news conference when he was asked whether the attacker was part of a terrorist cell. Buch added the situation had been dealt with. Spain would maintain its security alert at level 4, one notch below the maximum level which signals an attack is imminent. Last Friday, Barcelona commemorated the first anniversary of an Islamist assault in which a young man drove a van down a busy central boulevard, killing 14 people and injuring over 100 in Spain's worst attack in more than a decade. Separately on Monday, three people were injured when a car mounted a pavement in the northern town of Casetas, in what a government spokeswoman later said was being treated as an accident. The two occupants of the car fled the scene and were later detained."	Terrorism	Terrorism
UK police hunt object that poisoned couple with nerve agent	"SALISBURY, July 6 — Police today raced to find the object that contaminated a British couple with the Soviet-made Novichok nerve agent in southwestern England where a former Russian spy was poisoned with the same toxin four months ago. Dawn Sturgess, 44, and Charlie Rowley, 45, fell ill on Saturday in Amesbury, a small town near the city of Salisbury where Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia collapsed on March 4, spreading fear once again among locals. Police said they had established that the couple, who remain in a critical condition in hospital, were exposed to the nerve agent after “handling a contaminated item.” They also did not rule out the possibility of more people coming into contact with the poison, which they suspect may have been left over from the attempted murder on the Skripals, although police have yet to determine whether it was the same batch. “It is rather scary,” local resident Geoffrey, 66, told AFP, as he walked by the canal. “It is an agent, it is not a gun or a knife that you can find and dispose of. It is something different, it could be on that bench... it makes me worried.” Dentist Jane Turner, 57, said she was concerned about children who “can pick things up without even thinking”. London blames Russia for the Skripal attack, with interior minister Sajid Javid on Thursday accusing Moscow of using Britain as a “dumping ground for poison”. “It is now time that the Russian state comes forward and explains exactly what has gone on,” Javid told parliament. “It is completely unacceptable for our people to be either deliberate or accidental targets, or for our streets, our parks, our towns to be dumping grounds for poison.” But Russia quickly hit back, denouncing Britain for playing “dirty political games”, trying to “muddy the waters” and “frighten its own citizens”. “We urge British law enforcement not to get involved in dirty political games,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters. “This government and its representatives will have to apologise to Russia and the international community,” she said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described the case as “very worrying” but said Russia had no information “about what substances were used and how they were used”. The Skripal incident triggered a major diplomatic crisis, leading to Britain and its allies withdrawing diplomatic staff from Moscow and tit-for-tat expulsions by Russia. Novichok is a military-grade nerve agent developed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. A government scientist told the BBC yesterday that the agent can be degraded by water and sunlight, meaning it was unlikely the contamination took place in the open, and said that it was so toxic that it could pass through the skin. Police declared a major incident on Wednesday after Sturgess and then Rowley collapsed on Saturday. They initially suspected that the couple had consumed a contaminated batch of illegal drugs, saying they had found “paraphernalia” in the house, but tests at nearby defence laboratory Porton Down revealed they had been exposed to Novichok. A friend of Rowley’s told AFP that he was a drug user and Sturgess lived in a homeless hostel in Salisbury. Around 100 counter-terror detectives are now working alongside police on the investigation, with officers in protective equipment and police tape once again visible on the quiet streets of Salisbury. Several sites in the city and nearby Amesbury that were visited by the couple have been cordoned off, including a park and Sturgess’s homeless hostel in Salisbury, as well as a pharmacy, church and the house in Amesbury where they fell ill. Officials said there was only a “low risk” to the wider public, but urged anyone who had visited the affected sites to wash their clothes and wipe down personal items. The Novichok used in March was believed to have been smeared on the Skripal’s front door. Police said there was no evidence the latest victims had visited any of the sites linked to the Skripals, which have since been decontaminated. Sam Hobson, a friend of the couple, said he had visited Salisbury with them the day before they fell ill. Hobson said he went to Rowley’s house on Saturday as Sturgess was being taken to hospital and stayed with him for several hours until he too began to complain of feeling ill. “He was sweating loads, dribbling, and you couldn’t speak to him,” Hobson said. “It’s like he was in another world, hallucinating.” "	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Police shoot knife-wielding man at Berlin Cathedral, 'terror' ruled out"	"BERLIN: Police shot and wounded a knife-wielding man inside Berlin's main cathedral on Sunday (Jun 3) but said there was no indication the assailant had a ""terrorist"" motive. The man with the knife, a 53-year-old Austrian, was ""yelling and causing damage"" before being shot in the leg shortly after 4.00 pm (8.00pm Singapore time), police said in a statement. When the incident began, about 100 people were evacuated from the landmark Berlin Cathedral in the heart of the German capital. When officers arrived they urged the man to put down the knife and tried to neutralise him with irritant gas, to no success, police said. Finally, they faced the assailant near the altar of the cathedral, and ""the man was wounded in the leg by a shot from a policeman,"" a spokesman said. The man was hospitalised and underwent surgery, the spokesman added. A policeman was also slightly injured by a ricocheting bullet from another officer, but was able to leave the hospital in the evening. Witnesses told local media that the man appeared ""very confused"". ""Based on what we know so far, we have no information that the suspect in any way had a terrorist or Islamist motive,"" a police spokesman said. The iron-domed Protestant cathedral, one of the city's top tourist attractions, is on Museum Island off east Berlin's main Unter den Linden boulevard and close to the Alexanderplatz shopping district. An AFP reporter said the entrances to the church were blocked off with red-and-white police tape and several officers with automatic weapons were patrolling the scene. DPA news agency said some witnesses were taken away to receive psychological counselling. The shooting comes with authorities in a state of high alert for militant attacks after several assaults claimed by the Islamic State group in the country. Like other European nations, Germany remains a target for Islamist militant groups, in particular because of its involvement in the coalition fighting IS in Iraq and Syria, and its deployment in Afghanistan since 2001. In the worst militant attack in the country to date, Tunisian asylum seeker Anis Amri rammed a truck into crowds at a Berlin Christmas market in December 2016, killing 12. The assault occurred in the shadow of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, a war-damaged landmark in the west of the capital. A court in March sentenced a 26-year-old Palestinian asylum seeker to life in prison for killing one and wounding six others with a knife in a Hamburg supermarket out of a ""jihadist"" motive last July. In April, Berlin police briefly detained six men amid fears of an attack on the city's half marathon, which drew 36,000 runners. But they were released when searches of their homes and vehicles netted no weapons, explosives or other evidence. The same weekend, a German driver in the western city of Muenster ploughed a van into an open-air restaurant, killing two people. The driver later shot himself and investigators cited mental health problems, not a political motive, as being behind the attack. Germany's security services estimate there are around 10,000 Islamic radicals in Germany, some 1,600 of whom are suspected of being potentially violent. Political opponents of Chancellor Angela Merkel, including the far-right AfD party, have charged that the security situation has worsened with the arrival of more than one million migrants and refugees since 2015, many from African and Middle Eastern conflict hotspots."

"Finland knife attacker was fully aware of his actions, according to psychiatric assessment"	"HELSINKI, March 9 — A Moroccan man charged with two murders and eight attempted murders “with terrorist intent” was criminally responsible for his knife attacks in Finland last August, a psychiatric assessment showed yesterday. The trial of Abderrahman Bouanane, who was 22 at the time at the attacks, is due to begin in the city of Turku later this month. The state prosecutor has demanded a life sentence for him if the court rules he was fully aware of his actions. Bouanane has admitted the attacks but has denied that his motive was terrorism. The police have concluded that he was a “lone wolf” who saw himself as a soldier for the Islamic State militant group. ISIS did not take responsibility for the act. Bouanane arrived in Finland in 2016, lived in a reception centre in Turku and had been denied asylum. It is the Nordic country’s first terrorism-related attack. A life sentence in Finland means at least 12 years in prison."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Belgium police open fire on attacker with knife	" BRUSSELS, Jan 24 — Railway security opened fire yesterday on a man who threatened them with a knife at a train station in the Belgian city of Ghent, Belgian media said. RTBF television said the man’s condition was not immediately known following the incident whose circumstances and possible motive remained unclear. Belgium lowered its terror threat level Monday after three years of high alert that included the March 2016 Brussels suicide bombings, but soldiers continued to guard key sites. The federal prosecutor’s office which handles terrorism cases told AFP the incident “was not a case for the federal prosecutor at this stage, but it could be one later”."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Dutch intelligence thwart four terror plots since 2011	"THE HAGUE, Jan 11 — Dutch security forces have thwarted four planned terror attacks in the Netherlands since late 2011, the country’s intelligence agency said today. The country’s top spy chief, Rob Bertholee, told the NOS broadcaster late yesterday that he could say his service had recently foiled “two to three” attacks, but then agreed that since he took up his post in December 2011 the force had averted three to four terror-related plots. A spokesman for the intelligence and security agency AIVD told AFP it was four plots that had been uncovered in the past few years. “It is of course an issue of definition,” added spokesman Hilbert Bredemeijer. Bertholee told NOS he could “dare to say that we have prevented an attack,” mentioning the case of a Dutch citizen jailed for four years in November for preparing a terror strike. The man was arrested in 2016, after police discovered an assault rifle and a large amount of fireworks in his Rotterdam apartment. Asked by NOS how many plots had been detected, Bertholee said “recently there have been two or three which I cannot divulge because some of them are still being dealt with and are still before the courts”. He said sometimes it was only “with hindsight” that it was possible to say whether an arrest had been terror-related. The Netherlands has so far been spared from the assaults by Islamic jihadists which have rocked its neighbours in recent years, including France, Belgium and Britain. But amid a number of scares, and reports that people linked to some of those attacks may have crossed briefly into the country, Dutch security and intelligence officials have been on high alert. “The main thing which is complicated here is that we are obviously investigating something which may happen,” Bertholee added in the extract of his interview. The full interview will be broadcast on NOS on January 21. On Christmas Eve, Dutch police arrested four men including a Swedish citizen on suspicion of being involved in terror-related activities. In another scare, Dutch military police shot and wounded a man armed with a knife at Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport causing panic among travellers in mid-December. But the authorities said the man was “confused” and the incident was not terror-related."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Knife-wielding man attacks police in Jambi	" A man attacked personnel at a police station in Muarojambi regency in Jambi on Tuesday. Two policemen, identified as Adj. Second Insp. Manalu and Chief Brig. Sangab Tinambunan, were wounded in the attack.

The attacker, identified as SD, 34, is now being interrogated, Jambi Police chief Brig. Gen. Muchlis AS said. The police suspected that other people might have assisted SD in carrying out the attack, but the police have yet to conclude if the attack was terror related. "	Terrorism	Terrorism
Three arrested over alleged Melbourne terror plot	"MELBOURNE — Three men who allegedly plotted ""chilling"" terror attacks in Melbourne were arrested early Tuesday, less than two weeks after a stabbing rampage inspired by the Islamic State group left two dead in Australia’s second city, police said. The trio, all Australian nationals of Turkish descent, were detained by counter-terror police in overnight raids as they escalated preparations to attack crowded areas of Melbourne, according to police. The men were ""certainly inspired by ISIS"", the Islamic State group, but had no known links to a specific organisation, Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton said. The three, who were not named but included two brothers, had been under investigation since March but had become ""more energised"" since the IS-inspired stabbing attack in Melbourne on November 9, Ashton said. The men had sought to purchase semi-automatic .22 calibre rifles and police were concerned they could target upcoming Christmas season events that will see huge crowds gathering in the city. ""There was a view towards a crowded place, a place where maximum people would be attending, to be able to kill, we allege, as maximum an amount of people as possible,"" Ashton told reporters. The group had not yet picked a specific target or time for the attack, and Ashton added that police were confident Tuesday’s arrests had ""neutralised any threat to the... community from this group"". In the November 9 attack, a Somali-born Australian, Hassan Khalif Shire Ali, stabbed and killed one man and wounded two others in a central shopping area before being shot dead by police. Coincidentally, the victim of that attack, Sisto Malaspina, 74, was honoured by a state funeral in Melbourne on Tuesday. Hundreds of Melbournians and dignitaries attended a service at Melbourne’s St Patrick’s Cathedral to bid farewell to Malaspina, the beloved owner of a local Italian cafe and a well-known figure on the city’s vibrant restaurant scene. The three arrested men were aged 30, 26 and 21, and will be charged in a Melbourne court later in the day with terrorism-related offences that carry a potential penalty of life in prison, police said. ""If we had not acted early in preventing this attack, we’ll allege the consequences would have been chilling, with... a potential significant loss of human life,"" said Ian Mccartney, a federal counter-terror police spokesman. Australian police have charged 90 people in relation to 40 counter-terrorism investigations since 2014, when the country’s terror alert level was raised to ""probable"". Melbourne has been the target for a number of attacks and plots. In addition to the November 9 knife rampage, a 28-year-old man was convicted on six counts of murder last week for mowing down dozens of people in the same street in January 2017, and another man is in jail awaiting trial for a plot to cause mass casualties in the city’s Federation Square. Shire Ali, like the three men arrested Tuesday, had his passport cancelled to keep him from joining ISIS in the Mideast, and Ashton said this may have led to their actions at home. ""Unfortunately, the ISIS propaganda machine and that of al-Qaeda promotes this type of activity so when people are prevented from travelling or it’s difficult to get to the conflict zone, often the view will be to change tack and commit an act in the country in which they live,"" he said. Police said the probe which led to Tuesday’s arrests had been complicated by their use of encrypted messaging applications, an element certain to fuel debate about government attempts to force device makers and telecom companies to grant access to the applications.

Terror attacker was ‘inspired by Islamic State’	"Sydney?A Somali-born Australian who went on a deadly knife rampage in the country’s second-largest city of Melbourne was inspired by Islamic State but did not have a direct link to the jihadist group, the government said Sunday. Hassan Khalif Shire Ali stabbed to death well-known local cafe co-owner Sisto Malaspina and injured two other men in Bourke Street in the heart of Melbourne on Friday afternoon before he was shot and killed by police. The 30-year-old had gone to the bustling city in a utility vehicle filled with gas cylinders before setting it alight. Islamic State said via its propaganda arm that Shire Ali was an “Islamic State fighter and carried out the operation”, but provided no evidence to back its claim. “In relation to his connections with ISIL (another name for IS) or with any terrorist group... there’s not, as I’m advised, a membership of an organization or a definite link to ISIL,” Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton told reporters in Brisbane. “The working theory is at the moment a case where this person has been downloading information or receiving messages in his own mind about what he should be doing. It’s inspired as opposed to affiliation or membership.” Shire Ali, known to the Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO), had his passport revoked in 2015 on fears he was trying to travel to Syria to join IS. But he was also assessed by authorities as not being a domestic threat. Dutton defended the actions of ASIO, saying they had more than 400 investigations and people of interest to monitor.“Police did not have intelligence in relation to this person that he was about to commit an act,” he added. “The fact is that many people, particularly where there is a low level of sophistication, where you have someone who can grab a knife from a kitchen drawer... it is impossible for authorities to cover every one of those circumstances.” Dutton’s comments came as Melbourne’s Herald Sun reported Sunday that Shire Ali had drug and alcohol problems, and had split from his wife and become distanced from his family. Melbourne’s The Age raised questions about his mental health, quoting a local imam as saying Shire Ali told him he was being “chased by unseen people with spears”. Meanwhile more than Aus$50,000 (US$36,000) has been raised on GoFundMe for a bystander dubbed “trolley man”, who was hailed as a hero for trying to stop Shire Ali by knocking him over with a shopping cart. The man, named in local media as Michael Rogers, is homeless according to the GoFundMe page creators. Authorities say more than a dozen terrorist attacks have been prevented in recent years, but several have taken place, including a cafe siege in Sydney in 2014 where two hostages were killed. Shire Ali’s brother will go on trial next year on separate terror-related charges?accused of trying to acquire a firearm and kill people in a New Years’ Eve crowd."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Melbourne knife attacker inspired by Islamic State, police say"	"MELBOURNE: A Somali-born man who set fire to a truck laden with gas cylinders in the centre of Melbourne and fatally stabbed one person was inspired by Islamic State but did not have direct links with the group, Australian police said on Saturday. Police identified the man responsible for Friday's attack as 30-year-old Hassan Khalif Shire Ali and said he was radicalised and inspired by the militant group's propaganda. He was shot by police and died in hospital. Police said Shire Ali's Australian passport was cancelled in 2015 after an intelligence report he planned to travel to Syria, but an assessment was made that while he had radical views, he posed no threat to national security. Islamic State had claimed responsibility for the attack, which came two days before Remembrance Day, marking 100 years since the end of World War One, without providing any evidence. ""I think it is fair to say he (Shire Ali) was inspired. He was radicalised,"" Australian Federal Police Acting Deputy Commissioner Ian McCartney told reporters in Melbourne. ""We're not saying there was direct contact. We're saying it was more from an inspiration perspective."" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the national terrorism advisory remained at ""probable"", the midpoint of a five-tier system, and told reporters in Sydney that radical Islam was the issue. ""I need to call it out. Radical, violent, extremist Islam that opposes our very way of life. I am the first to protect religious freedom in this country, but that also means I must be the first to call out religious extremism,"" he said. Friday's attack began just before the evening rush hour and lasted only minutes. Shire Ali stabbed bystanders and attacked police while his utility truck carrying barbecue gas cylinders burned on busy Bourke Street, (https://tmsnrt.rs/2Qu5stX) The cylinders did not explode and the fire was put out in 10 minutes, by which point the attack was over, though not before one man was fatally stabbed. Police said he was a 74-year-old man who worked in the city, but did not release his name. Local media identified him as a restaurant owner. ""This shouldn't happen in a city like Melbourne,"" one witness who had returned to the scene on Saturday told Reuters, crying. ""I just want to forget it,"" she said. Video posted to Twitter and broadcast on television showed Shire Ali swinging a knife at two police officers, while the truck burned in the background, before he collapsed when one shot him in the chest. Victoria state police said counter-terrorism investigators were searching two properties in suburban Melbourne in connection with the attack, but there was no immediate word on what the searches yielded. At one, a modest one-storey brick house on the city's western fringe, armed officers wearing masks stood guard outside. Bourke Street also reopened on Saturday morning, and a Reuters reporter said there was an increased police presence in the area. A staunch U.S. ally, Australia has been on alert for such violence after a Sydney cafe siege in 2014, and its intelligence agencies have stepped up scrutiny. Victoria Police Commissioner Graham Ashton said there was no warning of the latest attack. He said there was no longer a threat to the public, but that security would be boosted at horse races and Remembrance Day memorials over the weekend. Authorities say Australia's vigilance has helped foil at least a dozen plots, including a plan to attack Melbourne at Christmas in 2016 and a plan to blow up a flight from Sydney to Abu Dhabi using a bomb disguised as a meat mincer. Two hostages were killed during the 17-hour Sydney cafe siege by a ""lone wolf"" gunman who was inspired by Islamic State militants."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Paris knife attacker ‘born in Chechnya’	" PARIS?A knife-wielding man who killed a man and wounded four other people in a suspected terror attack in central Paris was born in Chechnya and his parents have been taken into custody, a judicial source said on Sunday. The young Frenchman, born in 1997 in the southern Russian republic according to the source, was shot dead by police after carrying out the assault on Saturday evening near the city’s main opera house. “He had no judicial record,” the judicial source told AFP. “[The attacker] is French, born in Chechnya in 1997. His father and mother were placed in custody Sunday morning.” Witnesses said they heard the attacker shout “Allahu akbar” (God is great) as Parisians fled into restaurants and bars after realizing another possible terror attack was underway in a country already reeling from a string of jihadist assaults that have killed more than 245 people in the last three years. “I was taking orders and I saw a young woman trying to get into the restaurant in panic,” Jonathan, a waiter at a Korean restaurant, told AFP. The woman was bleeding and a young man fended off the attacker who then ran away, he said. “The attacker entered a shopping street, I saw him with a knife in his hand,” he said. “He looked crazy.” Milan, 19, said he saw “several people in distress” including a woman with wounds to her neck and leg. “Firemen were giving her first aid. I heard two, three shots and a policeman told me that the man had been overpowered.” French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted: “France has once again paid the price in blood but will not give an inch to the enemies of freedom.” Authorities said a 29-year-old man was killed in the attack and that a terror investigation had been launched. The assailant had no identifying documents on him. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility, saying one of its “soldiers” had carried out the attack, according to the SITE monitoring group, but provided no corroborating proof to back their assertion. Two of those wounded, a 34-year-old man and a 54-year-old woman, were rushed to hospital in a serious condition but Interior Minister Gerard Collomb later told reporters all the injured would survive. “I have just seen the person who was most seriously injured, she is better, she is saved,” he said.French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said police were on the scene “within five minutes” of the attack and that some nine minutes later the assailant was dead, he added. “The speed of the response obviously avoided a heavier toll,” he said. A police source told AFP one officer tried to restrain the attacker with a taser but when that failed a colleague shot the man dead. The attack took place on Rue Monsigny in the second arrondissement, an area that lies between the main opera house and the Louvre museum, two major tourist attractions. Shocked tourists and residents looked on from behind a security perimeter set up by the police. “I was on the cafe terrace, I heard three, four shots, it happened very fast,” said 47-year-old Gloria. “The bartenders told us to come inside very quickly. Then I went out to see what was going on, and then I saw a man on the ground,” she added. One witness, who gave her first name as Maxine, said panic spread as word got out that an attack was taking place. “We saw someone coming out of a building who said he saw the assailant slaughter someone, so people took refuge in the bar,” she said. France has suffered a series of major Islamist attacks including the massacre at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, the November 2015 attacks that killed 130 in Paris, and the 2016 Bastille Day truck attack in Nice that killed more than 80. There have also been a string of less deadly but frequent attacks by lone wolf jihadists wielding knives or guns. Most of the attacks have either been claimed by the Islamic State group or been carried out in their name. A state of emergency put in place just after the 2015 Paris attacks was lifted in October when Macron’s centrist government passed a new law boosting the powers of security forces. Thousands of French troops remain on the streets under an anti-terror operation known as Sentinelle, patrolling transport hubs, tourist hot spots and other sensitive sites."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Finland knife attacker says he was ‘in war against women’	"HELSINKI, April 17 — A Moroccan man told a court in Finland he was “in war against women” when he went on a rampage in the Finnish city of Turku last year, stabbing two women to death and wounding eight more people, local media reported. Abderrahman Bouanane, at the time a 22-year-old asylum seeker, spoke in district court today, where he is on trial on charges of murder and attempted murder “with terrorist intent”. Bouanane told the court that before the attacks last August, he had visited mosque and recorded a video in which he talked about US-led air strikes in Syria and the fight for Islamic State. When he started the attacks on the market square, he said, he couldn’t control himself. “I honestly felt like I was controlled remotely... The idea was to keep attacking as long as a head falls,” Bouanane said via an interpreter, according to the newspaper Helsingin Sanomat’s online edition. Two women were killed and six more women were injured. Two men were hurt when they tried to help the women. Police stopped the attacks by shooting Bouanane in the leg. A psychiatric assessment concluded that Bouanane was criminally responsible for the attacks. Police said he was a “lone wolf” who saw himself as a soldier for Islamic State. The militant group did not take responsibility for the attack. “My target was to hit women, not men... I was in war against women,” Bouanane said, according to Helsingin Sanomat. The hearing was broke off today when Bouanane suddenly declined to sit in his chair or stand, without giving a clear reason. Bouanane had been radicalised shortly before the attack, police investigation showed, and his application for asylum had just been rejected. The case marks the first terror-related attack in Finland. The prosecutor is seeking a life sentence, which in Finland means at least 12 years in prison. Bouanane has admitted the attacks, but his defence has denied terrorist intent, according to the definition in Finnish law."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Australia PM, Muslim leaders spar over his terror comments"	"Australian Muslim leaders said Wednesday they would boycott a meeting with Prime Minister Scott Morrison after he said they needed to do more to halt terror attacks in the country. Morrison singled out Muslim community leaders as having a ""special responsibility"" to counter ""the radical and dangerous ideology of extremist Islam"" following a terror attack in Melbourne earlier this month that left two dead. ""They must be proactive, they must be alert and they must call this out,"" Morrison said, adding that he would hold a roundtable meeting with Muslim leaders this week to discuss the problem. But Australian Grand Mufti Ibrahim Abu Mohamed and a group of other senior Muslim figures rejected the invitation in an open letter to Morrison Wednesday. The men said they were ""deeply concerned and disappointed"" with comments by Morrison and other ministers ""which infer that the community is collectively culpable for the criminal actions of individuals and should be doing more to prevent such acts of violence"". ""These statements have achieved nothing to address underlying issues, but rather, have alienated large segments of the Muslim community,"" they said in the letter, which was published by Australian media. The letter prompted a tweetstorm from Morrison, who accused those behind the boycott of ""continuing down a path of denial"" and making their communities ""less safe and more vulnerable"". ""We all have responsibilities to make Australia safe, and that means making sure Muslim communities do not become infiltrated with this dangerous ideology,"" he tweeted. In the November 9 attack in Melbourne, a Somali-born man who police said was inspired by the so-called Islamic State, stabbed and killed one man and wounded two others before being fatally shot by police. And this week police arrested three more men in Melbourne for allegedly plotting another IS-inspired attack on the city -- the 15th terror attack authorities say they have thwarted since 2014. The terror threat has fuelled calls from some conservatives for a further toughening of Australia's already tight immigration laws, raising concerns among the Muslim community. In their letter the Islamic leaders, who head community groups in several Australian states, said they would attend a later meeting with Morrison if their ""views and concerns will be genuinely respected""."

Three men found guilty of Australia Christmas terror plot	"SYDNEY, Nov 14 — Three young men have been found guilty of plotting terror attacks in Australia’s second-largest city, intending to inflict mass casualties during the Christmas festive season. The court was told the men—Hamza Abbas, 23, Ahmed Mohamed, 25 and Abdullah Chaarani, 27 -- bought machetes and ingredients to make homemade bombs, and wanted to target major Melbourne sites including a train station and a church. The verdict came as Australians were reeling from last Friday’s Islamic State-inspired knife attack and attempted car bombing in Melbourne, which left two dead including the attacker. Hamza Abbas’ older brother Ibrahim Abbas pleaded guilty earlier this year to the Christmas plot, which was to be carried out in December 2016. The Supreme Court of Victoria jury decision was handed down in early November but only permitted to be published Wednesday after the lifting of suppression orders. Ibrahim Abbas had told the court he “wanted to make sure that the casualties would be high”, Melbourne’s Herald Sun reported. “The bigger the better. The bigger the more terror is achieved, and that’s the point.” Police uncovered the plot after monitoring the Australian-born men’s phone conversations, text messages and emails, and all four were arrested on December 22, 2016. Prosecutors had also alleged a link to the Al-Qaeda magazine Inspire’s article “How to make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom”, which was found on one of the men’s phones. Then Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called their plans “one of the most substantial terrorist plots that have been disrupted over the last several years”. Authorities say more than a dozen terrorist attacks have been prevented in recent years, but several have taken place, including a cafe siege in Sydney in 2014 where two hostages were killed. The men are due to be sentenced at a later date, and face life imprisonment."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Cash pours in for homeless ‘trolley man’ who battled terror attacker	" MELBOURNE, Nov 12 — Donations poured in this morning for a homeless man dubbed “trolleyman” for his attempt to use a shopping cart to halt last week’s deadly lone wolf terror attack in Melbourne. An online GoFundMe campaign set up to help Michael Rogers after video of his bid to stop Friday’s attack went viral surged past A$100,000 (RM301,248) this morning, more than double the target of A$45,000. As of early this morning, A$104,790 had been contributed to the fund by more than 3,700 people. “I was scared, I was scared for myself,” Rogers told Channel Seven television following the incident, when Hassan Khalif Shire Ali went on a stabbing rampage in central Melbourne, killing one man and wounding two others before being fatally shot by police. Video taken by passers-by shows Rogers repeatedly pushing a metal shopping cart toward Shire Ali as he wielded his knife against two policemen trying to subdue him. “I have seen the trolley to the side, so I’ve picked it up and I ran and threw the trolley straight at him,” Rogers said. “I did that motion ... quite a number of times, but it just wasn’t getting him down.” Rogers insisted he was “not a hero, but I feel that I’ve probably saved some lives, maybe.” Police said Shire Ali, a 30-year-old Somalia-born Australian, was inspired by the so-called Islamic State, but did not have a direct link to the jihadist group and seems to have acted on his own.

23 suspects of surabaya church bombing moved to Jakarta: Police	"Surabaya, E Java (ANTARA News) - Twenty three suspects of a church bombing in Surabaya have been moved from East Java city to the National Police headquarters` jail in Jakarta for an investigation, a police spokesman said. ""The suspects had been transported to Jakarta on Monday,"" the East Java police spokesman, Sen. Coms. Frans Barung Mangera, said here on Tuesday. Seventeen of the 23 suspects were jailed in the East Java provincial police detention house, while six others were detained in the prison of Dukuh Pakis police in Surabaya, he said, adding that they were transported to Jakarta in two buses. Arrested by the National Police anti-terrorist squad, Densus 88, the suspects would be tried in Surabaya because the attack occurred in the capital city of East Java Province, he said. The Surabaya church bombing occurred last May where the executor was a woman who engaged her two children. The three of them blew themselves up in the yard of the targeted church. The spread of radicalism and terrorism still threatens Indonesia, and the empowerment of women is believed to be an important element for resolving serious threats due to women`s strategic roles. It was Yenny Wahid, director of the Wahid Institute, who raised the importance of empowering women in the war against terrorism while speaking at the National Gathering of One Thousand Indonesian Women`s Organizations held in Yogyakarta recently. ""How do we feel when we see a mother have no heart and blow up herself and her two children? On the contrary, if our kids happen to even slip, we get sad. But the mother did it because her husband wanted them all to go to heaven. If she was strong, she would definitely be able to reject a doctrine that she would only go to paradise through her husband or her father,"" Wahid said. Indonesian women should be empowered enough to refuse such a misleading doctrine because each man and woman must be responsible for whatever he/she has done. ""The main task of a parent is to educate his or her children but if they have grown up and become adults, all the sins they commit are not the responsibility of the parents but their own."" ""What a pity if the parents of corruptors, criminals, and other bad people are held responsible for the sins of their children,"" Wahid said."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"British, Egyptian tourists among 7 wounded in Paris knife attack"	"PARIS • A man wielding a knife and an iron bar injured seven people, including three tourists, in Paris, in an attack that bystanders tried to stop by throwing petanque balls at the assailant. Four of the victims were in a critical condition, police said, after the man, believed to be an Afghan national, went on the rampage next to a canal in the north-east of the capital on Sunday evening. Two British tourists, an Egyptian tourist and a local man were among the injured, police added. The suspect, believed to be in his 30s, had been overpowered by bystanders and was unconscious when officers arrived on the scene and took him to hospital, police said. A source close to the inquiry added that though he had targeted foreigners, ""nothing at this stage suggests a terrorist attack"". Chaos erupted on the banks of the Bassin de la Villette, an area popular with locals and visitors, who frequent the cafes, cinemas and other cultural venues along its banks, just after 11pm local time. Eyewitness Youssef Najah, 28, said he was walking beside the canal when he saw a man running and holding a knife about 25-30cm long. ""There were around 20 people chasing him. They started throwing petanque balls at him,"" Mr Najah said, referring to the sport popular in France also known as boules. ""Around four or five balls hit him in the head, but they weren't able to stop him,"" he added. According to the same witness, the attacker then dived into an alleyway, where the man ""tried to hide behind two British tourists. We said to them: 'Watch out, he has a knife.' But they didn't react"". The pair, said by police to be in their 50s, were then attacked, he said. A security guard at one of two cinemas there said he had seen the attacker running away from two men who were trying to stop him. ""He had an iron bar in his hand, which he threw at the men chasing him, then he took out a knife,"" he told Agence France-Presse. An Algerian man identified as Smain told Le Parisien newspaper he was part of a group that apprehended the attacker. ""I managed to jump on him and throw him to the ground and get his weapon off him,"" he said. He added that the attacker sustained ""several blows from petanque balls, iron bars and sticks"" and ""looked drugged"". The UK foreign office said it was aware of reports of the attack and was ""urgently investigating this incident"" in cooperation with French authorities, British media reported. Interior Minister Gerard Collomb in a statement praised those who intervened to stop the attack for their ""responsiveness and courage"". A police investigation has been launched for attempted murder, according to a judicial source. It is the latest of several knife attacks France has seen in recent weeks. On Aug 23, a man stabbed his mother and sister to death and seriously injured another person in a town near Paris before being shot dead by police. The authorities said the 36-year-old had serious mental health problems and had been on a terror watch list since 2016. That attack came days after an Afghan asylum seeker was arrested in the south-western town of Perigueux for a drunken rampage with a knife in which four people were wounded. Police said investigators had ""very quickly"" dismissed a terrorist motive after the Aug 13 incident. And on June 17, two people were hurt in another southern town when a woman attacked them in a supermarket with a boxcutter knife. France has been on high alert following a string of terror attacks in recent years."	Terrorism	Terrorism

An Algerian man identified as Smain told Le Parisien newspaper he was part of a group that apprehended the attacker. “I managed to jump on him and throw him to the ground and get his weapon off him,” he said, adding that the attacker sustained “several blows from petanque balls, iron bars and sticks” and “looked drugged”. The UK foreign office said it was aware of reports of the attack and was “urgently investigating this incident” in cooperation with French authorities, British media reported. Interior Minister Gerard Collomb in a statement praised those who intervened to stop the attack for their “responsiveness and courage”. A police investigation has been launched for attempted murder, according to a judicial source. It is the latest of several knife attacks France has seen in recent weeks. On Aug 23, a man stabbed his mother and sister to death and seriously injured another person in a town near Paris before being shot dead by police. The motive for the violence remained unclear despite a claim by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) militant  group that it was an attack by one of its fighters responding to the terror organisation’s propaganda. Authorities said the 36-year-old had serious mental health problems and had been on a terror watch list since 2016. That attack came days after an Afghan asylum-seeker was arrested in the south-western town of Perigueux for a drunken rampage with a knife in which four people were wounded, one seriously. Police said investigators had “very quickly” dismissed a terrorist motive after the August 13 incident. And on June 17, two people were hurt in another southern town when a woman shouting “Allahu akbar” (God is greatest) attacked them in a supermarket with a boxcutter knife. France has been on high alert following a string of  terror attacks in recent years, often by people who have become radicalised or claim to have acted in the name of the ISIS group. More than 240 people have been killed by Islamist extremists since a massacre at the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine in Paris in January 2015."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Knife attack near Paris leaves two dead, one injured"	"PARIS • A man stabbed his mother and sister to death and seriously injured another person in a town near Paris yesterday before being shot dead by police. The killer had serious mental health problems and had been on a terror watch list since 2016, French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told reporters after visiting the scene in the town of Trappes. The motive for the violence remained unclear despite a claim by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group that it was an attack by one of its fighters responding to the terror organisation's propaganda. Mr Collomb said the attacker was ""mentally unstable, rather than someone who was committed, who would respond to orders from a terrorist organisation, in particular Daesh"", another name for ISIS. Regular French criminal prosecutors are investigating the case rather than anti-terror specialists, Mr Collomb stressed, although checks on the attacker's phone and computer were under way. ISIS claimed ""the person who carried out the attack in Trappes, south-west of Paris, was an Islamic State fighter"". ""He carried out the attack in response to calls to target subjects of the countries of the coalition"" fighting ISIS, said a statement on its propaganda channel Amaq. The leader of the extremist group Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had called on Muslims to wage ""jihad"" in a purported new audio recording released on Wednesday, in which he also called for attacks in the West. Experts have urged caution about recent ISIS announcements because it has lost credibility after claiming responsibility for seemingly unrelated violence as it faces defeat in the Middle East. The attacker in Trappes had been on the terror watch list after expressing extremist views, a security source told AFP. BFM television reported that he had serious alcohol and drug problems. Armed police responded to reports of violence and were threatened by the man who stabbed his mother to death in her home, said Mr Collomb. ""He walked towards the police with his knife,"" he said. ""Police then opened fire."" The assailant has not yet been named. Trappes, with a population of about 30,000, is known for its social problems linked to poverty, gangs and hardline interpretations of Islam. About 50 locals are suspected of having left France to fight for ISIS in Syria and Iraq, French security sources had previously told AFP. France remains on high alert after a string of militant attacks since 2015 that have claimed the lives of more than 240 victims. Baghdadi's Telegram message on Eid al-Adha, the Islamic festival of sacrifice, was the first purported recording of the ISIS leader to be released since last September. ISIS overran large swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq in 2014, proclaiming a ""caliphate"" in areas it controlled. But it has since lost most of that to various offensives in both countries. The ""caliphate will remain, God willing"", Baghdadi said in Wednesday's recording, addressing followers in the Middle East, Asia and Africa. It was not clear when the message was recorded, but Baghdadi appeared to criticise a US$100 million (S$137 million) pledge by Saudi Arabia last week to help rebuild Syria's north-east. He threatened the US and Russia, which have both backed offensives against ISIS, saying that militants had prepared ""horrors"" for them. The ISIS chief made his only known public appearance in Iraq's second city of Mosul in July 2014. Baghdadi has been dubbed the ""most wanted man on the planet"" and the US is offering a US$25 million reward for his capture."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Finland jails asylum seeker for life over country's first terror attack	" HELSINKI (AFP) - A Finnish court on Friday (June 15) sentenced a Moroccan asylum seeker to life in prison over what was described as the nation's first terror attack after he killed two women and injured eight others in a stabbing spree last year. The district court of South-western Finland found Abderrahman Bouanane guilty of two murders and eight attempted murders ""with terrorist intent"" in the southern Finnish city of Turku on the afternoon of August 18, 2017. The court said in its verdict that the 23-year-old swore allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria group (ISIS) in a video uploaded the night before the attack at a market place. The extremist group never claimed responsibility for the assault. Police shot the rejected asylum seeker in the thigh minutes after the attack at another square nearby, arresting him and confiscating his knife. The murders ""were strongly premeditated and committed in a particularly brutal and cruel way"", the court said, adding Bouanane ""was about to cut off the victim's head"". Authorities said he targeted women in the attack. Six of the total injured were women, while two men were wounded when they tried to fend off the attacker. Bouanane, who confessed to the killings, has 30 days to appeal the verdict. A life term in Finland averages 14 years, although the longest prison term has been 22 years. The court also ordered Bouanane to pay compensation to the survivors and to the victims' families, totalling more than 470,000 euros (US$546,000)."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Belgian police-killer had history of violence, petty crime"	"BRUSSELS, May 30 — Benjamin Herman, who shot three people dead in a suspected terror attack in eastern Belgium, was a serial petty criminal with a drug problem who may have been radicalised in prison. The 31-year-old Belgian was known to police since adolescence and had been in and out of prison for robbery and drug offences. Local media have portrayed him as a violent and unstable man. He is thought to have converted to Islam in prison but questions remain over whether he became radicalised there and whether this was what drove him to carry out his murderous rampage. “He converted to the Muslim religion in 2012 while meeting with another prisoner in Arlon,” a town in southern Belgium near Luxembourg, Justice Minister Koen Geens told broadcaster RTBF. But both Geens and Interior Minister Jan Jambon, interviewed on Belgium’s RTL channel, were cautious about whether he had embraced Islamist militant ideology before launching his attack. “The fact he took part in a prayer group, for example, is it a sufficient sign of radicalisation to treat him as a dangerous terrorist?” Geens asked. “We may have been mistaken, but the response was negative,” Geens added. “There were signs of radicalisation in prison but did this radicalisation lead to these actions? There, too, we can ask ourselves questions,” Jambon said. “We must wait for the results of the investigation.” Herman’s name appeared in police and state security reports about radicals, though he was not the subject of the reports. Prosecutors say they are treating the case as “terrorist murder and attempted terrorist murder”. That was partly because the method  of his attack has been advocated in online videos by the Islamic State group. Herman attacked police officers with a knife before taking their guns to shoot people. Alain Grignard, a Belgian Islamic studies expert at the University of Liege, said Herman appeared to be a “criminal who converted”. “People want labels that are too clear: ‘delinquent’, ‘terrorist’. The reality is between the two,” Grignard said. Herman’s first brush with the law was in 2003 when, aged 16, he was placed for several weeks in a juvenile home in the Flemish region of Everberg. Herman and his brother were both reported to be cocaine and heroin addicts. “Every day they hunted for money to get their fix,” the newspaper La Meuse reported. Herman was granted temporary release from prison on Monday morning for “family leave”. He embarked on his deadly spree instead of returning on Tuesday evening. In a separate investigation, prosecutors also suspect Herman killed another man on the eve of his rampage. Analysts say a high number of jihadists had trouble with the law before being radicalised. They include several involved in the November 2015 attacks in Paris and the March 2016 Brussels suicide bombings."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Psychiatrists to assess Jambi Police attacker	" Authorities are examining the mental state of a man who attacked officers with a knife at the Marosebo Police station in Jambi province on Tuesday evening. Anwar Sadat, 35, is being assessed by psychiatrists at the Jambi Regional Mental Health Hospital (RSJD), according to Jambi Police spokesperson Adj.Sr.Comr. Kuswahyudi Tresnadi. ""We believe that [Anwar] may be suffering from mental health issues, so we need to involve psychiatrists in our investigation,” he said on Wednesday, adding that the suspect was still being questioned. Preliminary investigations suggest that Anwar carried out the attack alone. ""He is the single perpetrator. Motives behind the attack are being investigated. [Anwar] has remained silent,"" Kuswahyudi said. Anwar is currently being detained at the Jambi Police's Mobile Brigade (Brimob) headquarters. According to police findings, he is unemployed but investigators have yet to discover whether he has been involved in other crimes. Meanwhile, Adj. Second Insp. Manalu and Chief Brig. Sangap Tinambunan who were wounded in the attack, are still being treated at the Jambi Bhayangkara Police Hospital. Both sustained stab wounds to the neck and hands, but their conditions are improving. Anwar arrived at the Marosebo Police station by motorcycle at 2 p.m. on Tuesday, then vandalized a police car before attacking officers. "	Terrorism	Terrorism
Suspected terror attack in France foiled	" PARIS (AFP) - Police in France have foiled a suspected terror attack and arrested two brothers of Egyptian origin, French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said on Friday (May 18). ""There were two young people of Egyptian origin who were preparing to commit an attack, with either explosives or ricin, this very powerful poison,"" the minister said on BFMTV. ""They had tutorials that showed how to make ricin-based poisons,"" Mr Collomb said, adding that they had communicated via the Telecom encrypted messaging app. The revelation came after a 29-year-old man was killed and five other people injured in a deadly knife attack in Paris last Saturday night. Mr Collomb did not indicate when they were arrested, but a source close to the inquiry said they were detained in the northern 18th Arrondissement of Paris on May 11, the day before Khamzat Azimov carried out his knife rampage. One of the men ""admitted having wanted to stage an attack"", the source told AFP. Azimov also lived in the 18th Arrondissement, parts of which are packed with low-income high-rises and a mix of French and immigrant communities. In late March, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe had indicated that a total of 51 attacks had been thwarted by French security services since January 2015, the beginning of a wave of strikes on French soil, many claimed by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group. A total of 246 people have been killed in attacks since then."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Friend of Paris knife attacker charged, two women held"	"PARIS (AFP) - A friend of the man who carried out a deadly knife attack in Paris was charged on Thursday (May 17) with ""associating with criminal terrorists"", while two women were detained for questioning as the investigation gathers speed. Khamzat Azimov, a 20-year-old naturalised Frenchman of Chechen origin, killed one man and injured five others in the busy Opera district of the French capital on Saturday night before being shot dead by police. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group has claimed the attack. Abdul Hakim A, also a Chechen-born French national, was detained on Sunday in the eastern city of Strasbourg, where the two men grew up, and charged with ""associating with criminal terrorists with plans to attack people"", a judicial source said. Both men, who were close friends, had appeared on French terror watch lists, although neither had a prior criminal record. ""He has denied any implication in either preparing or carrying out the acts as well as any recent links with Khamzat Azimov, claiming not to have seen or been in contact with him for several months,"" France's top anti-terror prosecutor Francois Molins said. But he added that examinations of telephone networks showed that shortly before the attack, Hakim A has sent his sister a text message of ""a jihadist chant regularly used by the Islamic State (in Iraq and Syria)"". Investigators want to determine if Hakim A ""may have influenced Azimov in his jihadist quest or knew he was planning this attack"", the source said. During a search of his home in Strasbourg, police found seven cellphones, but were unable to locate the phone he used most often, sources close to the case said. ""This telephone, he probably threw it away. He told investigators that he had gone to the gym and lost it there,"" Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told RTL radio on Wednesday. Mr Molins confirmed that two women were detained for questioning on Thursday in connection with the attack. Mr Molins said he did not want to give more details of the two women for now, but a source close to the inquiry said one was Ines Hamza, a radicalised 19-year-old who married Hakim A before trying to leave for Syria in January 2017. Witnesses said Azimov yelled ""Allahu akbar"" (God is greatest) during the rampage, for which the ISIS group has claimed responsibility, later releasing a video purporting to show Azimov pledging allegiance to the Islamists. Interior Minister Collomb said that Azimov had carried out his attack ""with one of his mother's kitchen knives"". Azimov's parents were released from custody on Tuesday after investigators found no incriminating elements during questioning. The attack brings to 246 the number of victims from a string of apparent Islamist strikes against French targets since 2015."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Three terror suspects from Probolinggo involved in Surabaya-Sidoarjo bombing attacks	"Probolinggo, E Java (ANTARA News) - Three terror suspects arrested by the Anti-Terror Special Detachment (Densus) 88 of the Indonesian Police were allegedly involved in the bombing attacks in Surabaya and Sidoarjo, both in East Java Province. Tens of Densus 88 personnel and Probolinggo Police raided three houses located in Wonoasih Sub-district in Probolinggo on Wednesday. ""Three male terror suspects identified by their initials as F, S, and H were arrested for interrogation,"" Head of the Probolinggo Police Adjunct Senior Commissioner Alfian Nurrizal informed the press here, Thursday. No violence broke out, as the three men did not resist arrest, he added. Several items seized during the raids at the three houses included guns, an arrow, a knife, machetes, books on jihad, communication devices, and electronic assemblies, he noted. The three suspects were taken to the Indonesian Police Headquarters in Jakarta for further investigation. Earlier, a series of bomb attacks hit three churches, a city police station in Surabaya, and a flat in Sidoarjo, East Java, on Sunday and Monday, killing at least 18 people and injuring dozens.

"Police detain more families linked to Surabaya, Sidoarjo bombings"	"Counterterrorism squad Densus 88 raided on Tuesday evening the residences of terror suspects believed to be linked to the recent bombings in Surabaya and Sidoarjo, East Java.  One suspect was killed during the raid, while two families comprising nine people were detained for further questioning. The police sought to apprehend Dedy Sulistiantono at his residence on Jl. Sikatan IV, Tandes, Surabaya. He is the younger brother of terror suspect Anton Ferdiantono whose wife and eldest son were killed after a bomb went off prematurely at his low-cost apartment in Wonocolo, Sidoarjo. Dedy, however, was shot dead after resisting arrest by attacking the officers with a knife. “We have detained [Dedy’s] wife and four children [for further investigation],” East Java Police spokesman Sr. Comr.

Parents of Paris knife attacker let out of custody	" PARIS (AFP) - French authorities released the parents of Paris knife attacker Khamzat Azimov from custody on Tuesday (May 15), while keeping his closest friend in detention, a judicial source said. Azimov, a naturalised French citizen of Chechen origin who had lived in Strasbourg, was shot dead by police on Saturday night after stabbing a 29-year-old man to death in the Opera district of Paris and wounding four others in an assault claimed by the Islamic State group. Azimov's parents were detained on Sunday morning. An apartment that his parents had rented in Paris was also searched. The attacker's close friend, named as Abdoul Hakim A., a 20-year-old of Chechen origin from Strasbourg, was retained in custody until Thursday. He was arrested by heavily armed, masked police on Sunday at his home in the eastern city. A source close to the inquiry told AFP he had been under surveillance since marrying Ines Hamza, a woman from the Paris region who tried to leave for Syria in January 2017. Police recovered seven cellphones during a search of his home but were unable to locate the main phone he used most often. Saturday's knife rampage followed a series of jihadist assaults that have now claimed 246 lives in France since 2015, including the Paris attacks of that year and the truck-ramming attack targeting Bastille Day revellers in Nice in 2016. A former student in Strasbourg told AFP that Azimov and Hakim A. were in the same class during their final year, ""and were very good friends, both Chechen - they were always together, both in school and outside."" Azimov's family later moved to Paris, where they were renting rooms in the 18th arrondissement. Azimov had been on both of France's main watchlists for suspected radicals since 2016 - the so-called ""S file"" and a more targeted File for the Prevention of Terrorist Radicalisation (FSPRT), which focuses on people judged to be terror threats. The government has come under fire over the fact that Azimov had been flagged as a suspected extremist, just the same as several others behind deadly attacks including the brothers who carried out the Charlie Hebdo gun massacre in 2015. Azimov became a French citizen in 2010 after his mother was naturalised. Hundreds of fighters from Chechnya have joined Islamist militant groups in recent years, following two bloody separatist wars against Russia. Amaq, the ISIS propaganda agency, released a video Sunday in which it claimed responsibility for the attack, with footage claiming to show Azimov pledging allegiance to the jihadist group. In Paris, witnesses said Azimov walked along stabbing people and yelling ""Allahu akbar"" (God is greatest). The seriously injured included a 34-year-old Chinese man who lives in Luxembourg and a 54-year-old woman. Two others were lightly wounded but all four are out of danger. The 29-year-old man who was killed has been identified as Ronan, whose neighbours in Paris's 13th arrondissement posted a letter announcing his death in the hall of their building. Erik Gouenard, a nearby restaurant owner, described him as ""discreet, quiet but always smiling. It was like a smile was part of his DNA."""	Terrorism	Terrorism
Chechnya-born man behind Paris knife attack	"PARIS • Police yesterday scoured the background of a Frenchman born in Russia's Chechnya region who went on a knife attack in central Paris, as the government said the 21-year-old had been flagged previously as a potential security risk. The assailant shouted ""Allahu akbar"" (""God is greatest"") as he stabbed a 29-year-old man to death and wounded four others, among them a Chinese and a Luxembourg citizen, before police shot him dead on Saturday. The attack took place in the busy Opera district, known for its many restaurants, cafes and the Palais Garnier opera. It was one of a succession of attacks in France in which more than 240 people have died since January 2015, keeping the country on high alert. The attacker was named by official sources as Khamzat A. He grew up with his family in the eastern city of Strasbourg, home to a large community of refugees from Chechnya, a Muslim republic. He obtained French citizenship in 2010. Since 2016, he had been on a counter-terrorism watchlist of suspected radicals, said government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux. The stabbing exposed once again the difficulty European intelligence services face in keeping track of suspected extremists and countering the threat posed by home-grown militants and foreign extremists. France is part of a US-led coalition fighting the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and has thousands of soldiers in West Africa, where militants linked to Al-Qaeda are active. French academic Mathieu Guidere, an expert on Islamist terrorism, said the attack could have been planned by Chechen extremists. Over the past 20 years, Russia has fought two fierce wars with separatists in Chechnya, leading to the radicalisation of the territory and beyond. Radical groups see Muslims in the Russian Caucasus and Central Asia, who still face discrimination and harsh treatment by the authorities, as potential recruits. Chechen warlord Akhmed Chatayev, who was killed last year, was believed to be behind a 2016 attack at Istanbul's Ataturk airport in which 45 people died. ""The priority target for Chechens is not Westerners. From this point of view, (the Paris attack) is something of a turning point because up to now, Chechen propaganda has been focused on 'kill all the Russians' rather than 'kill Westerners',"" Mr Guidere told Agence France-Presse. The reprise could be linked ""to (Chechen Islamists') inability to carry out serious actions against the Russians in Syria or Russia, which makes the Islamic State group decide to use them against Westerners instead"", he added. President Emmanuel Macron said France would ""not yield an inch to the enemies of freedom"". A judicial source said the assailant's parents were being held for questioning. Police also arrested and held for questioning a friend of the attacker in Strasbourg. France bears ""full responsibility"" for the knife attack, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said yesterday. He identified the assailant as Hassan Azimov. ""He may have been born in Chechnya, but he grew up and formed his personality, his opinions and convictions within French society,"" said Mr Kadyrov."

Terror cops seek ID of Paris knife attacker	" PARIS, May 13 — French investigators scrambled today to identify a knifeman who killed one person and wounded four others in a suspected terror attack that brought panic once more to the streets of Paris. An assailant shouting “Allahu akbar” was shot dead by police in central Paris late yesterday, minutes after he attacked people near the city’s main opera house — an area full of bars, restaurants and theatres which were brimming on a weekend night. Witnesses described scenes of panic as Parisians realised another potential terror attack was underway in a country already reeling from a string of jihadist assaults in the last three years that have killed more than 245 people. “I was taking orders and I saw a young woman trying to get into the restaurant in panic,” Jonathan, a waiter at a Korean restaurant, told AFP. The woman was bleeding and the attacker appeared behind her. He said a young man tried to fend off the assailant who then fled. “The attacker entered a shopping street, I saw him with a knife in his hand,” he said. “He looked crazy.” Milan, 19, said he saw “several people in distress” including a woman with wounds to her neck and leg. “Firemen were giving her first aid. I heard two, three shots and a policeman told me that the man had been overpowered.” In a tweet French President Emmanuel Macron said: “France once again pays the price of blood.” Authorities cited witnesses as saying the man shouted “Allahu akbar” (God is greatest) as he went on the rampage, killing a 29-year-old man, adding that a terror investigation had been launched. The assailant had no identifying documents on him. A source with knowledge of the case told AFP he was a young man with brown hair and a beard who was dressed in black tracksuit trousers. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility, according to the SITE monitoring group, but provided no corroborating proof to back their assertion. “The executor of the stabbing operation in the city of Paris is a soldier of the Islamic State and the operation was carried out in response to the calls to target the coalition states,” a “security source” told IS’s official Amaq news agency, according to SITE. Two of those wounded were rushed to hospital in a serious condition but Interior Minister Gerard Collomb later told reporters all the victims were out of danger and would survive their injuries. “I have just seen the person who was most seriously injured, she is better, she is saved,” he said. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said police were on the scene “within five minutes” of the attack and that some nine minutes later the assailant was dead, he added. “The speed of the response obviously avoided a heavier toll,” he said. A police source told AFP one officer tried to restrain the attacker with a taser but when that failed a colleague shot the man dead. The attack took place on Rue Monsigny in the second arrondissement, an area that lies between the main opera house and the Louvre museum, two major tourist attractions. A large area was cordoned off where police, fire and rescue vehicles converged. Shocked tourists and residents looked on from behind the security perimeter. “I was on the cafe terrace, I heard three, four shots, it happened very fast,” said 47-year-old Gloria. “The bartenders told us to come inside very quickly. Then I went out to see what was going on, and then I saw a man on the ground,” she added. One witness, who gave her first name Maxine, said panic spread as word got out that an attack was taking place. “We saw someone coming out of a building who said he saw the assailant slaughter someone, so people took refuge in the bar,” she said. France has suffered a series of major Islamist attacks including the massacre at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, the November 2015 attacks that killed 130 in Paris, and the 2016 Bastille Day truck attack in Nice that killed more than 80. There have also been a string of less deadly but frequent attacks by lone wolf jihadists wielding knives or guns. Most of the attacks have either been claimed by the Islamic State group or been carried out in their name. A state of emergency put in place just after the 2015 Paris attacks was lifted in October when Macron’s centrist government passed a new law boosting the powers of security forces. Thousands of French troops remain on the streets under an anti-terror operation known as Sentinelle, patrolling transport hubs, tourist hotspots and other sensitive sites."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Indonesian police arrest 2 women planning to stab officers using scissors	"JAKARTA - Police have arrested two young women who planned to attack police officers by stabbing them using sharp steel scissors, two days after a militant believed to be a lonewolf stabbed an officer to death. Dita Siska Millenia, 18, and Siska Nur Azizah, 22, were arrested on Saturday (May 12) after police received a tip-off that they were descending on the country's Police Mobile Brigade (Brimob) headquarters, which has a detention facility that saw a dramatic two-day siege earlier this week. ""They are being interrogated,"" Brigadier General Muhammad Iqbal, a police spokesman, told news portal Jawapos.com late on Saturday evening. Police did not provide further details on the arrests. The Straits Times understands that the occupation listed on the suspects' IDs is 'unemployed' and their marital status is single. Police learnt that at least 50 militants were heading to Brimob headquarters from Pekanbaru (Riau province), Tegal (Central Java province), and several places of West Java province, including Karawang, Cirebon, Indramayu, and Tasikmalaya, a source told The Straits Times. On Thursday night, a 22-year-old man identified as Tendi Sumarno, a student, pulled a knife and killed a police intelligence officer near the detention centre before he was shot by the police. The detention facility in the Kelapa Dua area, just 25km from the city centre of Jakarta, housed a number of Islamist militants jailed on terror-related charges. All of them were transferred to the Nusakambangan prison island in Central Java province on Thursday. Five police officers and an inmate were killed in a two-night stand-off involving more than 150 inmates at the centre. The rioting inmates, supporters of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), held police officers hostage during the 36-hour siege, killing and torturing the five police officers. Another four officers were injured. The standoff started on Tuesday night and ended only on Thursday morning after the police mounted a raid. Police spokesman Setyo Wasisto on Friday told reporters that police arrested four militants in Bekasi, West Java, at 1.35am on Thursday morning, after a tip-off that they were heading to Brimob headquarters to join forces with the rioting inmates in Kelapa Dua. As the four militants, in handcuffs, were being taken to Jakarta, two of them made an attempt to escape. One of them strangled an officer and tried to snatch his pistol but failed, Inspector-General Setyo said. The two inmates were shot by the officers and one of them died in hospital. The four were members of the Bandung, West Java, chapter of the Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) terrorist group, which is affiliated to ISIS."	Terrorism	Terrorism
 Terror probe launched after deadly Paris knife attack	"PARIS, May 13 — A  knifeman shouting “Allahu akbar” was shot dead by police in central Paris late yesterday after he killed one person and injured four, prompting a terror probe. The attack took place near the city’s main opera house in an area full of bars, restaurants and theatres which were brimming on a weekend night. French President Emmanuel Macron said: “France once again pays the price of blood.” Yesterday’s assault is the latest to strike a nation rocked by a series of jihadist attacks in the last three years that have killed more than 245 people. Prosecutors cited witnesses as saying the man shouted “Allahu akbar” (God is greatest) as he went on the rampage, and added that a terror investigation had been launched. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility, according to the SITE monitoring group, but provided no corroborating proof. “The executor of the stabbing operation in the city of Paris is a soldier of the Islamic State and the operation was carried out in response to the calls to target the coalition states,” a “security source” told IS’s official Amaq news agency, according to SITE. The man, who has not yet been named, attacked five people with a knife, one of whom died, police said. Two were in serious condition and all the victims are in hospital. A police source told AFP one officer tried to restrain the attacker with a taser but when that failed a colleague shot the man dead. Interior Minister Gerard Collomb hailed in a tweet the “sang-froid and reaction of the police who neutralised the attacker”. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, who visited police in the district where the attack took place, added: “France is determined not to give in to threats that the attackers hope will grind her (the country) down.” The attack took place on Rue Monsigny in the 2nd arrondissement, an area that lies between the main opera house and the Louvre museum, two major tourist attractions. A large area was cordoned off where police, fire and rescue vehicles converged. Shocked tourists and residents looked on from behind the security perimeter. “I was on the cafe terrace, I heard three, four shots, it happened very fast,” said 47-year-old Gloria. “The bartenders told us to come inside very quickly. Then I went out to see what was going on, and then I saw a man on the ground,” she added. Another witness, who gave her first name Maxine, said panic spread as word got out that an attack was taking place. “We saw someone coming out of a building who said he saw the assailant slaughter someone, so people took refuge in the bar,” she said. France has suffered a series of major Islamist attacks including the massacre at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, the November 2015 attacks that killed 130 in Paris, and the 2016 Bastille Day truck attack in Nice that killed more than 80. There have also been a string of less deadly but frequent attacks by lone wolf jihadists wielding knives or guns. Most of the attacks have either been claimed by the Islamic State group or been carried out in their name. A state of emergency put in place just after the 2015 Paris attacks was lifted in October when Macron’s centrist government passed a new law boosting the powers of security forces. “The French people will no longer be content with talk, they expect action,” she said. Thousands of French troops remain on the streets under an anti-terror operation known as Sentinelle, patrolling transport hubs, tourist hotspots and other sensitive sites."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Paris knife attack suspect was on extremist watchlist	"PARIS (AFP) - The knifeman who killed one man and wounded four other people Saturday (May 12) night in Paris had been on an anti-terror watchlist of suspected extremists, sources close to the inquiry told AFP on Sunday. The Frenchman, born in 1997 in the Russian republic of Chechnya, was on the so-called “S file” of people suspected of radicalised views who could pose security risks, the sources said, though he did not have a criminal record. Police shot and killed the man shortly after being alerted to the attack on the Rue Monsigny, a lively neighbourhood of theatres and restaurants near the main opera house in Paris. One of the five people he attacked later died, police said. Two were in serious condition and all the victims are in hospital. Witnesses said they heard the man yelling “Allahu akbar” (God is greatest) as people fled the scene.  His parents have been taken into custody. Investigators have not yet said when the man arrived in France. Many but not all of the people on France’s S file (the ‘S’ stands for security) have been involved in the series of deadly jihadist attacks that have killed some 245 people across the country since 2015. The watchlist contains anyone suspected of being a radical, including potentially dangerous religious extremists but also leftist and far-right activists. A separate list, the File for the Prevention of Terrorist Radicalisation (FSPRT), focuses on people judged to be terror threats.  That list currently has nearly 20,000 people, of whom about half are under active surveillance. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group has claimed responsibility for Saturday's attack, according to the SITE monitoring group. “The executor of the stabbing operation in the city of Paris is a soldier of the Islamic State and the operation was carried out in response to the calls to target the coalition states,” a “security source” told ISIS' official Amaq news agency, according to SITE. French President Emmanuel Macron said: ""France once again pays the price of blood."" Prosecutors said a terror investigation had been launched. Interior Minister Gerard Collomb hailed in a tweet the ""sang-froid and reaction of the police who neutralised the attacker."" A large area was cordoned-off where police, fire and rescue vehicles converged. Shocked tourists and residents looked on from behind the security perimeter. ""I was on the cafe terrace, I heard three, four shots, it happened very fast,"" said 47-year-old Gloria. ""Then the bartenders told us to come inside very quickly. Then I went out to see what was going on, and then I saw a man on the ground,"" she added. Police said the attacker's motives were still unknown. The attack comes as France is under a constant threat from terrorism. A string of militant attacks have claimed the lives of over 245 people around France in the past three years."

Teenager on trial for UK terror plot with fairy tale code words	" LONDON, May 11 — A trial began yesterday of a teenage girl accused of plotting a terror attack in London from behind bars using the guise of an Alice in Wonderland themed tea party. Safaa Boular was aged 17 when she allegedly schemed with her sister to launch assaults in the British capital in April, 2017. She began plotting after failing the year before to join her then-fiance Naweed Hussain, a member of the Islamic State group subsequently killed in Syria, the court heard. While in custody for allegedly trying to travel to IS territory, she encouraged her elder sister Rizlaine Boular to carry on with the plot, jurors were told. In calls from jail, she talked with her 21-year-old sibling about arranging an “Alice In Wonderland” themed tea party, which prosecutors said was code for an attack. The duo also referenced a “Mad Hatter” and “pineapples”, other code words in the plot, they added. During their investigation members of the security services posed as IS fighters online to engage with the pair and track their activities. Safaa Boular, now 18, told one officer that all she needed was a “car and a knife to get what I want to achieve”, jurors were told. Prosecutors said the sisters and their mother Mina Dich, 43, had carried out reconnaissance around major landmarks in Westminster and purchased a pack of knives and a rucksack. The trio were arrested on April 27 last year in raids by counter-terrorism police, during which Rizlaine Boular was shot. She has since pleaded guilty to terrorism offences. Safaa Boular, who lived at home with her mother in southwest London, has denied two counts of preparing acts of terrorism. Her defence lawyer Joel Bennathan told jurors that she had been “groomed” by Hussain, who was twice her age, and that her family had “encouraged” and “celebrated” it. "	Terrorism	Terrorism
German police foil Berlin half-marathon attacks	"BERLIN, April 8 — German police have detained four men, one of whom they suspect of planning knife attacks at today’s Berlin half-marathon, the newspaper Die Welt reported in its online edition. Die Welt said the four suspects were linked to Anis Amri, a Tunisian man with Islamist militant ties who killed 12 people in an attack in Berlin in December 2016 when he hijacked a truck and drove it into a crowded marketplace. Berlin police were not immediately available for comment. In its unsourced report Die Welt said the main suspect was known to Amri and had planned to stab to death spectators and runners at the half marathon. The suspect had in his possession two knives which had been especially sharpened for this purpose, the report said. Amri’s attack in Berlin in 2016 had prompted German lawmakers to call for tougher security measures. No major Islamist militant attack has been carried out in Germany since. Earlier today, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said the government would do everything possible to protect citizens, but added: “We have again experienced that ... absolute security is unfortunately not possible.” Seehofer was speaking in Muenster, where a man drove a camper van into a group of people sitting outside a restaurant on Saturday, killing two of them before shooting himself dead. Authorities have said the attacker was a 48-year-old German citizen with mental health problems and that there was no indication of an Islamist militant connection."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Sword-wielding attacker in Yogyakarta church shot by police	"JAKARTA  -  A sword-wielding man who went on a rampage in a church in Yogyakarta was shot and wounded by local police on Sunday (Feb 11). Three members of the St Lidwina Bedog church in Sleman District, as well as a police officer responding to the incident, were injured as a result of the attack. Witnesses said the attacker charged in through the main entrance of the church, hurting a member of the parish before heading towards the altar in the middle of Sunday Mass. He also destroyed statues of Jesus and the Virgin Mary during the attack, which lasted about 15 minutes before police arrived at the scene. A member of the congregation Andhi Cahyo was quoted as saying that soon after the service started, a fellow member whose head was bleeding ran into the church chased by the man. “Everybody started panicking and screaming. I was scrambling to save my wife and children,” Mr Cahyo was quoted as saying by Agence France-Presse. He said that when the police arrived, they fired a warning shot but the attacker refused to surrender. The attacker charged at one of the officers with his sword and was shot. But he somehow managed to injure the officer before being subdued, Mr Cahyo added. All four people hurt in the attack, including parish head, Father Karl-Edmund Prier, were taken to hospital where they were treated for their injuries. District police chief Muhammad Firman Lukmanul Hakim said the suspect, who suffered gunshot wounds to his legs, is being held at Bhayangkara Hospital, where he is also being treated. The police, who identified him as university student Suliono from Bayuwangi in East Java, are trying to establish where he lived in Yogyakarta. The city, located about 500km south-east of Jakarta, is regarded as the cultural heart of Java, Indonesia’s main island. The incident sparked fears of a terrorist attack on the church, but police said investigations were ongoing. Similar incidents have occurred in Indonesia in recent years. In August 2016, a knife-wielding assailant attacked a priest, also during Sunday service, at the St Joseph Catholic church in Medan, North Sumatra. Three months later, a church in Samarinda, East Kalimantan was struck by a home-made bomb which injured four people."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Knife-wielding attacker wounds four church-goers in Indonesia	"JAKARTA, Feb 11 — A knife-wielding attacker wounded four church-goers in the Indonesian city of Yogyakarta today, officials said, before being shot by police who could not yet confirm if it was a terror-related incident. Police said they were investigating possible motives for the attack by the suspect, believed to be a university student, at a Catholic church service in Yogyakarta, the gateway to the cultural centre of Indonesia’s main island of Java. “We cannot confirm yet if this was a terror-related incident,” said Yogyakarta police spokesman Yuliyanto, who goes by one name like many Indonesians. “We can confirm the suspect has been detained and is being treated at hospital.” Yuliyanto said the unidentified attacker had been shot in the stomach by police. The condition of the wounded church-goers was not immediately clear. Indonesia is an officially secular country and has the world’s largest population of Muslims, as well as sizeable minorities of Christians, Hindus, and those who adhere to traditional faiths. Communal and religious tensions have been on the rise in recent years as calls by hardline groups for sharia, or Islamic law, to be implemented nationally grow louder. Indonesia has also seen a resurgence in homegrown radicalism, inspired in part by the militant Islamic State group."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Malaysia arrests two ISIS militants over planned attacks on police stations and Buddhist monks	" KUALA LUMPUR (REUTERS, THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - Malaysia has arrested two men believed to have links with militant group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), including one who allegedly walked around its capital armed with a knife aiming to kill Buddhist monks, police said on Monday (Jan 22). The Muslim-majority South-east Asian nation has been on high alert since gunmen linked to ISIS launched several attacks in Jakarta, the capital of neighbouring Indonesia, in Jan 2016. The two suspects were arrested in two separate raids in December and January, on suspicion of planning to carry out acts of violence and promoting ISIS ideology. One of them, a 23-year-old Indonesian who was arrested last week on Jan 17, had allegedly scoured a busy district of the capital, Kuala Lumpur, in November, seeking Buddhist monks to kill, in retaliation for violence suffered by Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. ""The attempt failed, and police managed to confiscate a knife during the raid,"" Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi Harun, the inspector-general of police, said in a statement. The suspect had planned to attack the federal police headquarters in Bukit Aman as well as the Travers police station. He added that the suspect had also allegedly communicated with a senior ISIS leader over WhatsApp, had sought to recruit several other Indonesians and put up an ISIS flag at the building site where he worked. The other suspect, a 25-year-old Malaysian teacher at a private religious school, was detained in Dec on suspicion of planning an attack on entertainment outlets and to rob, kidnap or kill non-Muslims. The suspect, who had been previously jailed under Malaysia's anti-terror law, had also maintained contact with former members of known terror groups and promoted ISIS ideology on his Facebook account to recruit new members, police said. Separately,  the Kuala Lumpur High Court on Monday sentenced a former factory supervisor to eight years in jail for attempting to go to Syria with intent to commit terrorist acts. Mohamad Awang, 42, was arrested in Kuala Lumpur on Feb 21 last year with a flight ticket, an international passport, a handphone and several SIM cards in his possession. He had planned to go to Syria via Teheran. Malaysia has arrested hundreds of people over the past few years for suspected links to militant groups. A grenade attack on a bar on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur in June 2016 wounded eight people. ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, the first such incident on Malaysian soil. Mr Fuzi also said in a statement on Monday that police will be ramping up security during the Hindu celebration of Thaipusam on Jan 31. ""Police will be increasing security measures in all locations across the country to prevent untoward incidents that could disrupt the event,"" he said."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Truck attack against Swedish 'infidels' planned for months: Prosecutors	"STOCKHOLM (AFP) - A 39-year-old Uzbek asylum seeker who confessed to an April 2017 Stockholm truck attack that killed five people planned his assault ""against infidels"" in Sweden for months, prosecutors said on Tuesday (Jan 30). Rakhmat Akilov, who swore allegiance to Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) prior to the attack, has admitted to stealing a truck and mowing down a crowd of people on a pedestrian street on a Friday afternoon. Prosecutors formally charged him on Tuesday with ""terrorism and attempted terrorism"". Akilov wanted to ""instigate fear among the public in Sweden and force Sweden's government and parliament to end Sweden's participation in military training of the global coalition against ISIS in Iraq,"" the indictment said. ISIS has, however, never claimed responsibility for the attack. Arrested a few hours after the assault thanks to video surveillance images, Akilov confessed to police the next day. The prosecution said it would present as evidence excerpts of Akilov's chat conversations concerning his ""willingness to carry out a terror attack"" and his ""desire to join ISIS"". In one chat, Akilov asked for help ""to carry out a crime, he wanted to run down infidels (because) Sweden supports Nato and sends bomb technicians to Iraq and train Kurds,"" the indictment read. Prosecutors, who will argue Akilov acted alone, will also present two videos recorded on the eve of the attack in which Akilov swore allegiance to ISIS. It was still not known why Akilov became radicalised, but ""he wasn't radicalised right before the attack,"" prosecutor Hans Ihrman said. The prosecution plans to present as evidence Akilov's chat texts dating back to January 2017, photos of the area taken with his smartphone ahead of the attack and Internet searches for possible targets and bomb materials on his computer. After crashing the truck into the facade of a department store, Akilov set off an explosive device in the cab of the truck made up of five butane gas canisters, screws, knife blades and metal objects, causing damage to the truck but no injuries, prosecutors said. He then fled the scene. ""His motive was to punish Sweden for its participation in the war against ISIS,"" prosecutor Hans Ihrman told reporters. Akilov's lawyer Johan Eriksson told reporters his client would explain his motives further during the trial. ""He admits committing a terrorist act"" and ""admits that he should be convicted"" and expelled from Sweden after serving his sentence, Eriksson said, adding that Akilov had not expected to survive the attack. ""He thought he would be shot or would die."" The Stockholm district court announced on Tuesday that the trial would start on Feb 13. A construction worker, Akilov had gone underground after his application for Swedish residency was rejected in 2016, police said last year. Three Swedes, including an 11-year-old girl, a 41-year old British man, and a 31-year-old Belgian woman were killed in the attack. Around 10 others were injured. Similar assaults with vehicles have taken place in Europe in recent years, including Berlin, London and the southern French city of Nice, where 86 people were killed and more than 400 were injured on July 14, 2016. That attack was claimed by ISIS."	Terrorism	Terrorism
 Six Africans injured in ‘racial’ drive-by shooting spree in Italy	" MACERATA, Feb 4 — A shaven-headed far-right supporter suspected of wounding six Africans yesterday in brazen drive-by shootings in central Italy was arrested, as the country’s interior minister said “racial hatred” had prompted the attack. After the morning assault in the town of Macerata, the suspect got out of his car, allegedly made a fascist salute with a tricolour Italian flag draped over his shoulders and shouted “Viva Italia”, or “Long Live Italy”, and “Italy for Italians,” media reports said. The wounded included five men and one woman from Ghana, Mali and Nigeria, the Agi news agency said. It came a day after a Nigerian man was arrested in the town over the gruesome murder of a teenage Italian girl. Interior Minister Marco Minniti said the attack was part of a culture “of right-wing extremism with clear reference to fascism and Nazism” and deplored that the sole link between the victims was “the colour of their skin”. He said the “criminal act” was “prepared in advance”. The man allegedly opened fire in eight areas in the town and also targeted the office of the centre-left Democratic Party in a two-hour terror spree in the sleepy town of 43,000 people, press reports said. “Six people were injured and all of them are foreigners,” said town mayor Romano Carancini. Police confirmed in a tweet that “the wounded persons were of foreign nationality”, adding that the “presumed author of the attack is Italian”. One victim was seriously injured in the thorax, press reports said. The other five had lesser injuries. A Nigerian man who was shot in the thigh while buying cigarettes on the street, telling a television channel from his hospital bed that he was in great pain, adding: “It’s very serious.” Television footage showed the suspect being arrested at the town’s war memorial. Police also posted a photo of the capture. Authorities identified the suspected shooter as Luca Traini, 28. He is a member of the far-right anti-immigration Northern League party and had run in local elections last year. Media reports said police found a gun in the man’s vehicle, a black Alfa Romeo. “Someone who shoots is a delinquent, irrespective of the colour of his skin,” said Northern league chief Matteo Salvini, in full campaign mode ahead of legislative elections on March 4. “I’m in a hurry to be in government to bring back security, social justice and serenity to Italy,” he said. Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni meanwhile made a pitch for unity, saying: “Hate and violence will not divide us.” The attack comes a day after a Nigerian asylum-seeker and drug dealer was arrested in Macerata over the gruesome killing of an 18-year-old Italian woman whose dismembered body was discovered in suitcases earlier this week. Police found the clothes of the victim, Pamela Mastropietro, in the house of the 29-year-old Nigerian as well as a bloodstained knife. However, no official link has been made between the two incidents. Italians head to the polls in national elections next month, with immigration shaping up to be a key issue. The country is a favoured landing point on Europe’s southern coastline for migrants making the perilous journey across the Mediterranean, often aboard unseaworthy boats, to enter the continent. But 2017 was a turning point for Italy: the country went from large-scale arrivals in the first six months to a sharp drop-off, thanks to controversial agreement between the EU and Libya. Some 119,000 people landed in Italy last year, down 35 percent on 2016. The Northern League is part of a populist coalition tipped to do well in the elections. According to opinion polls, the alliance between ex-prime minister Silvio Berlusconi’s centre-right Forza Italia (Go Italy), the post-fascist Fratelli d’Italia (Italian Brothers) and the Northern League leads with more than 35 percent ahead of the March 4 vote."

Three men charged with supplying gun to Strasbourg market attacker	"Three men were Friday charged with supplying the weapon used by the gunman in the Christmas market attack in the French city of Strasbourg and placed in pre-trial detention, a judicial source said. The three suspects, from the same family and aged 32, 34 and 78, were indicted by an examining magistrate in Paris for “possession and transfer of a category B weapon in relation to a criminal terrorist enterprise” and for “conspiracy with terrorist criminals”, according to the source. They are alleged to have supplied an 8mm pistol used by Cherif Chekatt, a small-time criminal who shot dead five people and wounded 11 during the December 11 attack on the open-air Christmas market. The three men were arrested Tuesday in eastern France along with two other members of the family, who were released from custody Wednesday evening without being charged. The three suspects were transferred Thursday from Strasbourg to the counter-terrorism bureau in Levallois-Perret, near Paris. On December 17, another man, a relative of the killer, was also arrested and charged on the same counts. Anti-terrorist police believe Chekatt had obtained the firearm — an 8mm pistol — a few days before the attack. Chekatt, 29, who was on a special watchlist as a suspected radical Islamist, was shot dead by police after a two-day manhunt in the city on the German border. Judicial sources said Chekatt had pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group in a video found on a USB key. The interior minister has dismissed a claim by the Islamic State group that it was responsible for the attack. France has been on high alert since the start of a wave of jihadist attacks in 2015 which have killed 251 people."	Terrorism	Terrorism

One killed in Paris knife attack by man shouting 'Allahu akbar'	"PARIS: An assailant shouting ""Allahu akbar"" killed a passer-by in a knife attack that also wounded four others in the heart of Paris late on Saturday before he was shot dead by police, French authorities said. The country has been on high alert amid a series of attacks, commissioned or inspired by the Islamic State militant group, that has killed more than 240 people since 2015. France ""will not yield an inch to the enemies of freedom,"" President Emmanuel Macron said after the attack, praising officers for ""neutralizing the terrorist."" The first call to police was placed at 8:47 p.m. local time (1847 GMT), officers were on the scene within five minutes, and the attacker was ""neutralized"" within nine minutes of that first call, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told reporters. Police union representative Rocco Contento told Reuters that the assailant, after attacking bystanders with a knife, rushed at police shouting ""I will kill you, I will kill you!"" He was then shot by the officers. The attack took place in the heart of the French capital in a district popular with tourists for its many restaurants and cafes, landmark retail stores, and the Paris opera. Prosecutor Francois Molins told reporters the police's anti-terrorism unit would launch an investigation, given the aggressor's ""mode of operation."" The identity of the attacker man was not yet known, officials said early on Sunday. A picture seen by Reuters, which a source said showed the attacker, showed a bare-chested and bearded young man dressed in black trousers. The Islamic State claimed responsibility via its Amaq news agency, but provided no proof for its claim. Witnesses described for French media how they saw the assailant running towards police officers who shot him. ""We were told to get into a bar quickly. I was curious and went outside again. Outside, I saw a person on the ground about 200 metres from me. The police, fire brigade and ambulance arrived,"" one female witness told LCI television. ""I could not see anything else after that."" Authorities did not immediately reveal the identity of the victim."	Terrorism	Terrorism
French police quiz radicalised girlfriend of supermarket gunman	"PARIS, March 27 — French investigators yesterday quizzed the radicalised girlfriend of the Islamist gunman who shot dead four people last week in southern France, including a heroic policeman killed after taking the place of a hostage. Policeman Arnaud Beltrame was the fourth person killed during Radouane Lakdim’s rampage in the towns of Carcassonne and Trebes that also left three people injured. Beltrame’s mother Nicole said she was not surprised that her 44-year-old son offered to be swapped for a woman held hostage by Lakdim at a supermarket in the sleepy town of Trebes. “I know Arnaud: loyal, altruistic, and since he was small, working for other people, committed to the country,” she said, adding the practising Catholic would have wanted his act to make people “a bit more tolerant”. Lakdim, a 25-year-old Moroccan-born French national who was on a watchlist of suspected extremists, also killed a butcher and an elderly shopper when he stormed the Super U supermarket after firing at police and shooting dead a man when hijacking a car in Carcassonne. During the siege he said he was acting on behalf of the Islamic State group and demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam, the prime suspect in the November 2015 Paris terror attacks. Yesterday, police continued to question his 18-year-old girlfriend, who converted to Islam at 16 and had also been on the watchlist of potential radicals. Paris prosecutor Francois Molins told reporters that she shouted Allahu Akbar (God is greatest) while in custody, but denied any prior knowledge of Lakdim’s attack plans. A 17-year-old man described as a friend of Lakdim’s who was under his sway, is also in custody over the attack. He too denies any involvement, Molins said. Under France’s anti-terrorism laws, the two suspects can be held for up to 96 hours without charge. Over 200 officers are probing the latest in a string of jihadist attacks that have claimed the lives of over 240 people around France since January 2015. President Emmanuel Macron will lead a national commemoration to Beltrame at Invalides military museum in Paris on Wednesday, his office said. Pope Francis, in a message to the Catholic Church in Carcassonne, saluted “the generous and heroic gesture of Lieutenant-Colonel Arnaud Beltrame, who gave his life in trying to protect others.” Richard Lizurey, the head of France’s gendarmes police service, said Beltrame took the initiative to swap places with a woman being used by Lakdim as a human shield at the Super U supermarket in Trebes. Beltrame’s widow Marielle told the Christian weekly La Vie that his actions were “the act of a gendarme and of a Christian.” Lakdim came to France with his family in 1992 as an infant and gained citizenship 12 years later. He dabbled in drugs and petty crime and in 2016 spent a month in prison but prison authorities “detected no visible sign of radicalisation”, Molins said. But investigators have found notes at his home in Carcassonne referring to the Islamic State group, a legal source said, including a handwritten letter in which he claimed allegiance to the jihadists. Armed with a gun, knife and homemade explosive devices, he remained holed up for over two hours at the Super U supermarket with Beltrame, who took the place of a female hostage. Beltrame was fatally stabbed in the throat by Lakdim shortly before police stormed the store, ending the siege. Hundreds of mourners packed a church service Sunday for the victims of France’s latest Islamist attack. Asked if she felt hatred towards Lakdim, Beltrame’s mother replied: “Not at all. I feel indifference and the greatest sense of contempt.” She also suggested not even talking about him, “not showing his photo. We should show the photos of heroes, not killers and monsters.” "	Terrorism	Terrorism
Proud mother of slain French police hero calls for tolerance	"PARIS (AFP) - The mother of a French policeman killed in an attack last week after he swapped himself for a hostage said Monday (March 26) she was proud of his actions, and did not feel hate towards his killer. Speaking to RTL radio on Monday, Nicolle Beltrame said she was not surprised by her 44-year-old son Arnaud's selfless act at a supermarket in south-west France on Friday, saying he was a fierce patriot and proud serviceman. ""Arnaud would not have wanted us to give up,"" she said. ""I'm here to honour him and I'm speaking to honour him, so that his act has some purpose, that we're a bit more human, a bit more tolerant."" She added: ""We need to realise that we can't accept everything either."" Arnaud was killed on Friday during a shooting spree and hostage-taking around the towns of Carcassonne and Trebes by Radouane Lakdim, a Moroccan-born French national, that left four people dead and three injured. Beltrame said when she heard that a policeman had been killed on Friday, she knew it was her son. ""I know Arnaud: loyal, altruistic, and since he was small working for other people, committed to the country,"" she explained. It also emerged Monday that Lakdim's girlfriend, like the gunman himself, had been on a watchlist of suspected extremists, sources close to the inquiry told AFP. The 18-year-old woman, who has been in police custody since Friday evening, was under surveillance by intelligence services, one source told AFP. A legal source had told AFP on Sunday that the woman was answering questions during her detention, and had ""shown signs of radicalisation"". A 17-year-old man has also been detained for questioning. Lakdim, 25, a drug dealer with a criminal record, was on France's extremist watchlist but authorities had concluded that he did not pose a threat. Asked if she felt hatred towards Lakdim, Nicolle Beltrame replied: ""Not at all. I feel indifference and the greatest sense of contempt."" She suggested not even talking about him, ""not showing his photo. We should show the photos of heroes, not killers and monsters."" Richard Lizurey, the head of France’s gendarmes police service, said Beltrame had taken the initiative to swap places with a woman being used by Lakdim as a human shield at the Super U supermarket in Trebes. “It was the first time in the history of the service this kind of act was done,” Lizurey told France Inter radio. “The decision made by Arnaud Beltrame was his own decision, which he determined he had to do because he wanted to save a hostage’s life, which is what he did."" President Emmanuel Macron’s office has said a national tribute will be organised in the coming days, expected for Wednesday or Thursday. “He has not spoken to me directly but I’m aware there will indeed be a national commemoration at the Invalides,” the officer’s mother said, referring to the military museum and hospital in Paris. Investigators have found notes at Lakdim's home in Carcassonne referring to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria group, a legal source said, including a handwritten letter in which he claimed allegiance to the extremists. On Friday, Lakdim, armed with a gun, knife and homemade explosive devices, hijacked a car in Carcassonne and shot the two people inside, killing the passenger and leaving the Portuguese driver in a critical condition. He also shot and wounded a police officer out jogging before heading to Trebes, where he killed the butcher and a customer at the Super U supermarket before taking hostages. Beltrame was shot and stabbed in the throat by Lakdim shortly before police stormed the store and ended the siege. He died of his wounds early Saturday, prompting an outpouring of emotion across the country."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Police monitoring thousands of IS-linked social media accounts	" KUALA LUMPUR, March 13 ? Thousands of social media accounts suspected of links to the Islamic State (IS) terrorist group are being monitored by local law enforcers, said the Home Ministry. Deputy Home Minister Datuk Masir Kujat told Parliament that to date 3,871 Facebook accounts are being monitored while 800 more were blocked and 240 users arrested. On Twitter, the police are monitoring 76 accounts, have blocked nine and arrested eight people. On Instagram, the police are monitoring 72 accounts and have made one arrest. “We find that they use social media to recruit new members and to look for funds from sympathisers. We have arrested those who use social media as (IS) recruiting grounds,” he said when answering an additional question by Tasek Gelugor (BN) MP Datuk Shabudin Yahaya. He attributed the police’s success to its counter messaging centre (CMC), which has been tasked to curb IS influence and propaganda on social media. Earlier, Masir also told Dewan Rakyat that the Home Ministry is deradicalising 19 people consisting of 18 locals and one foreigner. Another nine individuals have also reached the last phase, which is phase four of the deradicalisation programme. “The deradicalisation programmes uses a systematic and holistic deradicalisation procedures on terrorist consisting of religious, nationalistic, psychological, familial and core values. “The programme is considered successful when the detainees can be released and are no longer involved in terror activities. The modules are consistently reviewed and updated from time to time,” said Masir."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Calls for knife attacks preceded Sunday's sword rampage in Yogyakarta church: Counter-terror official	"KUALA LUMPUR: Radical groups were calling for knife attacks in Indonesia just a week before a sword-wielding man stabbed a Catholic priest and three others during mass in a church in Yogyakarta on Sunday (Feb 12), a counter-terrorism source told Channel NewsAsia. The attacker also slashed the statues of Jesus and the Virgin Mary during the violence at the Santa Lidwina church in Yogyakarta, Central Java. Counter-terrorism officials and the police are now investigating whether the attacker, Suliyono, 23, was inspired by radicals to carry out the attacks as a lonewolf or whether he is part of a terror group. “From several radical groups we were monitoring, it was found that they (radicals) were broadcasting calls to mujahidins to use knives to carry out attacks just a week ago,” a counter-terrorism official told Channel NewsAsia. The official did not give details on what platforms the broadcasts were delivered. Police are also investigating whether the suspect is linked to terror groups from Solo, Central Java, which had earlier planned to carry out attacks during Christmas and New Year’s Day but later postponed them. Counter-terrorism sources are now predicting an increase in acts of terror in Yogyakarta as there have been a rising number of activities by radical groups in the province. “In the past few months, there has been several incidents of persecution and rejection of church activities by the Islamic Jihad Front (FJI), among others, in Bantul and Mount Kidul,” the official told Channel NewsAsia. Bantul and Mount Kidul are regencies in Yogyakarta province. FJI is a hardline group that was launched in 2011 and headquartered in Bantul. The group is implicated in acts of violence against minorities, including Christians and Shias. On Jan 28, FJI disrupted and shut down a charity event organised by the St Paulus Pringgolayan Catholic church in Bantul. “Acts of persecution, attacks and terror in the special province of Yogyakarta will increase in line with the rise of activities by radical mass organisations, and also because of the policy of the provincial government, which has not taken firm actions in dealing with these acts of violence and intolerance in the city,” the official said. On Monday (Feb 12), Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo told reporters that there is no place for intolerance in Indonesia. “There is no place for those who are intolerant in our country, Indonesia,” President Widodo was quoted as saying by the Kompas daily, adding that the country’s constitution guarantees religious freedom to every citizen."

Gunman with IS links kills 3 in Belgian city	"A gunman on a police watchlist for contacts with Islamist extremists launched a brazen suspected terror attack in Belgium on Tuesday, shooting dead two female police officers with their own weapons before killing a bystander. The bloodshed in the gritty eastern industrial city of Liege began around 10:30 a.m. (0830 GMT) when the attacker armed with a knife repeatedly stabbed the two officers before using their own firearms to kill them, prosecutors said. Federal prosecutors said they had launched a terror investigation into the incident. Amateur video obtained by AFP appears to show the gunman shouting “Allahu Akbar” (“God is greatest”) as he attacked the police, although officials did not confirm it. Belgium remains on high alert after a string of attacks, including twin suicide bombings in Brussels in 2016 claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group. “Armed with a knife, the suspect followed and attacked two police officers, and used their own firearms to kill them,” prosecutor Philippe Dulieu told a news conference. “He continued on foot, attacking a parked vehicle where he opened fire on a 22-year-old man in the passenger seat. The young man died.” “He then continued and entered the Leonie de Waha school. He took a woman working there as hostage. Police intervened, he came out firing on the police officers, wounding several before he was killed,” he added. A source close to the investigation told AFP that the gunman was on a special police watchlist because of his contacts with radical Islamists. The source named the attacker as Benjamin Herman, born in 1982, saying he had past convictions for robbery, violence, and drug dealing. Herman was “already on the run” after committing another murder on Monday night in the town of On, in southern Belgium, the source said, though local prosecutors said they have not yet established a link with the Liege incident. He was reported by Belgian broadcaster RTBF to have been released from prison on Monday. “He is suspected of having been radicalized (in prison)… He has been reported or presumed to be belonging to the entourage of an Islamist recruiter,” the source said on condition of anonymity. A Twitter user posted dramatic footage of the violent climax to the incident. As a group of armed officers approach the entrance to the school, the black-clad gunman bursts out with a gun in each hand, before collapsing under a deafening hail of police bullets. Liege police chief Christian Beaupere said it was “clear that the assassin’s objective was to attack the police.” He added that one of the four officers wounded in the attack had suffered a serious leg injury. Liege, a major city in Western Europe’s former industrial heartland, was the scene of another bloody shootout in 2011. In that attack a former convict armed with grenades and an automatic rifle killed six people and wounded more than 120. Prime Minister Charles Michel denounced what he called the “cowardly and blind violence” of Tuesday’s attack. “All our support for the victims and their loved ones. We are following the situation with the security services and the crisis center,” Michel tweeted. There was support from other European countries, with French President Emmanuel Macron condemning the incident as a “terrible attack” and expressing the “solidarity of the French people”. British Prime Minister Theresa May said the United Kingdom “stands resolute with our Belgian allies against terror”. A major security cordon was set up around the area, while panicked parents came to collect their children from the school complex. The governor of Liege province said all the children and staff were safe and unhurt. “All the children are fine, those of the primary and kindergarten saw nothing, they were evacuated through the back of the school,” Julie Fernandez, mother of a seven-year-old at the school, told AFP. “They were cared for by staff and psychologists and high school students were cared for in a nearby park,” added Fernandez, who is also an MP. Belgium has been on high alert since authorities in January 2015 smashed a terror cell in the town of Verviers that was planning an attack on police. The cell also had links to Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the mastermind of the November 2015 IS attacks on Paris that killed 130 people. Belgium further raised its terror alert level after the Paris attack and placed the capital Brussels on lockdown for a week. The country was then hit itself by IS suicide attacks on Brussels airport and a metro station, which killed 32 people in March 2016. In August that same year, a machete-wielding man shouting “Allahu Akbar” attacked two policewomen in the industrial town of Charleroi before being shot dead. The country’s law enforcement agencies and intelligence services came under intense scrutiny for apparently missing a series of leads after the Paris attacks that could have led to the Brussels bombers."

"Iran promises ‘crushing’ response if US designates Guards a terrorist group, reports media"	"LONDON, Oct 9 — Iran promised today to give a “crushing” response if the United States designated its elite Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group. The pledge came a week before President Donald Trump announces final decision on how he wants to contain Tehran. He is expected on Oct 15 to will decertify the landmark international deal to curb Iran’s nuclear programme, in a step that potentially could cause the 2015 accord to unravel. Trump is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation, as he rolls out a broader US strategy on Iran. “We are hopeful that the United States does not make this strategic mistake,” foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying by the state news agency IRNA at a news conference. “If they do, Iran’s reaction would be firm, decisive and crushing and the United States should bear all its consequences,” he added. Individuals and entities associated with the IRGC are currently on the US list of foreign terrorist organisations, but the organisation as a whole is not. IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said yesterday “if the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.” Jafari also said that additional sanctions would end the chances for future dialogue with the United States and that the Americans would have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000 km (1,250 mile) range of IRGC’s missiles."

France foiled possible ricin attack	"PARIS • French police have foiled a suspected attack by an Egyptian man, possibly involving the lethal poison ricin, officials and sources close to the inquiry said yesterday. The plot was one of three prevented by domestic intelligence agents since the start of this year, Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said. He said the attack would have been committed ""with explosives or ricin"", which he described as a very ""powerful poison"". The suspect ""had tutorials that showed how to make ricin-based poisons"", Mr Collomb told BFM television. The man, who was born in Egypt in 1988 and living legally in France, was not previously known to security services, he said. The suspect was arrested alongside another Egyptian, initially identified by Mr Collomb as a brother, who has been released after investigators determined he was not involved in the planned attack. Mr Collomb said the plot was thwarted after intelligence agents intercepted messages on the secure social media platform Telegram. ""We're following a number of people on (social media) networks. These two happened to be on Telegram,"" he told BFM TV. The pair were detained on May 11 after a search of an apartment uncovered a bag of gunpowder obtained from fireworks and guides for making explosives and poisons, a source close to the inquiry said. Under questioning, the suspect ""freely admitted looking up jihadist propaganda and claimed that a person, not yet identified, had asked him via Telegram to find fireworks to make a bomb and strike in France"", the source said. Police later found that despite later denials, in subsequent messages the suspect ""had in reality accepted the mission and was ready to die as a martyr by blowing himself up"", the source said. Investigators believe the evidence suggests he was ""very determined"" to strike, the source added. The two Egyptians were arrested just a day before a 29-year-old man was killed and five other people injured in a knife attack by Khamzat Azimov, a 20-year-old man of Chechen origin, in Paris last Saturday night. They lived in the same northern 18th Arrondissement of Paris as Azimov. Parts of the district are packed with low-income high-rises and a mix of French and immigrant communities. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria later claimed responsibility for the knife attack, releasing a video purporting to show Azimov pledging allegiance to the militant group. A friend of Azimov's, named as Abdul Hakim A., was charged with terrorist conspiracy on Thursday and two women have been detained for questioning. A source said one of the women was a radicalised 19-year-old who married Abdul Hakim A. before trying to leave for Syria in January last year. France has been on high alert since the massacre of journalists at the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, the first in a wave of terror strikes on French soil which have left 246 people dead. In late March, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe indicated that a total of 51 attacks had been thwarted by French security services since January 2015."	Terrorism	Terrorism
 10 killed as van plows into Toronto crowd	"TORONTO, Canada — Canadian police sought a motive Tuesday for a van attack on a bustling downtown Toronto street that left at least 10 pedestrians dead. The driver of the van, who was arrested, was to appear in court Tuesday at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT | 10 p.m. PHT), Canadian media said. Police said the incident during the busy lunch hour Monday appeared to be deliberate, but that they had not identified a terror link. It took place in broad daylight around 16 kilometers (10 miles) from a conference center hosting a meeting of G7 ministers, but officials said they had no evidence of a link to the event. Ralph Goodale, the minister of public security, added that “on the basis of all available information at the present time, there would appear to be no national security connection to this particular incident.” “Horrible day in Toronto,” he posted earlier on Twitter. “Senseless violence takes heavy toll.” Police arrested a suspect at the scene, who police identified later as 25-year-old Alek Minassian from a northern Toronto suburb. The suspect and a police officer faced off, their guns drawn. The suspect eventually surrendered his weapon and was taken into custody. Fifteen people remained in hospitals throughout the city, Saunders said, adding that local, provincial and federal investigators were probing the case. Two South Koreans were among the dead, a Seoul foreign ministry official told AFP, with another of its citizens seriously injured. At the scene, at least three bodies could be seen under orange sheets and a long stretch of road was sealed off with police incident tape. Vehicle attacks have been carried out to deadly effect by extremists in a number of capitals and major cities, including London, Paris, New York and Nice. Canada’s Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said the G7 meeting would continue as planned into Tuesday, with officials discussing ways to secure democratic societies from foreign interference. “The work of the ministers obviously goes on. This is a very sad day for the people of Toronto and the people of Canada,” she said. – ’Really fast’ – Officers were called to the scene — on Yonge Street at the corner with Finch Avenue — around 1:30 pm (1730 GMT), police said. A white rental van with a dented front bumper was stopped on the sidewalk of a major intersection, surrounded by police vehicles. “He was going really fast,” witness Alex Shaker told CTV television. “All I could see was just people one by one getting knocked out, knocked out, one by one,” Shaker said. “There are so many people lying down on the streets.” Another witness, Jamie Eopni, told local Toronto television station CP24: “It was crashing into everything. It destroyed a bench. If anybody was on that street, they would have been hit on the sidewalk.” Though the act seemed “deliberate,” officials did not identify a terror link. Canada has only rarely been the scene of terror attacks. In October, a man stabbed a police officer in the western city of Edmonton before slamming his van into a group of pedestrians, hurting four people. And in Quebec in October 2014, a Canadian man ran over two soldiers in a parking lot with his car, killing one of them. The driver was shot dead by police when he attacked them with a knife. In March 2016, a Canadian who claimed to have radical Islamist sympathies attacked two soldiers at a military recruitment center in Toronto."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Van plows into Toronto crowd, killing nine"	"The incident took place in broad daylight around 10 miles (16 kilometers) from a conference center hosting a meeting of G7 ministers, but officials said they had no evidence of a link to the event. Police arrested a suspect at the scene, but said it was too soon to say whether the attack in Toronto -- which has a population of about 2.8 million people -- had been deliberate, and if so, what the driver's motivation might have been. ""This is going to be a complex investigation,"" deputy police chief Peter Yuen told reporters. ""We have one person in custody and the investigation is ongoing."" ""We can confirm for you tonight right now we have nine people that are dead, 16 injured."" At the scene, an AFP reporter saw at least three bodies under orange sheets and a long stretch of road sealed off with police incident tape.

Television images showed the man and a police officer facing off, their guns drawn. The suspect eventually surrendered his weapon and was taken into custody.

"Two caught for plotting IS attacks, al Maunah-style raid on Bukit Aman"	" PETALING JAYA, Jan 22 — Police arrested two people on suspicion of planning terrorist attacks against non-Muslims and an audacious raid on the federal police’s armoury here as part of the Islamic State (IS)’s activities. According to Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi Harun, the first suspect was a 23-year-old Indonesian labourer who allegedly planned a daring raid on the Bukit Aman federal police headquarters to seize the police’s weaponry and on the Travers police station in Brickfields. In shades of the al Maunah incident of 2000, Mohamad Fuzi said the suspect had also attempted to infiltrate army camps and other police stations to acquire guns and ammunition for militant groups in the region to launch attacks. He said the suspect was arrested on Thursday after police discovered he was conducting reconnaissance activities around Jalan Pudu, Kuala Lumpur, while armed with a knife. “The suspect was targeting Buddhist monks and planned to kill them as an act of revenge against Muslim Rohingya persecuted in Myanmar by the government,” he said. The suspect was also found to have been in contact with a senior leader of the IS through WhatsApp and tried to recruit Indonesians to their cause. “To prove that Daesh was still active in Malaysia, he also raised the group’s flag at his construction site workplace,” he said, using the alternate name for the terrorist group. Police arresting a religious teacher suspected of involvement with IS, in Petaling Jaya. — Picture courtesy of Royal Malaysian Police The second suspect is a 25-year-old teacher at a private religious school in Subang Jaya who was arrested in Petaling Jaya on Dec 23. “He was previously detained under the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 in November 2015, but was subsequently released after serving his 18 months sentence in 2016,” he said in a statement. Mohamad Fuzi said the suspect resumed involvement with the IS after he was freed, and allegedly planned several attacks against entertainment outlets throughout Klang Valley. The man allegedly planned to rob, kidnap and murder non-Muslims based on his belief that they were infidels. Investigations found that the suspect actively used his personal Facebook account to recruit new members and was linked to several IS terror cells that were previously neutralised using the Internal Security Act before it was abolished."

Malaysia pulling out all the stops in war on terrorism	"PUTRAJAYA: Malaysian authorities have thwarted 19 terror plots and apprehended 369 suspect Islamic State (IS) militants the last four years. Deputy Home Minister Datuk Nur Jazlan Mohamed said 87 foreigners were among the terrorists detected between 2013 and 2017. ""The grenade attack at the Movida bar in Puchong in June 2016 was considered as the first IS-linked attack in Malaysia,” he said of the attack which injured eight people then. ""Thankfully, it did not result in any deaths, and the perpetrators were arrested and sentenced to jail,” Nur Jazlan added. Two people admitted to the crime and were each jailed 25 years. ""That incident was an apt reminder to us on the reality of modern terrorism, where conflicts that is happening thousands of miles away can have a very real repercussions on our security back home,"" he said when delivering the national statement during the Putrajaya International Security Dialogue at Marriot Hotel here. Nur Jazlan said it was time to review the current approach in addressing terrorism as IS recruits new members through social media. ""Through social media, IS continues to recruit members across the globe, mostly targeting disfranchised young men and women who seeks affirmation in their lives. ""They offer a form of escapism by tainting these young minds with their twisted world view and perverse ideology coupled the promise of a higher purpose in life. ""Therefore, the time has come for us to review our current approach in the war on terror. The heavy handed approach which may seem effective in the short term, does not address the core issues of terrorism, which is just as much as this is a war against criminals and terrorists, it is also a war for the hearts and minds, a battle of competing ideologies,"" he said. Nur Jazlan said Malaysia has mooted on the idea of offering a moderate religious interpretation as a proactive measure to stamp out extremism. ""Through counselling, re-education and by involving religious leaders and experts in correcting and countering the perverted views of Islam to terror convicts, we found that not only is it an effective tool in de-racialising them, it would also turn former convicts into key propagator in countering IS propaganda and ideology,"" said Nur Jazlan. Sudanese Interior Minister Major General (Police) Dr Hamid Mohamed, in his national statement, said Sudan also used the same approach as Malaysia to rehabilitate those involved in terrorism cells, which is through deradicalisation programmes. ""The young ones are the easy target for the extremists to recruit them as new members. ""We have deradicalisation programmes as counterterrorism measures. This is to rehabilitate those with extreme and violent religious or political ideologies to adopt more moderate views,"" he said. Representative of the Turkish president Mehmet Mehdi Eker said Turkey actively participates in the Anti-IS coalition such as Foreign Terrorist Fighters and Counter-Finance Working Groups. He also praised Malaysia as a good example for a multiracial, multi-cultural and multi-religious country with people living together in peace and harmony."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Man drives into crowd in Germany, at least 2 dead"	"MÜNSTER, Germany — A man smashed a van into a packed restaurant terrace in Germany Saturday killing at least two people before shooting himself dead, with authorities ruling out an “Islamist” motive. Images of the scene showed broken and upturned tables and chairs strewn across the pavement in the center of the picturesque medieval city of Muenster. While stressing that the investigation was still ongoing, state interior minister Herbert Reul said the perpetrator was believed to be a German citizen “and not, as has been claimed everywhere, a refugee or something like that”. “There is no indication at the moment that there is any Islamist connection,” said Reul, who is from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats. At least 20 people were injured, six of them seriously, police said. The assailant was found shot dead behind the wheel of his van. The police said that “a potentially suspicious object” had been found in the vehicle that might possibly be an explosive, and experts had been called in to deactivate it. Media reports said the driver, identified only as Jens R., had a history of mental health problems. Public broadcaster ZDF said the man had recently attempted suicide while rolling news channel NTV said he had spoken of a desire to bring as much attention as possible to his death. ZDF also reported that he had possible links with far-right movements. The magazine, Der Spiegel, reported that Jens R. lived in Muenster and police had found an assault weapon at his flat. Police in the university city of 300,000 did not immediately confirm the reports. “There was a bang and then screaming. The police arrived and got everyone out of here,” an employee of the restaurant hit by the terrace told NTV. “There were a lot of people screaming. I’m angry — it’s cowardly to do something like this.” Germany has long braced for more violence after several attacks claimed by the Islamic State jihadist group, the bloodiest of which was a truck rampage through a Berlin Christmas market in December 2016 that left 12 people dead. Armed police were deployed in Muenster after Saturday’s incident with officers urging residents to avoid the city center to allow investigators to get to work amid initial fears the country had suffered another extremist assault. Merkel said she was “deeply shaken” by the incident “everything possible will be done to determine what was behind this act and to help the victims”. The presidents of Russia and France, Vladimir Putin and Emmanuel Macron, each sent their condolences. The attack is the latest in a string across Europe in which vehicles have been used to attack crowds of people in public places. In the Berlin Christmas market attack, Tunisian asylum-seeker Anis Amri hijacked a truck and murdered its Polish driver before killing another 11 people and wounding dozens more by ploughing the heavy vehicle through the festive market in central Berlin. He was shot dead by Italian police in Milan four days later while on the run. Germany has since been targeted again in attacks with radical Islamist motives. In July 2017, a 26-year-old Palestinian asylum seeker wielding a knife stormed into a supermarket in the northern port city of Hamburg, killing one person and wounding six others before being detained by passers-by. A court last month sentenced him to life in prison, finding he had had a “jihadist” motive. ISIS also claimed responsibility for a number of attacks in 2016, including the murder of a teenager in Hamburg, a suicide bombing in the southern city of Ansbach that wounded 15, and an axe attack on a train in Bavaria that left five injured. Germany remains a target for jihadist groups, in particular because of its involvement in the coalition fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and its deployment in Afghanistan since 2001. German troops in the anti-ISIS coalition do not participate in combat operations but support it through reconnaissance, refueling and training. Germany’s security services estimate there are around 10,000 Islamic radicals in Germany, some 1,600 of whom are suspected of being capable of using violence. Merkel has allowed in more than one million asylum seekers in the past two years — a decision that has driven the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which charges that the influx spells a heightened security risk. ISIS also claimed several similar attacks in Europe, including a rampage along Barcelona’s Las Ramblas boulevard in August 2017 that killed 14 and left more than 100 injured.

Malaysia arrests two men linked to Islamic State	"KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia has arrested two men believed to have links with militant group Islamic State, including one who allegedly walked around its capital armed with a knife aiming to kill Buddhist monks, police said on Monday. The Muslim-majority Southeast Asian nation has been on high alert since gunmen linked to Islamic State (IS) launched several attacks in Jakarta, the capital of neighbouring Indonesia, in January 2016. The two suspects were arrested in two separate raids in December and January, on suspicion of planning to carry out acts of violence and promoting IS ideology. One of them, an Indonesian who was arrested last week, had allegedly scoured a busy district of the capital, Kuala Lumpur, in November, seeking Buddhist monks to kill, in retaliation for violence suffered by Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. ""The attempt failed, and police managed to confiscate a knife during the raid,"" Mohamad Fuzi Harun, the inspector-general of police, said in a statement. He added that the suspect had also allegedly communicated with a senior IS leader over WhatsApp, had sought to recruit several other Indonesians and put up an IS flag at the building site where he worked. The other suspect, a Malaysian teacher at a private religious school, was detained in December on suspicion of planning an attack on entertainment outlets and to rob, kidnap or kill non-Muslims. The suspect, who had been previously jailed under Malaysia's anti-terror law, had also maintained contact with former members of known terror groups and promoted IS ideology on his Facebook account to recruit new members, police said. Malaysia has arrested hundreds of people over the past few years for suspected links to militant groups. A grenade attack on a bar on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur in June 2016 wounded eight people. Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, the first such incident on Malaysian soil."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Islamic State suspect wanted by Malaysia released after questioning: Thai defence ministry	"KUALA LUMPUR: A Thai national wanted by Malaysian police for suspected links to Islamic State (IS) has been released after authorities found no affiliation to the terror group, an official from the Thai defence ministry told Channel NewsAsia on Thursday (Apr 19). It was reported earlier on Thursday that Awae Wae-Eya, 37, had been arrested. “This individual Awae was arrested by authorities. They have questioned him. He is not Islamic State. He has been released,” said Panitan Wattanayagorn, principal security advisor to Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister Prawit Wongsuwan. “He (Awae) has no record of participating in any IS activities. He is just active online, making comments on IS-linked websites,” Panitan told Channel NewsAsia. He did not elaborate on when Awae was arrested and released. According to Malaysian news agency Bernama, he was arrested in Cho Airong district in southern Thailand. Awae hails from Narathiwat province, and is believed to be a former member of southern Thailand’s separatist movement. Malaysian police announced on Monday that they were trying to track him down, along with three other IS-linked suspects over their alleged involvement in a plot to kidnap and kill police officers, as well as attack churches and temples in Johor. A Malaysian security source earlier told Channel NewsAsia that Awae had pledged allegiance to IS leader Abu Bakar al-Baghdadi, and was planning to establish an IS presence in southern Thailand to fund his “jihad.” It marked the first known case of a Thai Malay pledging allegiance to IS. Southern Thailand insurgents have long eschewed IS and other radical groups as their fight is for greater autonomy, not global jihad. Panitan said Thai authorities have also detected several individuals in southern Thailand who have been communicating with people in the Middle East via extremist websites. “But they have not taken part in any real action on the ground (with terrorists). Some of them have been using IS’ name to raise money for themselves,” said Panitan. “Authorities have since shut down several websites,” he added, without elaborating. When contacted, Malaysian police declined to comment on the release of Awae."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Terror suspect planning Islamic State presence in southern Thailand: Malaysian security source	"KUALA LUMPUR: A former member of southern Thailand’s separatist movement, Awae Wae-Eya, 37, is planning to establish an Islamic State (IS) presence in his country with the hope of securing funds from the global terror group to fund his “jihad"", a senior Malaysian security source has told Channel NewsAsia. Southern Thailand’s insurgents have so far eschewed transnational extremist groups, including IS, and its radical teachings as their struggle is for greater autonomy, not global jihad. “Awae pledged allegiance to Abu Bakar al-Baghdadi (leader of IS) and he has contacts in Syria,” the security source told Channel NewsAsia. Awae hails from Thailand's Narathiwat province in the south. He is currently wanted by Malaysian police for planning terror plots in Johor state. The police said on Monday (Apr 16) that they were hunting Awae and three other IS-linked suspects involved in a plot to kidnap and murder police officers, as well as attack non-Muslim places of worship. Awae's ambitions came to light during the Malaysian intelligence gathering operation which led to six other member of an IS cell being arrested by the Johor counter-terrorism unit. However, while Malaysian intelligence suggests Awae has plans to establish an IS presence in southern Thailand, the authorities there played down the current risk. Major-General Sompol Pankul, commander of the Narathiwat Task Force told Channel NewsAsia: ""I don't think Awae is Islamic State."" He did not elaborate.   Isra News Agency of Thailand reported, quoting a security source, that although Awae is not an IS member, he is someone who supports its ideology and way of fighting. However, while there are differing views about Awae, Panitan Wattanayagorn, principal security advisor to Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister General Prawit Wongsuwan, told Channel NewsAsia that local security agencies are attempting to track him down. ""We hope to identify him in the next few days' time, perhaps at the end of the week,"" said Mr Panitan. ""These suspects in the south, including militants, often have dual citizenship and duplicate names, making it difficult to identify them quickly,"" he added. ""To date there are no signs of IS in southern Thailand or of individuals shifting their affiliation from traditional groups to IS."" According to Professor Zachary Abuza of the National War College in Washington DC, if Awae is indeed looking to establish an IS presence in southern Thailand, this would be a significant move. ""The southern Thai groups do not share IS' transnational ideology,"" said Prof Abuza, who has studied the insurgency for years. “There have been signs that this could happen. Thai security forces have found plenty of IS imagery, including flags, videos, and propaganda on insurgent suspects. But that's all it has been, just IS imagery and propaganda,” said Prof Abuza, who specialises in insurgencies and terrorism in Southeast Asia. The Muslim-majority region in the south of Thailand, covering the provinces of Yala, Narathiwat, Pattani and parts of Songkhla, has been a violence-wracked zone for over a decade as ethnic Malay insurgents battle the Buddhist-majority state for greater autonomy.   Don Pathan, an independent security analyst based in Yala, however, says he has not detected any shift to IS from the insurgents there. ""I would say there is lots of curiosity, not sympathy, thus explaining the high number of clicks on websites on IS activities by the Malays in Patani (Thailand’s southernmost provinces),"" said Pathan.  ""Keep in mind that ... groups like Jemaah Islamimah have tried to penetrate the conflict ... but they failed to convince the Patani Malay movements to take up their radical ideology and extremist approach. ""The Patani Malay struggle is etho-nationalist by nature and there is no indication that the political context is changing or has changed,"" Pathan added. Malaysian police said that Awae was plotting to launch terror attacks against churches, temples and a Freemason building in Johor state. The Thai Malay led an IS cell in Johor where he recruited a total of nine Malaysian men, via Facebook and Telegram, to carry out the terror attacks, according to the security source. ""After recruiting the men, Awae came to Malaysia to meet with the men to discuss the (terror) plot, technical matters and weapons,"" he said. “He (Awae) also wanted to kidnap a police officer and take him back to southern Thailand to be killed,” the source added. The attacks and kidnapping were foiled when Malaysian police arrested six members of Awae's cell in a sting operation in Johor. The terror plot was at its final stage, said the source, with the militants waiting for weapons and explosives from southern Thailand to be brought into Johor Bahru. “We now believe Awae is back in southern Thailand,” he said. ISLAMIC STATE WILL HELP FUND THAI SEPARATIST CAUSE? Since 2004, the dispute in southern Thailand has claimed almost 7,000 lives. The slow progress of the 3-year-old peace talks and a sense that the government in Bangkok lacks a sense of urgency have added to restlesness among separatists and a sense of disillusionment, according to Prof Greg Barton of Deakin University. He highlighted how they seek greater autonomy and greater freedom to express their Malay identity. ""The government would like to bring an end to the troubles, and some are beginning to recognize that the longer the issues remain unresolved the greater the risk of some younger activists being drawn towards ISIS-style global jihadi extremism,"" said Prof Barton. Against that backdrop, and based on Malaysia's intelligence gathering, Awae believes IS will advance the insurgents’ cause in southern Thailand, according to the security source. Awae needs large sums of money for his jihadi activities and he believes that he could get financial support from IS, the source said. “Awae believes that he could get funding from Islamic State once he successfully establishes (a branch) of Islamic State in southern Thailand,” he said. Prof Abuza warned of the dangers of IS establishing a foothold in southern Thailand. For Malaysia, it could mean that many IS militants or supporters would have a network in southern Thailand to utilize when they need to lie low, or more importantly, procure weapons, said Prof Abuza. “This has always been the top concern of Malaysian security officials. But Malaysian security officials have always been concerned that actions taken against southern Thai militants - such as arresting leaders or knocking over bomb factories or safe houses - make Malaysia a target in its own right,” Prof Abuza added. On the part of Thailand, its officials have been obsessed by the possibility of the insurgency morphing into an IS threat, said Prof Abuza. “This (morphing) is made easier by their (Thai officials) very poor understanding of the different Islamist strains. But they would only have themselves to blame ... They have proven completely unwilling to address the core political grievances of MARA Patani, the umbrella grouping for the insurgent groups,” he added. Prof Abuza warned of growing radicalism in southern Thailand as a younger generation of militants rise through the ranks. “Most of the insurgents eschew the transnational ideology and the radicalism of IS,” said Prof Abuza. “But do not underestimate the potential for growing radicalism as a younger generation of militants steps into leadership positions.”"	Terrorism	Terrorism
6 Islamic State suspects arrested in Johor for planning attacks on places of worship	" KUALA LUMPUR: Seven suspected terrorists have been arrested in Johor and Sabah, said Malaysian police on Saturday (Mar 24).  Six of them, Malaysians from an Islamic State cell, were arrested in Johor for allegedly planning attacks on non-Muslim places of worship and plotting to kill police personnel, while an Abu Sayyaf member was detained in Sabah, said the police in a statement. The men were arrested in multiple operations between Feb 27 and Mar 15. In the first operation, police arrested a 37-year-old man believed to be the mastermind of the planned attacks on places of worship in Johor Bahru. He also actively recruited new militants, said Inspector-General of Police Mohamad Fuzi Harun. ""The second suspect is a 49-year-old security guard and adviser to the terror cell,"" he said, adding that the suspect was in charge of ensuring cell members kept their activities secret. He also gave orders to kill any member who leaked secrets. The third suspect was a 30-year-old security guard who was tasked with acquiring firearms from another country. He also scouted several places of worship across Johor Bahru.  The suspects planned to escape to a neighbouring country to seek refuge with another terror group after carrying out their attacks, said the police chief, without naming the country. Three other members of the same cell were arrested in follow-up operations. One of them was a 25-year-old waiter who had been ordered to kidnap and kill police personnel.  Two other suspects, aged 23 and 22, were arrested on Mar 1 and were working as janitors in Singapore. One of them acted as the intermediary in the purchase of firearms for the cell.  As for the Abu Sayyaf member who was arrested on Mar 15, he is said to be a trusted lieutenant to group leader Furuji Indama and has links to Malaysian militant Mahmud Ahmad. The Filipino man, who is wanted by the Philippines for his involvement in a a kidnap-for-ransom syndicate, is also an expert in making improvised explosive devices. The police chief added that the suspect had planned to carry out several attacks in Sabah and was responsible for making the state a safe haven for terror groups from the Philippines."

 SDF to study any request to hand over British Islamic State militants captured in Syria	" AMUDA, Syria/WASHINGTON: The U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) has not received a request from any foreign government to hand over two British Islamic State militants in its custody but will study any such request if made, a senior SDF official told Reuters on Friday. ""We have not received any official request from any international party to hand over the two prisoners,"" Redur Xelil, the SDF official, said. Any such request would be studied, he added. U.S. officials said on Thursday that the SDF, a militia force, had last month captured Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee ElSheikh, two of four militants known as the ""Beatles"" for their English accents. They were notorious for their role in the kidnap, torture and killing of Western hostages in Syria. Earlier U.S. and European officials said on Friday that Britain, the United States and officials in the region are discussing what should happen with the two militants. ""Together with our coalition partners, we are still considering options regarding ElSheikh and Kotey, but rest assured there is a common intention to hold anyone accountable who commits acts like those they are alleged to have committed,"" said a spokesman for the U.S. National Security Council. Xelil also confirmed that officials from the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State had taken part in the questioning of the two Britons. Earlier Xelil told Reuters Kotey was captured in a rural area of Raqqa province on Jan. 24 and was aiming to reach Turkey when he was captured by the Kurdish-led forces. ""He was intending to escape towards Turkey with cooperation and coordination with friends of his on the Turkish side,"" Xelil said. ""He is now under investigation with us,"" he said. Xelil gave no information about the second militant, ElSheikh. A senior security official in Turkey, however, accused the SDF of anti-Turkish propaganda, saying it was ""nonsense"" that an Islamic State militant would say they were going to Turkey, and that Ankara was taking every step to eliminate IS militants in Turkey. ""It is not that easy to cross the border without permission. There is a wall as well,"" said the official. The SDF, which is spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, has consistently accused Turkey of supporting Islamic State militants in northern Syria, where the U.S.-led coalition has helped the SDF to drive the jihadists from swathes of territory. In 2016 Turkey launched a military incursion into northern Syria to drive back IS fighters from the border, and it has built a wall along its 911-km (566-mile) frontier to try to halt infiltration. Turkish authorities have also detained hundreds of people across Turkey suspected of being Islamic State members since IS fighters were defeated in the Syrian city of Raqqa in October by the SDF. Turkey views the YPG as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought a three-decade insurgency in Turkey and is listed as a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union. It launched an offensive into the Kurdish Afrin region of northwestern Syria on Jan. 20, aiming to crush the YPG. The senior Turkish security official said: ""Turkey is open to joint cooperation, including intelligence, with all its international partners. Turkey has been fighting with IS in every way both inside the country and abroad."" The New York Times reported on Thursday that the British government had revoked the British citizenship of both Kotey and ElSheikh. Britain has taken similar action in the past against dual nationals who left Britain to join militant groups abroad. In the case of a former London resident who joined the Somali militant group al Shabaab, the militant Mahdi Hashi was sent for a federal court trial on terrorism related charges in New York. Hashi pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to provide material support to al Shabaab and was sentenced to nine years in U.S. prison."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Philippine doctor in New York plot charged in kidnap-murder case	"MANILA, Jan 30 — A Philippine doctor accused of wiring money for a foiled New York jihadist plot has been charged in a separate Islamic State-inspired kidnapping and murder case at home, documents released today said. Russel Salic, an orthopaedic surgeon, has been held in custody in the Philippines after US prosecutors charged him over a failed plot to attack New York’s subway, Times Square and concert venues in the name of IS during the Ramadan in 2016. US prosecutors are seeking his extradition. Now Salic and 53 other suspected Filipino extremists have been charged with kidnapping six lumber yard workers in the southern island of Mindanao — killing two of them — to demonstrate their loyalty to the IS movement in the Middle East. The hostages said that in 2016, armed men in the southern island of Mindanao, abducted and tortured them, accusing them of being spies for the military, the Justice Department documents said. The hostages were made to wear orange clothes and photographed. They were told that the pictures would be loaded onto the Internet to show the armed band’s loyalty to IS. Two of the hostages were later beheaded but the rest were freed after their employer negotiated with the kidnappers. The workers said that among their captors was a man who they were told was a doctor but who was only seen guarding and cleaning guns. This man was later identified as Salic, the department said. Salic has insisted he was innocent and said he could prove he was attending a medical convention elsewhere during the incident, the department records showed. However he was still included in the list of 54 accused in the kidnapping and murder case which has been blamed on the Maute group, a local extremist band that has previously pledged allegiance to the IS movement. Only Salic and three other individuals named in the charge sheet are in custody. The Maute group spearheaded the bloody siege of the southern city of Marawi last year that lasted five months and left over a thousand dead, including many of the groups fighters. The Justice Department could not immediately say whether the new charges would affect efforts to extradite Salic to the United States."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Armed men kidnap 15 girls in southeastern Niger	"NIAMEY: Armed men kidnapped 15 girls overnight in southeastern Niger, the local mayor said on Saturday. Boukar Mani Orthe, the mayor of Toumour in Niger's Diffa region near the border with Nigeria, said about 50 unidentified armed men seized the girls in a village about 9 km (6 miles) from the town centre. On Thursday suspected Boko Haram fighters killed eight people working at French drilling company Foraco's water well site in Toumour. Boko Haram has been waging an insurrection since 2009 aimed at establishing an Islamic state in northeast Nigeria. It has launched repeated attacks into neighbouring Niger, Chad and Cameroon. The violence has killed thousands of civilians and forced millions to flee their homes in the large Lake Chad basin region."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Freed Japanese journalist says Syria kidnap ordeal was 'hell'	"A Japanese journalist who was held in Syria for more than three years before being freed this week has described his lengthy captivity as ""hell."" Jumpei Yasuda was freed earlier this week and taken to Turkey, where Japanese government officials confirmed his identity before announcing Wednesday that he was free. He boarded a plane bound for Tokyo on Thursday, speaking briefly to journalists in an interview broadcast by Japanese media. ""It was hell,"" he said, sporting a long beard peppered with grey hair. ""Not only physically, but mentally as well. The thought each day that 'I'm not being released today either' left me losing control over myself bit by bit."" Yasuda, who is expected to arrive in Tokyo on Thursday evening, spoke calmly, but appeared slightly overwhelmed and tired, if otherwise healthy. ""For about 40 months, I have not spoken a word of Japanese. Words don't come to my mind easily,"" he said. ""I am happy that I am returning to Japan. At the same time, I have no idea what will happen now and how I should conduct myself. I am at loss and don't know what to think."" Yasuda was kidnapped in Syria in June 2015, and was reportedly initially a hostage of the group previously known as the Al-Nusra Front, a former Al-Qaeda affiliate. But the group's current iteration, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, denied any involvement in his kidnapping in a statement earlier this week. There was only sporadic news of Yasuda throughout his captivity, including a bizarre video that emerged in August showing him and a man identified as an Italian called Alessandro Sandrini. Both men appealed for their release, dressed in orange jumpsuits, as masked, armed men stood behind them. Yasuda gave his name as Omar and described himself as South Korean, but his wife Myu confirmed that it was her husband in the video. The video did not identify who was holding the men or what their demands were. There has been no word on the fate of Sandrini since. Yasuda told journalists he believed he was held for all of his captivity in Idlib, a province in northwestern Syria that is one of the last parts of the country still held in part by rebels and jihadists. The details of how Yasuda was freed have remained murky, with the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, saying a ransom was paid. But Japan's government has denied that. In 2015, militants from the Islamic State group beheaded Japanese war correspondent Kenji Goto and his friend Haruna Yukawa in Syria. The Japanese government was criticised for what detractors saw as its flat-footed response to the crisis at the time, including apparently missed opportunities to free both men. But other Japanese hostages who have been freed and made it home safely have also faced heavy public criticism for what some have deemed reckless behaviour."	Terrorism	Terrorism
 Abu sayyaf men linked to basilan kidnap fall	"After 16 years in hiding, two Abu Sayyaf members who kidnapped 20 workers of a banana plantation in Basilan in 2001were  arrested Friday night.Chief Supt. Billy Beltran, regional director of provincial regional office-9 in Zamboanga City, identified the two  ASG members as Emran Sanduyugan Ismael, alias Bantong Basinti and Bryan Ismail Mahommad, alias Pojong. The two ASG  bandits were facing kidnapping and serious illegal detention for their complicity in numerous criminal acts when subdued by police intelligence operatives inside the Mindpro City Mall in Zamboanga City at about 9:15 p.m. Reports said the bandits were arrested on the strength of a warrant of arrest issued by Judge Leo Jay Principe of the Isabela City Regional Trial Court with no bail recommended. The arrest of Sanduyugan and Ismail brought to nearly dozens of ASG members who participated in the attack and kidnapping of at least 30 workers of Golden Harvest Plantation in Lantawan, Basilan in June 2001. In the said attack, nine civilians were beheaded by the ASG at the height of the kidnapping. The attack also resulted in the death of a worker who was shot by the bandits minutes before fleeing the scene to evade arrest from responding army and police personnel. The arrested ASG militants were positively identified by witnesses whom identities the authorities withheld for security reasons. The ASG operatives are now in the custody of the Zambaonga City Police Station-11 pending their turnover to the appropriate court. Among those already arrested in the Golden Harvest attack by the ASG were Abu Usman who was nabbed at the Port Area of Isabela City in Basilan. In July 2014, another ASG member, Ali Salih, also a culprit in the same incident, was arrested by joint police and military teams in Panigayan village in Malamawi Island, Isabela City. At present, the ASG has been held at bay, not figuring in any terrorist acts following their defeat and the death of their supreme leader and ISIS emir in Southeast Asia, Isnilon Hapilon in the Marawi City bloody siege.Meanwhile, the Islamic State-inspired Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters were reported to be running out of funds and have linked with drug syndicates and is forcing civilians to shell out money in the form of “zakat” (religious tax) to fund its armed operations, Gov. Esmael Mangudadatu said. In an interview, Mangudadatu said the collection of “zakat” is supposedly voluntary and no specific amount a Moro may share for the operation of a local Mosque or place of worship. “But the BIFF has been doing it under duress,” he said. “This is happening in remote villages where poor farmers could not refuse forced taxation, otherwise, they will be harassed.”   Mangudadatu earlier told the Provincial Peace and Order Council, which he chairs, that BIFF members also turned to peddling illegal drugs, selling stuff in and out of Maguindanao.  The BIFF turned to illegal drug syndicates for funds while the drug lords ally with the armed group for protection in the wake of the intensified campaign against illegal drugs and drug personalities. “It is a case of one group benefitting from the other in illegal activities,” the governor said. To contain this problem, Mangudadatu urged the local populace not to give in to BIFF-imposed “zakat.” He urged local officials down to the barangays to help military and police authorities contain the BIFF so their villages would improve. “This is for the benefit of people on the ground. The government cannot do it alone. We need the support of grassroots,” he added. During the PPOC meeting, officials from the affected towns of Shariff Aguak, Datu Unsay, Datu Saudi, Datu Hofer and Datu Salibo complained of forced taxation by the BIFF, informing the governor that many who resisted taxation were executed. The military has repeatedly pounded BIFF positions in Maguindanao in the tri-boundaries of Datu Unsay, Datu Saudi, and Datu Hofer where the BIFF had harassed hundreds of families from Teduray communities since Dec. 25. An estimated 800 Teduray families are currently staying in evacuation centers in the province due to the series of BIFF harassments."	Terrorism	Terrorism
" IS repels US-backed forces from east Syria holdout, reports monitor"	"BEIRUT, Oct 28 — The Islamic State group has ousted a US-backed coalition of Kurdish and Arab forces from its holdout in eastern Syria, killing dozens of fighters, a monitoring group said today. A Syrian Democratic Forces commander, asking not to be named, confirmed the SDF retreat from the Hajin pocket near the Iraqi border seven weeks into an offensive. The SDF, who are backed by air strikes of the US-led coalition, launched its campaign to retake the IS holdout on September 10. But they have faced a fierce fightback from the jihadists, including under the cover of sandstorms, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says. “In counterattacks since Friday to Sunday dawn, IS has taken back all positions to which the SDF had advanced inside the Hajin pocket,” the monitoring group’s chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. The Observatory reported 72 SDF fighters killed, as IS took advantage of the storm that hampered coalition air cover and dispatched suicide bombers as part of their fightback. The SDF commander told AFP that his forces had faced a “strong dust storm” and lacked local knowledge of the terrain. Unlike IS, “our forces don’t know the area and can’t move around in conditions of zero visibility,” he said. “Military reinforcements and heavy weapons have been sent to the front and some units will be replaced by more experienced ones,” the commander said. “We will launch a new military campaign as soon as those reinforcements have arrived,” he said. More than 300 SDF fighters and around 500 IS jihadists have been killed in the past seven weeks of fighting, the Observatory says. The coalition estimates that 2,000 IS fighters remain in the Hajin area. IS overran large swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq in 2014, proclaiming a “caliphate” across land it controlled. But the jihadist group has since lost most of that territory to various offensives in both countries. In Syria, its presence has been reduced to parts of the vast Badia desert also in the east and the Hajin pocket. A total of more than 360,000 people have been killed since Syria’s war erupted in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Manhunt for four with IS links, said to be planning attacks on houses of worship and police"	" KUALA LUMPUR, April 16 — Federal police have launched a manhunt for four men, including a Thai national, with suspected links to the Islamic State (IS) militant group, who are said to be planning attacks on non-Muslim houses of worship as well as the police force. Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi Harun in a statement today revealed the identity of the four suspects. “They are considered dangerous as they plan to kidnap and murder police personnel. “We urge the public to immediately alert the police as to their whereabouts as they are capable of launching attacks that threaten national security,” he said. He added that the suspects were part of a 10-man terror cell network whose other members were arrested by the Special Branch Counter-Terrorism Unit in Johor between February 27 and March 1 this year. The first and second suspect, both from Tumpat, Kelantan, have been identified as 29-year-old Muhamad Faizal Muhamad Hanafi and 51-year-old Muhamad Hanafi Yah. The third suspect is Nor Farkhan Mohd Isa, 31, from Skudai, Johor, while the fourth suspect has been named as 37-year-old Awae Wae-Eya from Narathiwat, Thailand. Mohamad Fuzi also warned that anyone with knowledge of the suspects’ whereabouts was punishable by imprisonment of between seven and 30 years. Those with information on the four men are urged to contact the investigating officer, Inspector Mohd Badri Othman of the Special Branch Counter-Terrorism Department, at 017-6727120, Bukit Aman or the nearest police station."

10 sentenced to jail for planned Barcelona attacks	"MADRID, April 10 — Ten members of a jihadist cell linked to the Islamic State group (IS) who planned attacks in Barcelona and to film a decapitation were sentenced to 8-12 years in jail today. The defendants included five Moroccans, four Spaniards and a Brazilian, the National Court, which handles terror cases, said in a ruling. They were “ready to wage an attack against institutions such as the police, banks or Jewish institutions in Spain at any time, or to join the ranks of Daesh,” it added, using the Arabic acronym for IS. The cell was based in Terrassa, not far from Barcelona, the Catalonian capital. Last year, another jihadist group killed 16 people in attacks there and on the nearby popular seaside city of Cambrils. The 10, whose cell was called “Islamic Fraternity, Group for preaching jihad,” were sentenced for “belonging to a terrorist organisation’” the court said. The three leaders of the group were given 12 years in jail while the seven others got eight years. In March 2015, the main leader of the cell, a Spaniard who had converted to Islam, proposed to kidnap and decapitate an “infidel” whom he had already identified, film the killing and then broadcast the video online before fleeing to Syria. He had previously proposed that the group “commit an attack against the Catalan parliament, which no one had objected to,” according to the court ruling. “He also justified decapitations and talked about making handmade bombs to commit attacks.” Police found documents calling for jihad at his home and books on European organisations such as the Basque separatist group ETA or Germany’s far-left Red Army Faction, the ruling said. Members of the cell had also gone on a recce in Barcelona, the Catalonian capital, where they took photos of the train station, a luxury seaside hotel, a shopping mall and a police station. One member went to Syria in April 2014 and died in Fallujah in Iraq the following year. Three others tried to follow in his footsteps at the end of 2014 but were detained at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey. According to the interior ministry, close to a third of all arrests for “jihadist terrorism” in Spain were made in Catalonia last year."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Military validating reports on new ISIS 'emir' from Lanao del Sur	"MANILA - The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) said Tuesday it is still validating reports that a new leader or ""emir"" of the Islamic State in Southeast Asia has emerged from Lanao del Sur. ""The recruitment, reorganizing and regrouping has been going on. It has been going on immediately after, or before the actual Marawi incident happened. So all of these areas, especially the urban areas, places where congestion can happen, we are monitoring it, closely monitoring it through our field units"" Brig. Gen. Bienvenido Datuin, Chief of the AFP Civil Relations Service, told reporters. He was making reference to the five-month siege of Marawi City last year, led by Islamic State-linked terrorists. Maj. Ronald Suscano, spokesperson of the Philippine Army's 1st Infantry Division, was quoted in reports Monday that Abu Dar, a native of Pagayawan town in Lanao del Sur, has succeeded Isnilon Hapilon. Hapilon, said to be the anointed emir of the Islamic State in Southeast Asia, was killed in military offensives in October last year along with terror leader Omar Maute. Both were tagged in the Marawi siege. The reports said Abu Dar was a money courier during the Marawi siege. Suscano described him to be more radical than Hapilon and is known to have connections with foreign terrorists. Datuin said remnants of ISIS-linked terror groups pursued aspirations of their predecessors, which is to establish a caliphate in the Philippines.

"Doctor linked to Maute group charged with kidnapping, murder"	"MANILA - The Department of Justice (DOJ) has indicted a doctor linked to the Maute group and wanted in the United States for allegedly helping finance foiled attacks in New York City for the Islamic State in 2016. Dr. Russel Langi Salic was charged with 4 counts of kidnapping and serious illegal detention and 4 counts of kidnapping and serious illegal detention with murder. Fifty-three others were also indicted before the Malabang, Lanao del Sur Regional Trial Court Branch 11. The case stemmed from a complaint filed by Gabriel Permitis, Alfredo Cano-os, Adonis Mendez, and Julito Janubas, who accused respondents of abducting them at a sawmill in Barangay Sandab, Butig, Lanao del Sur on April 4, 2016. The accused also allegedly abducted a certain Jaymart Capangpangan and Salvador Janubas, whom they beheaded six days later. The indictments were ordered in a 23-page resolution issued by Senior Assistant State Prosecutor Peter Ong, and approved by OIC-Senior Deputy State Prosecutor Amor Robles, and acting Prosecutor-General Jorge Catalan. The resolution gave weight to the kidnap victims’ testimonies that they saw Salic cleaning and guarding firearms in the place where they were held captive. They also alleged having overheard him give instructions to their captives to make sure they would not escape. The victims identified the accused as members of the Maute group, which waged attacks in Marawi City on May 23 last year, leading President Duterte to place the entire Mindanao under martial law."

"Malaysia detains 7 militants planning to kidnap, kill cops"	"Malaysia has detained seven militants suspected of planning attacks in the country, in several raids in Johor and Sabah. Members of a clandestine terror cell, which included two men working as janitors in Singapore, were planning to kidnap and kill policemen and attack non-Muslim houses of worship, police said in a statement yesterday. The plot was uncovered after Malaysian counter-terrorism police, aided by their Singaporean counterparts, detained the terror suspects in a series of swoops between Feb 27 and March 15. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said in a statement on Sunday that the authorities picked up the two Malaysians working in Singapore, who were said to be involved in terrorist plots in Malaysia, for investigations after they received information from the Malaysian authorities. ""Both men were handed over to the Malaysian authorities after our investigations showed that they did not pose a security threat to Singapore,” the statement said. The order to kidnap and kill policemen was the first of its kind, according to an intelligence source. ""This cell is extremely cautious... they are vengeful against the police, especially those from E8 (counter terrorism),"" an intelligence source told The Sunday Times. In a statement yesterday, Malaysia's police chief Mohamad Fuzi Harun said six suspects who were detained in Johor were members of an Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) cell. In the first round of arrests on Feb 27, three men were nabbed, with the main suspect being a 37-year-old technician who masterminded the plans to attack places of worship in Johor Baru. He was also actively recruiting new militants. Police picked up another three members of the same cell in follow-up sweeps on Feb 28. He said: ""The fourth suspect, a 25-year-old waiter, had been ordered by the mastermind to kidnap and kill policemen. ""Two others, aged 23 and 22, were arrested on March 1 and worked as janitors in Singapore. "" According to a Malaysian intelligence source, the two were arrested by Singaporean counterparts before they were handed over to the Malaysian police. ""Singapore was informed of the duo's alleged involvement in terrorism by Malaysia. They then tracked down and arrested the men before handing them over to the authorities here,"" the source said. The seventh suspect was a 31-year-old, said to be a ""trusted lieutenant"" in the Abu Sayyaf group in the Philippines. He was detained in Sabah on March 15. ""The Filipino man is a trusted lieutenant to Furuji Indama, the group's leader based in Basilan. ""We believe the suspect has connections to Malaysian militant, Dr Mahmud Ahmad, and is also wanted by the Philippine authorities for involvement in a kidnap-for-ransom syndicate. He is an expert in making improvised explosive devices and had planned to attack several locations in Sabah,"" Mr Fuzi said. Malaysia has arrested nearly 400 people since 2013 for suspected links to terrorism. The Muslim-majority nation faces threats from self-radicalised ISIS sympathisers at home, and regional militant groups which seek funding and refuge in South-east Asia. The country's first and only terrorist attack took place in June 2016, when two men on a motorcycle lobbed a grenade into a nightclub in Selangor, injuring eight people. The men were sentenced to 25 years' jail."	Terrorism	Terrorism
" Philippines files murder, kidnap charges against doctor linked to planned New York attacks"	"MANILA: The Philippine justice ministry has filed charges of murder and kidnapping against a doctor linked to a foiled plot to mount gun and bomb attacks in the heart of New York City, over his role in the abduction of six sawmill workers in a southern province. Prosecutors had set aside the alibi of Russel Salic, who said he was at a doctors' convention in another Philippine province when pro-Islamic State Maute militants kidnapped six sawmill workers and beheaded two of them in April 2016. ""Criminal liability exists, notwithstanding non-participation in every detail in the execution of the crime,"" prosecutors said in a document recommending charges against Salic and Maute militants. Reuters could not immediately reach Salic, his lawyer or other representatives by telephone or email to seek comment. The 37 year-old doctor has been detained at a maximum security facility in the capital, Manila, after he surrendered to authorities last year. In sworn statements, four sawmill workers said that while in captivity, they had seen Salic cleaning guns in a room full of weapons and that he had asked some of the militants to give them food and coffee. In his defence, Salic disputed the sawmill workers' story, insisting he was at an orthopedic convention and showing pictures to back up his account. But prosecutors ignored his alibi, saying the workers had no reason to fabricate stories. At about the time of the 2016 abduction, Salic, who had expressed support for Islamic State on social media, sent about US$423 from the Philippines to an FBI undercover officer to help pay for the attacks in New York, documents unsealed in a U.S. federal court show. U.S. authorities filed criminal charges against the 37-year-old doctor in October last year and wanted him extradited along with Pakistani Talha Haroon, who was also linked to the bomb plot in Manhattan's Times Square. But Salic could not immediately be sent to the United States because he faced charges of murder and kidnapping, along with 53 other pro-Islamic State militants, in the regional trial court in the southern Philippines. The justice department said the mother of the Maute brothers who led the militants' takeover of Marawi City for five months from May last year, was also charged. Some of Salic's co-accused had been killed in Marawi, including seven Maute brothers. Reuters could not immediately reach Omita Maute for comment."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Talk to Abu Sayyaf, Australian kidnap victim urges gov’t"	"ZAMBOANGA CITY — Like President Rodrigo Duterte, Australian kidnap victim Warren Rodwell said he favored talking to Abu Sayyaf bandits to determine what they really wanted, hoping to stop the group’s criminal activities. “I don’t want the Philippine government to kill or hurt my captors. The way to reach to them is to talk to them. If they are arrested, don’t kill [them]; put them behind bars,” Rodwell said through a Facebook chat on Sunday. Rodwell issued the statement after learning that Nurhassan Jamiri, the leader of the group that abducted him in 2011, had yielded to the military. The Basilan-based Jamiri surrendered to soldiers in Hadji Mohammad Ajul town on March 28 together with 13 Abu Sayyaf men, according to Lt. Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr., commander of the Western Mindanao Command. Jamiri and his men also turned in their firearms. The surrender took place two days after Mr. Duterte visited Patikul town in Sulu province and urged Abu Sayyaf bandits to yield and talk to him. Galvez described Jamiri’s surrender as a product of a successful negotiation and collaboration between government troops and local officials led by Basilan Gov. Jim Saliman Hataman, Isabela City Vice Mayor Cherilyn Akbar and Ustadz Hud Limaya, deputy commander of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front’s 114th Base Command. The latest surrender had brought to 202 the number of bandits who had turned themselves in since martial law was declared in Mindanao in May last year after Islamic State-inspired terror groups laid siege to Marawi City, Galvez added. Rodwell, who said he nearly died in captivity due to blood loss from a bullet wound, welcomed the surrender of Jamiri and the government’s commitment to provide them livelihood and housing. “Forgiveness and acceptance … I have no ill feelings against any of my … captors,” he said. Rodwell said people might question his position on the Abu Sayyaf problem, but he wanted to make them understand that the likes of Jamiri “were born into that situation (lawlessness).” Rodwell said the planned reintegration program for Abu Sayyaf bandits who surrendered to the government “sound[ed] wonderful.” “We can only hope that Abu Sayyaf members in custody are also trained for their own benefit,” he said. “Which is more important for society? Punishment or rehabilitation? Are these people any less human than we think we are?” He said it was not enough to simply identify a social problem, but “it’s more important to look at ways of minimizing or eliminating the impact of such.” Rodwell, however, said he would not drop the charges he filed against Jamiri and his other captors. “I’d leave it to the court. I’ll let it undergo the normal proceedings,” he said."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Taliban reject Afghan ceasefire, kidnap nearly 200 bus passengers"	"Peshawar, Pakistan, (ANTARANews) - The Taliban rejected on Monday an Afghan government offer of a ceasefire and said they would persist with their attacks, militant commanders said, while insurgents ambushed three buses and nearly 200 passengers travelling for a holiday. Two Taliban commanders said their supreme leader rejected President Ashraf Ghani`s Sunday offer of a three-month ceasefire, beginning with this week`s Eid al-Adha Muslim holiday. In June, the Taliban observed a government ceasefire over the three-day Eid al-Fitr festival, leading to unprecedented scenes of government soldiers and militants embracing on front lines, and raising hopes for talks. But one of the Taliban commanders said the June ceasefire had helped U.S. forces, who the Taliban are trying to drive out of the country. Taliban leader Sheikh Haibatullah Akhunzada rejected the new offer on the grounds that it too would only help the American-led mission. ""Our leadership feels that they`ll prolong their stay in Afghanistan if we announced a ceasefire now,"" a senior Taliban commander, who declined to be identified, said by telephone. An official in Ghani`s office said the three-month-long ceasefire declared by the government was conditional, and if the Taliban did not respect it, the government would maintain military operations. The Taliban have launched a wave of attacks in recent weeks, including on the city of Ghazni, southwest of Kabul. Hundreds of people have been killed in the fighting. Government officials are trying to secure the release of at least 170 civilians and 20 members of the security forces who were taken hostage by Taliban from three buses in the northern province of Kunduz. Esmatullah Muradi, a spokesman for the governor of Kunduz, said the kidnapping happened when the buses were travelling through Kunduz from Takhar province. ""The buses were stopped by the Taliban fighters, passengers were forced to step down and they have been taken to an undisclosed location,"" Muradi said. A Taliban commander in Afghanistan said civilian hostages were being divided into small groups to be sent back home. However, members of Afghan security forces had been shifted to the Talibans secret jail. ""Most probably we would exchange them for our prisoners later, said the commander. ""Travelling for holidary The Taliban confirmed they had captured ""three buses packed with passengers"". ""We decided to seize the buses after our intelligence inputs revealed that many men working with Afghan security forces were travelling to Kabul,"" Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, said by telephone, as reported by Reuters. ""We are now identifying members of the security forces,"" he said, adding that civilians would be released. Kunduz provincial council member Sayed Assadullah Sadat said people on the buses were travelling to be with family in Kabul for the holiday. A senior interior ministry official in Kabul said officials in the area were talking to Taliban leaders in Kunduz to get the estimated 190 hostages released. ""We`re are trying our level best to secure freedom for all passengers,"" the official said. Separately, Mujahid said the Taliban would release at least 500 prisoners, including members of the security forces, on Monday, a day before Eid celebrations begin. Sporadic clashes between Taliban fighters and Afghan forces erupted on the outskirts of Ghazni on Monday as aid workers tried to get help into the city, aid agency officials said. The government has said its forces had secured the city after the Taliban laid siege to it for five days this month. At least 150 soldiers and 95 civilians were killed and hundreds were injured. Aid agencies officials said their teams had entered the city but clashes in the outskirts prevented them from launching large-scale operations."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Taliban kidnap 3 passenger buses in Afghan northern Kunduz province	"Kunduz, Afghanistan, (ANTARANews) - Taliban militants kidnapped three passenger buses along with more than 150 passengers in Khan Abad district of Afghanistan`s northern Kunduz province on Monday, district governor Hayatullah Amiri said. ""The incident took place at 4:00 a.m. local time and the Taliban rebels forcibly took the buses to the villages under their control,"" Amiri told Xinhua. He said security forces had launched operations to ensure the safe release of the abducted passengers. Safiullah Mahzon deputy to Kunduz police chief has also confirmed the abduction of passenger buses, saying efforts are underway to set the hostages free. The abduction occurred just a day after Afghan President Mohammad Ashraf Ghani announced a three-month conditional ceasefire starting from Monday calling upon Taliban outfit to follow suit. Taliban group has yet to response to the government`s ceasefire offer."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Nigeria marks four-year anniversary of Chibok kidnap	"LAGOS, April 14 — Nigeria today marked four years since Boko Haram abducted more than 200 schoolgirls from the remote town of Chibok, with renewed calls for their release and that of thousands of others seized in the bloody conflict. A total of 219 girls were taken from the Government Girls Secondary School in the remote town in Borno state on the evening of April 14, 2014 and have become an enduring symbol of the Islamist insurgency. Four years on, 112 are still being held. Last night, about 100 people attended a vigil in Nigeria’s biggest city, Lagos, under a busy flyover whose pillars are now adorned with brightly painted murals of the missing girls. “We are here to show (the) government that we are still missing our sisters,” Zakaria Galang, a brother of one of the students who is yet to return, told AFP. Further events are planned in the capital, Abuja, today. Nigeria’s president in 2014, Goodluck Jonathan, was heavily criticised for his response to the abduction but the man who replaced him, Muhammadu Buhari, has had more success. Since 2016, 107 girls have been found, released or escaped as part of a government deal with Boko Haram and the administration has said back-channel talks are ongoing for further releases and a possible end to the wider conflict. Another activist, Habiba Balogun, said she hoped that would happen after nearly nine years of violence that has left at least 20,000 dead and made more than 2.6 million homeless. “The government has said that they are ready to negotiate; they want to bring this nightmare to an end,” she said. Buhari pledged to the Chibok girls’ parents that their daughters “will never be forgotten or abandoned to their fate” despite the time that had passed. The former military ruler has repeatedly claimed Boko Haram was virtually defeated but while there have been clear army gains, security threats remain. In February, fighters loyal to a Boko Haram faction headed by Abu Mus’ab al-Barnawi seized 112 schoolgirls and one boy from the town of Dapchi, in Yobe state. One hundred and seven were returned in mid-March. Five reportedly died, while one girl — the only Christian in the group — is still being held. Buhari said the return of so many students from Dapchi and Chibok “should give confidence that all hope is not lost” and showed the government was “doing its very best”. There had been “unexpected setbacks” in talks because of infighting within Boko Haram. But he added: “We will continue to persist, and the parents should please not give up. Don’t give up hope of seeing our daughters back home again.” Boko Haram has used kidnapping as a weapon of war during the conflict, seizing women and girls to act as sex slaves or suicide bombers, and men and boys to fight. UNICEF said this week more than 1,000 children had been verified as abducted in northeast Nigeria since 2013, although the real figure is estimated to be much higher. Amnesty International’s Nigeria director, Osai Ojigho, said the Chibok abduction was a small part of a bigger issue. The government needed to deliver “meaningful action on behalf of all these victims of Boko Haram’s crimes”. “Far more support must also be provided for past victims,” she said, proposing a register for abducted people. The International Crisis Group meanwhile said the copycat abduction in Dapchi showed more needed to be done to protect schoolchildren in the restive region. “The abductions illustrate that Boko Haram remains a menace to swathes of northeast Nigeria,” it added in a report published on Thursday. “They throw into doubt the government’s claim to have defeated the movement; instead, insurgents may be newly emboldened to keep fighting. “The kidnappings cast a pall over education, particularly of girls, and thus the prospects for socio-economic development of the region.”"	Terrorism	Terrorism
Easy for them to blend in': Foreign terror suspects pose security challenges for Malaysian authorities	"KUALA LUMPUR: When Malaysian police announced the arrest of eight terror suspects last Friday (Nov 16), it highlighted a particular problem authorities here face. That of foreigners entering Malaysia legally but who then go on to pursue militant activities. Seven of the eight suspects arrested last week were Filipinos, with some of them working in the country as labourers or construction workers in the eastern state of Sabah. The police said they were suspected of various activities, including recruiting children in the Philippines to be used as human shields and kidnap-for-ransom activities. The latest raids brought the total number of terror suspects arrested in Malaysia since 2013 to 445. More than a quarter of them - 128 - were foreigners. Some of these foreigners were directly involved in a number of attacks that were being planned by extremists, according to authorities. “We have foiled 23 terror attacks since 2013 - out of which three of those plots involved foreigners,” Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay, head of Malaysia's Special Branch counter-terrorism division, told Channel NewsAsia. The three plots, involving two Filipinos and two Indonesians, were disrupted in 2015, 2017 and 2018, said Ayob, who declined to elaborate further. Last year, Malaysian police said they had foiled a plan by the Abu Sayyaf Group to attack the closing ceremony of the Southeast Asian Games in Kuala Lumpur. The foreign suspects who have been arrested over the years have either been members or had ties with Islamic State (IS), Al-Qaeda, Pakistan’s Lashkar e-Taiba - the group behind the 2008 Mumbai attack - Abu Sayyaf, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and others. Filipinos comprised the largest group of foreign militants with 46 suspects detained, most of whom were alleged to be from the Abu Sayyaf, Ayob said. Indonesians represent the second largest group with 35 people arrested. Of the 445 terror suspects arrested since 2013, 189 suspects were charged in court with 161 of those convicted and jailed. Another 114 were freed, while 50 foreign terror suspects were deported, said the Special Branch. With police constantly on the trail of suspected foreign terror suspects, experts suggest that there are a number of factors which make Malaysia a popular destination for extremists looking to pursue activities outside their own countries. ""Malaysia is regarded as a Muslim-friendly country; also, visas are not needed for some Middle Easterners. This is exploited by foreign terrorist fighters,"" said counter-terrorism expert Ahmad el-Muhammady. ""And it's easy for them to blend in given the fact that many Middle Eastern communities are in Malaysia."" He added: ""There should also be better vetting of arrivals from Arab countries with well-trained (immigration) officers (who can speak) Arabic."" A former intelligence official, who investigated the 9/11 operatives who came to  Malaysia in 1999, told Channel NewsAsia it was not surprising that Al-Qaeda members were still coming to Malaysia. ""It shouldn't surprise us anymore,"" he said, requesting anonymity. ""It's easy to enter this country and lie low for a period of time. It could also suggest they have a support network here."" Foreign terrorists come to Malaysia for myriad reasons: Some are on the run from authorities in their own countries, some are seeking to raise funds. “Terror groups like Al-Qaeda have their own funds while JI and IS exploit the issue of oppression against Muslims to collect funds in Malaysia,” said Ayob. Adding to the challenge for the intelligence forces is the suspicion that Malaysia’s borders are more porous than they should be because of corrupt officials who do not conduct the proper security checks. ""It is imperative for the government to look into corruption at the entry and exit points of the country,"" said counter-terrorism expert Ahmad. In March 2017, police arrested an immigration officer in Sandakan, Sabah who allegedly helped arrange for IS militants from Indonesia and Malaysia to enter the eastern state before heading on to southern Philippines. And in September this year, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission arrested six immigration officers who allegedly assisted about 15 human smuggling syndicates to enable blacklisted locals and foreigners, including hardcore criminals, to enter and exit via Kuala Lumpur International Airport and other international airports in the country. On Nov 15, Malaysian police said that shortcomings in the immigration department's e-visa system had resulted in some people being allowed to enter the country despite being blacklisted or having criminal records. Deputy inspector-general of police Noor Rashid Ibrahim was quoted by Bernama as saying the weaknesses could pose a major threat to the country. ""So far, we are still collecting information and making analysis,"" he said. ""When the information is enough, we will conduct a special operation."" Recent arrests have shown that some terror suspects have managed to live and work undetected for years before being caught by police. Some of them set up their own companies either to hide their activities or to eke out a living while on the run from authorities back home. Others have worked as security guards, construction workers or petty traders. At least seven Abu Sayyaf members were working as security guards when they were arrested, according to police. The Philippines-based Abu Sayyaf is an IS-linked kidnap-for-ransom group known for beheading its victims when they fail to pay ransoms. Some foreign militants have worked as teachers spreading radical Salafi jihadi teachings, which underpin global terrorist groups like IS and Al-Qaeda. On Sep 24, police arrested seven foreigners and one Malaysian for spreading Salafi jihadi teachings in the northern state of Perlis. The foreigners comprised five Europeans, one American and a Middle Easterner. The threat from foreign extremists who are Al-Qaeda members or those who have links with the organisation is a growing concern for Malaysian authorities. Last October, the Special Branch arrested a 50-year-old former Al-Qaeda member in Selangor. The detained Egyptian suspect was an executive manager in an advertising company that he had set up. His firm promotes a property company from a Gulf state. “At this point, we only know that he set up his own company here. Investigations are still ongoing,” said counter-terrorism chief Ayob. Inspector-General of Police Mohd Fuzi Harun also said that the suspect had previously been jailed in Canada and Egypt for his involvement in terror activities and for using fake travel documents. “We need to conduct operations to disrupt Al-Qaeda because they have tried to use Malaysia as a base to plot their terror attacks,” said Ayob. ""Previously, the operatives of the 9/11 attacks quietly entered Malaysia in December 1999 to discuss the plot and then left and made their way to the US to carry out the attack in 2001."" In 1995, a senior Al-Qaeda member, Wali Khan Amin Shah, a co-conspirator in the plot to blow up 12 US-registered airliners in Asia, was also arrested in Malaysia. “Wali Khan had set up a company in Malaysia named Konsojaya Sendirian Berhad as a cover for his terror activities in Malaysia,” said Ayob, who investigated the case. Ayob warned of an Al-Qaeda resurgence as he called for vigilance. ""We have intel that shows that Al-Qaeda is strengthening its forces and their strategy is to be active again after the fall of IS.”"	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Maute group sniper nabbed by police in Cubao, QC"	"A hardcore sniper of the Islamic State-inspired Maute terrorist who survived in the last leg of the liberation of Marawi City last year was arrested by police operatives in Cubao, Quezon City Monday. The arrest came 15 days before the Marawi City siege anniversary. National Capital Region Police Office director Camilo Cascolan identified the Maute terrorist as Unday Macadato, who was collared by police operatives at his safehouse along Felix Manalo Street at 4:55 p.m. PNP Chief Oscar Albayalde along with Cascolan presented Unday to the media Tuesday morning in Camp Crame. Cascolan said the arrest of Unday were effected following a tip from an anonymous informant who reported a gun-toting man threatening passersby, bystanders and neighbors at his supposed hideout. Cascolan immediately dispatched police and intelligence units from the NCRPO headquarters led by Insp. Segundino Bulan and Supt. Andres Simbajon Jr. who went to the said address and eventually arrested Macadato. The Maute terrorist was in possession of a firearm and an explosive and tried to resist but was subdued by police operatives. Cascolan confirmed that Macadato was indeed n Maute member and is listed in the Martial Law Instruction No. 1.Reports said that Macadato was among the nearly thousands of combined Abu Sayyaf Group led by the late Isnilon Hapilon and Maute group who launched a simultaneous attack in Marawi City in May 23, 2017.Authorities could not yet establish as when and how Macadato was able to slip out at the main battle zone despite a heavy cordon put up by composite security forces at the height of the final chapter of Marawi City. The last bastion of the Maute group was decimated on October 23, the day President Rodrigo Duterte declared the liberation of Marawi from the clutches of the terrorists. Several hundreds of terrorists, soldiers and civilian hostages were killed during the siege. Both the military and police are still hunting the remnants of the terrorist group involved in the Marawi City siege who arebelieved hiding either in Lanao del Sur and adjoining provinces in Mindanao or in Metro Manila. Cascolan expressed his gratitude to the public for their trust and confidence to the police leading to the arrest of Macadato. “Immediate reporting of significant information. Concerns/complaints of the public to the police and the quick appropriate response of the police will eventually yield positive results,” Cascolan said."	Terrorism	Terrorism
 30 ISIS-inspired terrorists nabbed in Mindanao	"TACURONG CITY—Government troops and police arrested 30 Islamic State-inspired terrorists in a surprise commando-type offensive deep into their lair in the lakeshore town of Lutayan in Sultan Kudarat province, officials said Sunday. Police Supt. James Gulmatico, Sultan Kudarat police provincial director, said the operation by the 4th Special Action Battalion of the Police Special Action Force and the 33rd Infantry Battalion of the Philippine Army, took place in Markadz, Barangay Sisiman, Lutayan.  Gulmatico said the arrested men were being interrogated, and that the police will provide further updates later. Seized from the extremists were one M-16 automatic rifle; three homemade shotguns; two rifle grenade; two hand-held two-way radios, an improvised bomb with coiled electrical wire, a cellular phone for a triggering device, and nails. News of the successful raid came a day before Armed Forces chief Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr. opened the Balikatan joint Philippine-US military exercises on Monday. Galvez, who headed the overall Philippine military operations against the IS-inspired extremists in Marawi City, acknowledged how the US forces provided Filipino counterparts with “intelligence support in real time,” as well as ammunition, and other resources like rubber boats, firepower, and capability training.A lakeshore city, Lutayan town sits on a southern shore of Lake Buluan, similar to Marawi. In both cases, local officials were unaware of the presence of the extremists. Australia and Japan on Monday joined the humanitarian operations component of Balikatan 34, which is being held from May 7 to 18 in multiple locations in Luzon. The participating forces have already conducted a series of community engagement activities since April 19, the US Embassy said in a statement."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Kidnap release in Nigeria raises truce hopes in jihadist revolt	"As the Dapchi schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram were finally reuniting with their families, Nigeria delivered a small bombshell: it revealed it had begun ceasefire talks with the notorious jihadists. The talks began months ago, according to officials. But, to those desperate for a breakthrough in the bloody insurgency, they also caution that divisions among the militants may well hamper progress toward peace — and analysts say similar initiatives have foundered in the past. “Government is ever ready to accept the unconditional laying down of arms by any member of the Boko Haram group who show strong commitment,” President Muhammadu Buhari said on Friday when he met the schoolgirls in Abuja, the national capital. “We are ready to rehabilitate and integrate such repented member(s) into the larger society,” said Buhari. “This country has suffered enough of hostilities.” A total of 111 schoolgirls were abducted by Boko Haram from the northeastern town of Dapchi on February 19 in the largest mass kidnapping since 2014 when over 200 schoolgirls were taken from Chibok. In a scene that shocked many Nigerians, the jihadists returned to the town in an unobstructed convoy, flying the black Boko Haram flag, to drop off most of the girls. Six girls are still missing, including one who was held back for refusing to renounce Christianity. The five others are believed to have died in the initial stages of the kidnapping. Information Minister Lai Mohammed said that a week-long ceasefire was declared on March 19 as part of “intense back channel” negotiations to allow Boko Haram to return the hostages. The Nigerian government has repeatedly denied paying a ransom or releasing imprisoned Boko Haram fighters in exchange for the schoolgirls. “The insurgents’ only condition was their demands for a cessation of hostilities and a temporary ceasefire to enable them to return the girls (to) the point they picked them (up),” explained Lawal Daura, a senior security official, on Friday. The talks with Boko Haram explored the “permanent, possible cessation of hostilities” and the “possibility of granting amnesty to repentant insurgents,” Daura said. But he warned that achieving success would be “problematic” since the group is splintered into rival camps. A source close to the Dapchi negotiations told AFP that the government has been negotiating with the Islamic State-affiliated Abu Mus’ab al-Barnawi faction of Boko Haram. Al-Barnawi, the son of deceased Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf, leads one faction, while Abubakar Shekau, Yusuf’s former deputy, leads another. “Talks have been ongoing between the government and the insurgents from the Al-Barnawi faction,” said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. The source said peace talks began in earnest after the July 2017 ambush on an oil exploration team in Lake Chad that killed at least 69 people. “The major headache now is extending the talks to the Shekau faction which is averse to negotiations,” said the source. Striking a deal with one faction doesn’t guarantee that the other faction will follow, said security analyst Ryan Cummings. “You’re not talking to a homogenous, centralised insurgent group,” said Cummings. “Boko Haram is an umbrella movement comprised of various factions motivated for different reasons, some ideological, others profit, some might be a combination.” Others fear that the talks are being used as a diversion by Boko Haram to regroup. “The military is opposed to negotiations with the militant groups, especially on release of hostages, which is believed to mostly involve ransom payment,” said another source close to the talks. “The military sees Boko Haram using the halt to buy time.” It’s not the first time Nigeria has talked about a ceasefire with Boko Haram. In 2014, former president Goodluck Jonathan’s government claimed it had brokered a deal with the militants, though Boko Haram attacks continued quickly soon after. Then, as now, experts questioned the legitimacy and influence of the rebel negotiators. Shortly after being elected in 2015, Buhari said he was mulling amnesty for Boko Haram fighters. “If the Boko Haram leadership eventually agrees to turn over the Chibok girls to us — the complete number — then we may decide to give them (the prisoners) amnesty,” said Buhari at the time. “We’ve had previous conversations about ceasefire that turned out to be illusions,” said political analyst Chris Ngwodo. “The distinction here is that this appears to be a specific initiative targeted at a specific faction of Boko Haram,” said Ngwodo. “Perhaps for the first time, at least publically, the federal government is trying to exploit the factions.”"	Terrorism	Terrorism
India confirms deaths of 39 workers abducted in Iraq	"The bodies of 39 Indian construction workers kidnapped in Iraq in 2014 by the Islamic State group have been found in a mass grave, India's foreign minister said Tuesday. Sushma Swaraj told the upper house of parliament the workers had been murdered by IS. Their bodies had been found in the grave in the village of Badush northwest of the city of Mosul and taken to a local organization for DNA testing. ""Yesterday they told us that 38 samples had matched. The 39th had a partial match as he didn't have any immediate family,"" said Swaraj. The workers were abducted in June 2014 when IS jihadists overran large swathes of territory in Iraq and captured Mosul. The government had for years insisted they were believed still alive and the latest announcement sparked criticism from some relatives of the dead. The victims were mostly from poor families in India's northern state of Punjab and had been working for a construction company in Mosul when they were rounded up. ""We got to know that these people were moved from Mosul to Badush by their captors,"" Swaraj said. When India's junior foreign minister Vijay Kumar Singh and Iraqi government officials went to Badush, someone told them to inspect a mound in the village, the minister added. ""They said that they had buried many people there (in a mass grave). We reached there and requested Iraqi authorities to use a deep penetration radar, which detected many bodies under the surface,"" she told parliament. When the area was excavated, Indian officials found many identification marks such as non-Iraqi shoes and Sikh religious bangles. ""We felt these were our people... contacted a foundation working on the issue and shared missing workers' families' DNA samples with them for the identification process,"" the foreign minister told parliament. The Indian government had never received any ransom demand or any other direct communication from the kidnappers. A special plane will bring 38 of the 39 bodies home after formalities are completed in Iraq. The DNA matching process is still incomplete for the final victim. ""Howsoever painful, the families will get the dead bodies after over three years. This will hopefully bring some closure to the grieving families,"" Swaraj said. Some relatives, however, criticised the government. ""For the last four years the same minister has been telling me that we have traced their location and they're alive,"" Gurpinder Kaur, sister of one of the dead workers, told reporters in Punjab. ""I only heard what the minister said on television. I have no other information about it. I am waiting for her to contact me but I don't know what to trust,"" she added. Punjab state's chief minister Amarinder Singh described it as ""heart-wrenching news"". ""My heart goes out to the families who had been living in hope since their reported abduction by ISIS in 2014. Prayers with all of them,"" he said, using another acronym for the Islamic State. Shashi Tharoor, a lawmaker from the main opposition Congress party, told journalists the government had not done right by the families. ""If the government didn't have any details, why did they keep telling everyone they are alive? The government cheated the people (families) by giving them false hope for four years,"" he said. At a press conference later, Swaraj denied the government had given families false hope, insisting it had needed proof before confirming any deaths. The minister also could not say when the hostages had been killed."	Terrorism	Terrorism
13 BIFF gunmen slain in AFP offensive in Maguindanao	"COTABATO CITY–At least 13 Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) gunmen were killed in three days of military assault against the alleged Islamic State-linked group in Maguindanao since Monday. Nine BIFF members also yielded as the military continued to conduct air strikes and artillery fires, in addition to ground assaults in the towns of Shariff Saydona Mustapha, Datu Saudi Ampatuan, Datu Salibo, Mamasapano, and Shariff Aguak since April 9, said Capt. Arvin Encinas, spokesperson of the Army’s 6th Infantry Division. Encinas said two soldiers were injured in the clashes. They were checking if BIFF commanders Karialan, Bungos and Abu Toraife were among those killed, Encinas said. Maj. Gen. Arnel dela Vega, 6th ID commander, said 20 firearms were recovered in the operations while two BIFF camps had been captured. “Our troops utilized all available air assets, artillery as well as armor assets in support of the ground operations of the different field units,” dela Vega said. He said the operation against the BIFF would continue. Encinas said the surrender of the nine BIFF guerrillas was facilitated by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). He also confirmed that over 2,300 individuals had fled the clashes and were being assisted by various local government units."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Philippines says suspect Islamist militant recruiter arrested	" MANILA, Feb 19 — Philippine security forces have arrested a foreigner suspected of recruiting domestic fighters for pro-Islamic State militant groups, including an alliance that occupied a southern city for five months last year, police said today. Director-General Ronald dela Rosa paraded before the media Fehmi Lassoued and his Filipino girlfriend, Anabel Salipada, three days after they were arrested in a rented apartment a few blocks away from the US embassy in Manila, the capital. “A thorough investigation is now underway to determine the extent of their involvement with international and domestic threat groups,” dela Rosa said, adding that an undisclosed foreign intelligence ally gave details of Lassoued’s identity and activities. Police also displayed handguns, ammunition and components for making improvised explosive devices and an Islamic State black flag, which were confiscated from Lassoued and Salipada. “Most likely, he is here with the intention to recruit ISIS sympathisers in Mindanao,” dela Rosa said, using another acronym for Islamic State. He said Lassoued has been travelling to Malaysia, the Philippines and Turkey in the last two years and first arrived in Manila in June 2016 on a Tunisian passport, which was found to be fake. Lassoued was born in the United Arab Emirates and is of Libyan and Tunisian descent but lived in Syria for many years, he added. The suspect may have helped recruit for the pro-Islamic State Maute group, which led a siege of southern Marawi City last year, he added. Appearing before a prosecutor, Lassoued denied the police allegations. He said he had fled Syria as Islamic State militants sought to establish a foothold there. "	Terrorism	Terrorism
 Paris attacks suspect silent as trial begins	" BRUSSELS, Feb 5 — The prime surviving suspect in the 2015 Islamic State attacks on Paris went on trial in Brussels today, accused of the attempted murder of police shortly before his arrest in Belgium two years ago. Salah Abdeslam, 28, entered the court for his first public appearance since the attacks that killed 130 people in Paris in November 2015. In contrast to the time of his arrest four months later in his native Brussels, Belgian public broadcaster RTBF reported that he had long hair and a beard. Despite hopes in Paris that Abdeslam might break more than two years of silence on the carnage, RTBF said he told the court that he would not answer questions and refused to stand when the judge read out the charges against him.

"Hapilon's follower, Abu Sayyaf member nabbed in Zambo"	"ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines — A follower of slain Abu Sayyaf and Islamic State leader Isnilon Hapilon and another member were arrested separately by the police intelligence unit in this city, a police official said Saturday here. Chief Superintendent Billy Beltran, director of Police Regional Office 9, identified one of the suspects as Radulat Balito, a follower of Hapilon. Hapilon, who left Basilan and established ties with the Maute Group, was named as the emir of the IS for Southeast Asia. He was killed during the military offensive that liberated Marawi City in October last year. Beltran said the other arrested Abu Sayyaf member was Isah Sampal, also known as Sonny Abubakar. Balito was arrested on Friday about 7:50 a.m. by members of the Regional Intelligence Division unit under Superintendent Fergen Torred at Barangay Recodo, a west coast village this city. Sampal, on the other hand, was arrested about 7 a.m. Saturday by the same police intelligence unit at Barangay Mariki, a coastal village destroyed at the height of the 2013 siege. Beltran said both suspects were facing charges of kidnapping and serious illegal detention in connection with the mass abduction of plantation workers of Golden Harvest Inc. at Barangay Tairan, Lantawan on June 11, 2001. The two suspects were positively identified by witness, who are under the Witness Protection and Security Benefit Program of the Department of Justice. Based on the accounts of the witness, the two were among those who joined the Abu Sayyaf group who abducted around seven to 15 workers. Five victims were then executed. According to witnesses and kidnap victims, about 70 Abu Sayyaf group members were involved during the raid in the plantation. Read more at "	Terrorism	Terrorism

Seven militants who planned to attack places of worship arrested	"KUALA LUMPUR: Seven more suspected militants planning attacks in Malaysia, including at places of worship have been arrested in separate operations in Johor and Sabah. Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi Harun said in the first operation on Feb 27 conducted by the Counter Terrorism Police department, three suspects between 30 and 49 were arrested in Johor Baru. He said checks showed the three were planning to attack non-muslim prayer house and temples in the state. ""A 37 year old engineer at a private company, who was among the 3 arrested turned out to be the mastermind responsible for planning the attacks as well as for recruting new IS members. “Another suspect, a 49-year old who worked as a security guard was responsible to ensure that the recruits kept the secrecy of the group. ""He did this by threatening to kill anyone who leaked the information, "" he said. Fuzi said the third suspect was responsible for securing firearms and weapons by smuggling them from a neighbouring country. He said the third suspect had also gone to some of the non Muslim houses of worship in Johor to survey the locations and lay the ground work for the attacks. “The suspects had planned to flee to a neighbouring country after launching the attacks,” he said in a statement. Fuzi said police had conducted a follow up operation and arrested another three members of the same cell between Feb 28 and March 1. The fourth suspect picked up in a follow up operation was a 25 year old cafe waiter who received orders to kidnap and murder policemen who came in their way. “The orders were from the first and third suspects,"" he said. Fuzi said two more suspects - aged 22 and 23 who worked as cleaners in Singapore - were also arrested for allegedly playing middlemen roles in the arms deal. Meanwhile in an unrelated case in Sabah, Fuzi said 31-year-old right hand man of Furuji Indama (the head of the Abu Sayyaf militant group in Basilan, Southern Philippines) was arrested in a counter terrorism operation on Mar 15. ""The suspect had a very good and close relationship with Dr Mahmud Ahmad (A Malaysian militant who joined IS in the Phillipines). “He was also on the Phillipines government's wanted list for several kidnapping for ransom cases and attempted murders,” he said, adding the militant was an expert in making improvised explosive devices (IED). Fuzi said all those detained were being investigated for having links with terrorist groups and had been held under the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 (Sosma) and Section 574 of the Penal Code."

Italian priest kidnapped overnight near Niger's southern border	"NIAMEY: An Italian priest was kidnapped on Monday in south Niger, near the border with Burkina Faso, the second abduction of a European in the West African country this year. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the kidnapping, which was confirmed on Tuesday by the Nigerien and Italian governments. West African states have been struggling to gain the upper hand over jihadist groups, including some affiliated with al Qaeda and Islamic State, which are active along Niger's porous borders with both Mali and Burkina Faso. The kidnapping took place in the village of Bomanga, in the southern Makalondi district, about 125 km (80 miles) from the capital Niamey. In a statement on Tuesday, Niamey's Archbishop Laurent Lompo said Father Pier Luigi Maccalli was attacked and abducted by ""unidentified individuals"" on Monday evening. Maccalli had been working in Bomaga for 11 years as a member of the Society of African Missions (SMA), a Roman Catholic missionary organization. Italy's embassy in Niamey has called on the local authorities to resolve the matter as quickly as possible, the Italian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Western powers, primarily France but also the United States, have deployed thousands of troops in the semi-arid Sahel region to combat what they see as a growing Islamist militant threat that targets both civilians and the military. In April, a German humanitarian worker was abducted by men riding motorcycles near Niger's western border with Mali. Last October the Islamic State's affiliate in West Africa claimed responsibility for an attack in Niger's borderlands that killed four members of the U.S. special forces and at least four Nigerien soldiers. ""What is worrying us in particular is a bigger capacity of these terrorist groups to act, especially near the three borders,"" said a French diplomatic source, referring to Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso. France has some 4,500 troops in the area."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Malaysian police arrest 8 terror suspects, including Abu Sayyaf members"	"KUALA LUMPUR: Eight terror suspects, including six members of the notorious kidnap-for-ransom Abu Sayyaf Group, were arrested in a series of raids recently, Malaysian police said on Friday (Nov 16).  The men were arrested in a sting operation conducted by the counter-terrorism division of the police's Special Branch between Oct 30 and Nov 12 in Sabah and Putrajaya, Inspector-General of Police Fuzi Harun said in a statement. One of the Filipino suspects was arrested in Ranau, Sabah. Police said he was recruiting children in the Philippines to be used as human shields. ""The 35-year-old suspect played the role of recruiting children to join Abu Sayyaf to be used as human shields during fighting with the Philippine military in Basilan,"" said Fuzi. ""He has also been involved in beheading hostages held by the Abu Sayyaf,"" he added. The man, who was working as a construction worker, was arrested in a sting operation that also netted another Filipino Abu Sayyaf suspect, aged 46, who was working as a technician. Both men are also involved in kidnap-for-ransom activities in Sabah and the southern Philippines. ""At the time of the arrests, both suspects were planning to escape to southern Philippines to avoid being arrested by Malaysian authorities,"" said Fuzi.  The arrests come in the wake of a Sep 11 kidnapping of two Indonesian fishermen in the waters off Sabah. Abu Sayyaf is notorious for kidnapping people for ransom and beheading its hostages when victims cannot pay up. The group ply the Sulu Seas and make bold incursions into the east coast of Sabah to snatch their victims. Another Abu Sayyaf member, aged 30,  was arrested in Kinarut, Sabah. He was a sub-commander and right-hand man of the group's commander Furuji Indama, said police. Another three Abu Sayyaf suspects, aged between 27 and 51 and who were working as labourers, were arrested in Tenom, Sabah. ""One of the suspects, aged 34, has expertise in producing firearms for the use of Abu Sayyaf,"" said Fuzi. Another Filipino man, 60, who worked as a petty trader in a night market, was arrested for his involvement in protecting one of the suspects who was arrested on Nov 8 as he was trying to run away from a police dragnet. In addition, a 38-year-old Malaysian man, who worked as an agent selling gold bars, was arrested in Putrajaya for channelling funds to a Malaysian Islamic State member Akel Zainal in Syria in 2017 to fund terror activities."

Kidnappers expected to strike again in Sabah as militants seek funds for terror activities	"SANDAKAN, Sabah: A sense of unease has overcome parts of the east Malaysian state of Sabah on Borneo island after a kidnapping incident off the waters of the coastal town of Semporna last week (Sep 11). Masked men armed with M16s, allegedly linked to the notorious kidnap-for-ransom Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) based in southern Philippines’ Mindanao island, snatched two Indonesian men from a fishing vessel.  It was the first such incident Sabah has seen in almost two years. Now there are concerns that they could strike again in a bid to raise funds for terror activities in the southern Philippines. That warning comes from an intelligence official and a former militant. A combination of Islamic State’s (IS) call to arms in Mindanao and the Philippine military’s operations against militants are pushing ASG to seek funds through kidnapping. Likewise, poverty in southern Philippines makes for easy recruits by militants and kidnapping gangs. “This incident (kidnapping) is something that is difficult to stop. However, it (situation) is under control,” Ayob Khan Mydin Pitchay, head of Special Branch counter-terrorism division, told Channel NewsAsia. Special Branch is the intelligence arm of the Royal Malaysian Police and the lead agency in counter-terrorism operations. “The kidnappings are still occurring because these groups (ASG) are pressured to seek funds to continue with their (militant) activities as Filipino authorities are conducting clearance operations against militants,” Ayob added. According to Eastern Sabah Security Command (Esscom) chief Hazani Ghazali, events in Philippines have a significant impact on Sabah. “Whatever happens in Philippines will impact on Sabah.  Sabah is a very important border for the whole of Malaysia and the Sulu sea,” said Hazani. “ASG and pro-Islamic State groups (in southern Philippines) need money for their daily needs, mobilisation from one place to another, procurement of communication equipment and weapons,” Abdullah Sandakan, a former member of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) militant group that has ties with Abu Sayyaf, told Channel NewsAsia. “The recent kidnapping … to get money to fund small acts of terrorism ... moving in the direction for something similar like Marawi,” said Abdullah. Pro-Islamic State militants, including a faction of ASG, seized control of Marawi in May 2017 and laid siege to the city for five months. More than 1,000 were killed in the fighting. It was Islamic State’s most serious assault to gain a foothold into Southeast Asia, unsettling governments across the region. Prior to Marawi’s siege, Sabah and the surrounding Sulu Sea experienced a spike in kidnappings, jumping to 10 incidents in 2016 versus one incident in 2015. According to Abdullah, the 2016 kidnappings were to raise funds for the battle in Marawi. “You see how many kidnappings took place prior to the Marawi siege? It was to raise funds for Marawi. Kidnapping was the easiest way as you get cash,” said Abdullah. “Yes, those kidnappings (2016) were for Marawi,” Hazani told Channel NewsAsia. The latest kidnapping is the first in almost two years as joint maritime patrol launched in 2017 by Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines at the Sulu Sea helped to reduce incidents of piracy and kidnappings. As IS loses its territories in Syria and Iraq, it has called on its followers to go to Mindanao island to fight, saying it is the new “land of jihad"". Moreover, Turkey and other countries have tightened up their borders with Syria. “This in turn has diverted militants to southern Philippines who is also pro-IS,” said Ayob Khan. Since 2013, 41 militants were nabbed for attempting to enter into Mindanao through Sabah. Of that number, 27 were foreigners who were mainly Indonesians. Sabah is an important jumping off point for Malaysians and foreign fighters wishing to wage jihad in Mindanao given its close proximity to southern Philippines. According to former JI member Abdullah, foreign fighters enter Sabah through the east coast towns of Lahad Datu, Tawau, Kunak and Semporna. Abdullah said he knows this route well - he used to smuggle foreign fighters from Indonesia through the same route. But increased operations from Esscom has led militants to use a new route on the west coast of Sabah. “They (foreign fighters) are now starting to use Indonesia’s Kalimantan-Keningau route on the West coast to enter Sabah to avoid increased operations on the east coast,” said Esscom chief Hazani. Similiarly, Sabah is also a gateway for ASG members and other foreign fighters to escape from Philippine military operations to travel all the way to Peninsular Malaysia. “From Semenanjung (Peninsular), they can fly to anywhere in the world via Kuala Lumpur airport.,” said Esscom’s Hazani. Since 2013, a total of 27 Abu Sayyaf members have been arrested by police in Malaysia. “They (ASG) come to Malaysia to hide ... they are usually wanted in the Phillppines. There are some of them who come here to get away from their past life with ASG. However, they will still give their support to ASG,” said Ayob. Once in Kuala Lumpur, ASG members were reported to be working as security guards, labourers and members of a paramilitary civilian volunteer corp known as RELA. “A total of seven ASG members were arrested while working as security guards,” said Ayob. ASG also tried to recruit new members in Malaysia to join them in southern Philippines, he added. Last year, Malaysian police foiled a plan by ASG to attack the closing ceremony of the Southeast Asian Games in Kuala Lumpur. NO END IN SIGHT TO PRO-IS GROUPS FIGHTING IN MINDANAO “Their (IS) movement will continue with no end in sight as the death of one leader, meaning Isnilon Hapilon, will be replaced by another,” said ex-JI member Abdullah. ASG also has access to weapons which they buy from the black market. “ASG gets most of their weapons from the black market. They also have their own arms-producing factory,” said Andrin Raj, Southeast Asia regional director, of International Association for Counter terrorism and Security Professionals (IACSP). JI’s Abdullah also warned that pro-IS groups’ fighting capacity in southern Philippines was becoming more strategic and “integrated” as foreign fighters trained in urban warfare were converging there. “This is a solid convergence of warfare – you have foreign fighters trained in urban warfare that fought in Syria combined with ASG that knows jungle warfare,” said Abdullah."

 Philippines says eight jihadists killed in the south	"MANILA, March 9 — The Philippine military said today it had killed at least eight Islamic militants in an operation to stop jihadist efforts to set up base in the country’s south following the deadly five-month siege of Marawi city last year. Armoured vehicles and artillery were used against about 50 gunmen from the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) on Mindanao island yesterday, local military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Gerry Bisana said in a report. The military said last month that gunmen linked to the Islamic State group have renewed an armed campaign to set up a caliphate in the region, home to the Catholic nation’s Muslim minority. A first attempt was put down last year after a US-backed military campaign that flattened Marawi and left more than 1,100 people dead. Survivors of the Marawi siege have recruited a fresh force of about 200 gunmen, according to the military, with President Rodrigo Duterte warning they could attack other Mindanao cities. Bisana said troops recovered the bodies of eight gunmen, although they believe the militants carried off 15 other dead comrades. He added that a soldier was also wounded in the fighting near the town of Datu Saudi Ampatuan. “Soldiers have been vigilantly guarding the entire central Mindanao in order to constrict the firefight in specific... areas, and continue to pursue the remnants of the terror group,” regional military chief Major-General Arnel dela Vega said. The BIFF is a splinter group of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the country’s largest Muslim guerrilla force that signed a peace treaty with Manila in 2014 after a decades-long armed campaign that claimed more than 100,000 lives by official estimates. The MILF has echoed Duterte’s warnings in recent months, as the two sides pushed to get Congress to pass a Muslim self-rule law that both said would help roll back jihadist gains in Mindanao."

Tillerson says US Mideast peace plan 'fairly well advanced'	"AMMAN, Feb 14 — The United States’s work on a new Middle East peace plan is “fairly well advanced”, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said today, though he provided no details on an initiative which comes amid deep Palestinian scepticism about US intentions. Tillerson, who was speaking during a visit to Jordan to sign a five-year US$6.4 billion (RM25.09 billion) aid package that extends US support to a key Arab ally, said President Donald Trump would decide when to announce the peace plan. The United States infuriated even its Arab allies in December when Trump recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and initiated the move of the US embassy from Tel Aviv. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he would not cooperate with the United States in its efforts as a mediator. “I have seen the (administration’s peace) plan... It’s been under development for a number of months. I have consulted with them on the plan, identified areas that we feel need further work. I will say it’s fairly well advanced...” Tillerson said. There has been little detail on the plan so far. Officials told Reuters in December it would deal with all major issues, including Jerusalem, borders, security, the future of Jewish settlements on occupied land and the fate of Palestinian refugees, and would also urge Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states to provide significant financial support to the Palestinians. The plan is being crafted by a team led by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, and US Middle East envoy Jason Greenblatt, both of whom have travelled to key regional capitals since the Trump administration came to office. Palestinians have grown increasingly concerned that any plan Trump unveils will shortchange them, a fear exacerbated by his move on Jerusalem, which upended decades of US policy that the status of the ancient city must be decided in negotiations. Jerusalem is home to sites holy to Muslims, Jews and Christians. Jordanian King Abdullah’s Hashemite dynasty is the custodian of the Muslim holy sites, making Amman particularly sensitive to any changes of status there. The king has warned that Trump’s decision could undermine stability and fuel radicalism. Jordanian foreign minister Ayman al-Safadi reiterated on Wednesday that a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was the “only solution we believe can work”. The Trump administration has said it would back a two-state solution if the parties agreed to it. Trump had threatened to cut off financial aid to countries that backed a UN resolution calling for Washington to reverse its Jerusalem decision. Jordan backed the resolution. But the Trump administration has courted King Abdullah, a moderate pro-Western Arab leader whose kingdom has long upheld US interests in a turbulent region. On Wednesday Tillerson met the king at his personal residence where the two emphasised strong US-Jordanian ties. Commenting on the memorandum of understanding signed for US$6.375 billion in aid on Wednesday, the US State Department said: “(It) highlights the pivotal role Jordan plays in helping foster and safeguard regional stability and supports US objectives such as the global campaign to defeat ISIS, counter-terrorism cooperation, and economic development.” ISIS is an acronym for the militant Islamic State group. Conflicts in neighbouring Syria and Iraq have damaged Jordan’s economy, forcing it to borrow heavily from external and domestic sources. Jordan has been an important part of the US-led coalition battling Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Tillerson is also expected this week to visit Turkey, with which US ties have become badly strained over Washington’s support for the Kurdish YPG militia in Syria, regarded by Ankara as a terrorist group. Tillerson said Washington had to “find a way to continue to work in the same direction”. He also expressed concern over Saturday’s confrontation between Israel and “Iranian assets” in Syria. Syrian air defences shot down an Israeli F-16 jet after it bombed a site used by Iran-backed forces in Syria. Tillerson said Iran should withdraw its forces and militias from Syria, where Tehran backs President Bashar al-Assad. Responding to the comments, a senior Iranian official, Ali Akbar Velayati, said Iran’s military presence in Syria was legitimate and based on an invitation from Damascus. He called on US forces to leave Syria."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Troops capture Abu Sayyaf subleader after firefight in Sulu	" ZAMBOANGA CITY – The military on Sunday said an Abu Sayyaf subleader who was wounded during a recent firefight was captured during another clash in Patikul, Sulu on Saturday. At the same time, the military denied a claim by the Islamic State that three soldiers were killed in Saturday’s firefight in Patikul. Brig. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, the commander of Joint Task Force Sulu, said soldiers under the 32nd Infantry Battalion were conducting a search-and-rescue operation for Abu Sayyaf kidnap victims when informed that Walton Juljirin and four of his men were hiding in Sitio Kan Bading in Barangay Taung. Sobejana said the soldiers went to check the reported hiding place of Juljirin and his men and clashed with the bandits. He said Juljirin’s four men fled during the five minute firefight but left behind the Abu Sayyaf subleader, who had difficulty moving because of an infected wound. “Our soldiers eventually captured Walton Juljirin, the ASG subleader during the clearing operation,” Sobejana said. Lt. Col. Ronaldo Mateo, the 32nd IB commander, said none of his men was harmed during the clash. Mateo said also recovered were a 7.62-mm FN-G1 rifle, some magazines and ammunition, suspected improvised explosive devices, and two hand grenades. He said the captured subleader was immediately given medical attention before being brought to the headquarters of the 501st Brigade in Barangay Tagbak in Indanan town. “The group of Walton Juljirin is under the group of ASG sub-leader Mundi Sawadjaan (a nephew of ASG leader Hajan Sawadjaan). His group was responsible in the series of IED and roadside bombings along the highway of Patikul, Sulu. Also, Juljirin’s group is the liquidation squad of Sawadjaan’s group,” said Lt. Gen. Carlito Galvez, Jr., the commander of the Western Mindanao Command. Galvez said Juljirin was the 14thAbu Sayyaf member captured since Jan. 1 this year. “With the capture of Juljirin, we are optimistic that we will gain more grounds and soon defeat the Abu Sayyaf here in the island province,” Galvez added. He said since January up to end-March, 11 bandits had already been killed in military operations in Sulu while 60 others had surrendered. “Our priority is to find and rescue the remaining kidnap victims who are still in Sulu area. We are currently doubling our efforts towards that goal,” Galvez added. "	Terrorism	Terrorism
Two Indonesian fishermen kidnapped in Malaysia`s Semporna waters	"Kota Kinabalu, (ANTARA News) - A group of armed people reportedly abducted two Indonesian fishermen working on a local fishing vessel in Semporna waters in the Malaysian state of Sabah early Tuesday. The local media reported that the group of people, armed with M-16 rifles, ascended the fishing boat and abducted two crew members at around 1 a.m. local time. Two other crew members survived the abduction attempt, as they hid in one of the fishing boat`s compartments. They later reported the incident to the police in Semporna. Both the police and the Eastern Sabah Security Command (ESSCOM) confirmed the abduction, which is the first of its kind in the past two years. Spokesman for Sabah Police Omar Mammah confirmed the abduction, saying that the police are still investigating the motive behind the abduction. ""At around midnight, two people, armed with M-16 rifles, abducted (two fishermen) in the waters of Gaya Island,"" he stated. He noted that the two fishermen were sailing on a boat when the armed group kidnapped them and then took them to an unknown location. ""We believe the abduction case has to do with a kidnap-for-ransom (KFR) group. However, we have yet to receive any request from any party for ransom,"" he remarked.

"ASEAN, Australia forge historic anti-terror pact"	"THE Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Australia on Saturday sealed a historic agreement seeking to bolster regional security, with the joint signing of the memorandum of understanding on a Cooperation to Counter International Terrorism on the sidelines of the Asean-Australia Special Summit. Leading the Philippine government delegation was Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano, who represents President Rodrigo Duterte for the two-day leaders’ dialogue in Sydney. The MOU is aimed at strengthening the cooperation between the two parties in combating terrorism, counter-terrorism financing, and in the fight against violent extremism. In a joint statement, the leaders stressed that the crafting of the MOU demonstrates their “joint resolve to stand together” against those who seek to divide communities. The document intensifies Australia’s annual engagement with the bloc and enshrines practical measures to deepen dialogue across governments and security and law enforcement institutions. The MOU is supported by programs on technical and regulatory assistance to develop best practices in aid of counter-terrorism legislation, and regional dialogues and workshops on topics, such as electronic evidence, financial intelligence, and countering online radicalization. “Asean nations have a strong record of working together to confront violent extremism and defeat terrorist organizations,” the joint statement read. “In recent years the threat posed  by returning foreign fighters and ISIL-linked extremists has grown. It makes today’s cooperation all the more important,” it added. The MOU signing adds to the numerous peace and security cooperation between the two parties, which ranges from cyber and maritime cooperation, in their fight against people trafficking.  In related developments: • Australia on Saturday warned the use of encrypted messaging apps to plan terrorist attacks was the greatest threat faced by intelligence agencies in modern times and urged a “united and cohesive” response. Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton told an Asean-Australia special summit in Sydney that the use of the “dark web” by extremists and other criminals was a spiraling problem. “The use of encrypted messaging apps by terrorists and criminals is potentially the most significant degradation of intelligence capability in modern times,” he said. Dutton added at the meeting of Southeast Asian leaders that the only way to deal with the threat, and the increasing use of the Internet by groups like Islamic State to radicalize and recruit new members, was together. “While our nations are focused on countering the ongoing threat of terrorism domestically, it would be a mistake to approach the problem from a purely national perspective,” he said. “Terrorism and violent extremism transcend national borders.  “Countering the threat requires a united and cohesive regional effort involving coordination between our respective national security and law enforcement agencies.” Canberra is already helping Southeast Asian states choke terrorist financing and counter violent extremism.• Provocative images of one-time human rights icon Aung San Suu Kyi with a Hitler moustache and banners demanding Cambodia’s Hun Sen step down were held by protesters in Sydney in a rally against Southeast Asian leaders. Thousands demonstrated in the city against a raft of grievances on the sidelines of an Australia-Asean special summit, where Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has vowed to tackle human rights issues. They came together to urge the release of political prisoners in Vietnam, an end to strongman Hun Sen’s regime in Cambodia and a halt to the military crackdown on Rohingya in Myanmar. “We are here to protest issues that are happening in Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, the Rohingya—you name it, we are here to send a clear voice to these governments that you do not mistreat human rights,” Vietnamese-Australian protestor Davy Nguyen told AFP. Leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations including Hun Sen, Myanmar’s de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi and Vietnam’s Nguyen Xuan Phuc, are in Sydney for talks. The Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte opted not to attend. All have been accused of oppression. “The summit is here, and the [Australian] government needs to do something—they need to put human rights before economics, before money,” Nguyen added. Among banners was one portraying Aung San Suu Kyi with a Adolf Hitler moustache, calling on her to “Return the Nobel Prize.” The terrorist problem has been exacerbated by jihadists now being forced out of Syria and Iraq with the Islamic State caliphate mostly crushed. The issue was driven home last year when pro-Islamic State militants seized the southern Philippine city of Marawi, with Australia aiding Manila to win it back. A memorandum of understanding will be issued at the summit later Saturday, reportedly with an agreement to pool cyber intelligence and police resources across the region for the first time. The Australian newspaper said it would include a regional digital forensics task force and uniform criminal legislative frameworks to secure prosecutions. Australia has suffered six terror attacks in recent years and disrupted 14 more, including a plot to bring down a plane departing Sydney. In response, Canberra has consolidated key functions like national security, immigration, counter-terrorism, cyber-security, and border protection under a newly-created Home Affairs department, headed by Dutton. He said that to address the issue of apps which allow extremists to operate clandestinely, Canberra planned to introduce legislation to strengthen agencies’ ability to adapt to encryption. This will include making companies that provide communications services and devices obliged to assist when asked, while also making the use of surveillance devices and computer network exploitation by authorities easier.

Root causes of extremism must be resolved to win the fight against terrorism	"PUTRAJAYA: The reluctance to recognise the root causes of extremist ideology can be attributed to the slow progress in countering terrorism efforts. Former Institute of Strategic and International Studies (ISIS) chairman and chief executive officer Tan Sri Mohamed Jawhar Hassan said the reluctance had impeded progress to counter the spread of terrorism. ""The root causes are skirted for fear they may become unpleasant to talk about. But unless the root causes are addressed it would be difficult to neutralise in any sustainable manner the threats that the terrorist organisations pose. ""The Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the US bases in Muslim land and corrupt Muslim regimes were the root factors that bred and drove Al-Qaeda. It declared a holy war against the United States, and militants linked to it launched the Sept 11, 2001 attacks. ""IS (Islamic State) was bred in the anarchic conditions that followed the US illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003. It drew much of its recruits and arms from the defeated Iraqi armed forces. ""It has evolved since to draw support and recruits from Muslims in many parts of the world. Outside the conflict zones, the largest number come from European countries in particularly Belgium,"" he said at the Putrajaya International Security Dialogue 2018. Jawhar said the various violent conflicts in West Asia where foreign powers were also involved continued to draw Muslim fighters in the region and from abroad. He shared the findings of the International Centre for the Study of Violent Extremism director Dr Anne Speckhard, who had interviewed nearly 500 terrorists, their families and close associates in nine countries and Western Europe. He said, Speckhard discovered that those resided in conflict zones were most often primarily motivated by trauma and revenge as well as frustrated aspiration. In Europe, Jawhar said, Speckhard's research showed that ""marginalisation"", ""discrimination"", ""unemployment"", ""underemployment"", ""frustrated aspirations"" and ""anger over geopolitics"" were among the significant motivations depending upon the country and the context. The second fundamental factor that had impeded progress in the global counter-terrorism drive was actions that continue to be taken by big powers that further aggravated the environment which bred terrorism and extremism. ""If there is a watershed event that triggered the rise of Muslim militant and terrorist movements it is the expulsion of the Palestinian population from their land following the establishment of Israel in 1948. ""Before 1948, there were hardly any terrorist organisations composed of Muslims. ""Neither did they dominate the terrorism landscape in the manner they do present,"" he said. The recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on Dec 7 had outraged not only Muslims but most of the world, said Jawhar. He added these actions had further fuelled Arab, Iranian and Muslim anger and aggravated the ecosystem in which terrorism and extremism thrived. On counter-terrorism strategy, Jawhar said it had to be enhanced substantially if the scourge of terrorism among Muslims and to the rest of the world was to be neutralised effectively and sustainably. ""The existing hard and soft security measures are of critical importance. ""However, they require to be situated within a more comprehensive and holistic approach that seeks to foster an environment of which terrorism will have no appeal and becomes irrelevant,"" he said. West Asia, he added, had to be transformed from a region of sustained turmoil to a region of sustainable peace."	Terrorism	Terrorism
PH joins global alliance to beat IS – US Secretary of State	"The Philippines has joined a United States-led broad international coalition that seeks to crush terror organization Islamic State (IS), Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson announced on Tuesday in Kuwait. “We were able to announce today it’s now 75 members because we welcomed the Philippines,” Tillerson said in a joint press briefing with the Kuwaiti foreign minister, which transcript was made available at state.gov. The US-led Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS was formed in 2014. Kuwait played host to the meeting of the anti-ISIS coalition and announced a donation of $330 million to help fund Iraq’s reconstruction. “As ISIS has evolved, so has the coalition. The guiding principles that were adopted by the coalition today lay out our vision for the future role of the coalition to continue this fight against ISIS,” Tillerson said. According to Tillerson, the coalition was committed to “destroying ISIS wherever it may be, denying its ability to recruit, move foreign terrorist fighters, transfer funds, and spread their false propaganda across the internet and other social media vehicles.” The Philippine government has yet to announce its participation in the coalition. In May 2017, the ISIS-inspired Maute group besieged Marawi City in the Southern Philippines. This prompted President Rodrigo Duterte to declare martial law across the Mindanao region. The battle between the Maute group and government troops lasted for nearly five months, which resulted in the displacement of thousands of civilians and left Marawi City in ruins. The militants were defeated and failed to establish an ISIS territory or wilayat in Mindanao. During the so-called Marawi City siege, the US extended its support to the Philippines by providing counter-terror weapons to Philippine soldiers. The US also pledged aid in the rehabilitation of the war-torn city."	Terrorism	Terrorism
 China walks a tightrope on the Uighur Muslim issue: Daily Star columnist	"DHAKA (THE DAILY STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - China has never been at ease with its religious minorities-be they Buddhists, Muslims, Christians or those practicing the religio-philosophical traditions of Confucianism and Taoism. China's Communist Party has directed its nearly 90 million members to shun religion for maintaining party unity. It warns that religious belief is a ""redline"" for the cadres and those who refuse to comply would be punished. Religion in China is seen as a hindrance to human development. However, though China's constitution theoretically allows religious belief, China is actually an atheist state and has promoted atheism throughout the country. Consequently, adherents across all religious organisations-whether state-sanctioned or banned/underground-face intensified persecution and repression. The trouble is, over the past decades, religious observance has been on the rise in China. According to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) 2013 Universal Periodic Review, the number of registered religious believers in China is around 100 million, though the actual number will be much higher. Amid rapid modernisation and economic progress, the number of religious believers who yearn to fill their spiritual vacuum has grown. Though persecution against the Uighur Muslims has been going on for some years, the actual picture has now emerged. Uighurs are a Turkic-speaking Muslim ethnic minority numbering nearly 10 million (45 per cent) in a population of 22.1 million in China's largest autonomous province of Xinjiang. They consider themselves culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. Xinjiang is bordered by eight countries including the former Soviet Central Asian republics, Mongolia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. Economic development of the resource-rich region has seen large-scale immigration of the Han Chinese to the region. Han Chinese account for 90 per cent of China's total population but is a minority (37 per cent) in Xinjiang. Uighurs complain of discrimination and marginalisation by the Chinese authorities. There are also complaints that Han Chinese who get the best jobs are not sharing the profits of the region's economic boom. This has led to tensions between the Uighur Muslims and the Han Chinese. Anti-Han resentment has been on the rise since the 1990s and led to serious rioting, knife attacks and suicide bombings on many occasions. Added to this was the surge in nationalist sentiments amongst the Uighur Muslims. If the Central Asian countries can gain independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union, why can't the autonomous Xinjiang be also independent? In early August 2018, the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination reviewed reports of discrimination against Uighurs in Xinjiang. The UN said it is alarmed by reports of mass detention of Uighurs. The UN body released its concluding observations on August 30, 2018, criticising the ""broad definition of terrorism and vague references to extremism and unclear definition of separatism in Chinese legislation."" The Committee report said that Beijing has ""turned the Uighur administrative region into something that resembles a massive internment camp."" More than one million Uighurs are in ""re-education camps""-actually detention camps, according to the Committee. Most inmates have never been charged with a crime but they do not receive any legal representation. Beijing initially denied the existence of such camps but later admitted that some religious extremists were being held for ""re-education"". Beijing says it wants to promote ""harmonious unity"" between Uighurs and the Han Chinese. A large number of Chinese troops are currently stationed in Xinjiang to control the situation. The Committee called upon Beijing to: i) end the practice of detention without lawful charge, trial and conviction; ii) immediately release individuals currently detained under these circumstances; iii) provide the number of people held as well as the grounds for their detention; and iv) conduct an impartial investigation of racial, ethnic and ethno-religious profiling. Clearly, China has been in violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch reports claimed mass imprisonment of Uighur Muslims in camps where inmates are forced to swear loyalty to China's President Xi Jinping and to shout Communist Party slogans. The inmates are poorly fed and reports of torture are widespread with some dying. Some of the oppressive measures imposed include: Uighur children are not allowed in mosques; male Uighurs cannot have beards or wear caps (except for the very old); no veils for women. There are strict restrictions on their movement. In 2014, Beijing also banned Uighurs from fasting during the month of Ramadan. For Beijing, every Uighur is a potential terror suspect. In another development in early August 2018, hundreds of Muslim worshippers in north-western Ningxia region refused to back down when the authorities tried to demolish the Weizhou Grand Mosque on grounds that it was not built with proper permits. Though law enforcers have temporarily left the area, tension continues to run high among the Ningxia Muslims. Beijing's repressive measures on the Uighurs are actually feeding terrorism, according to critics. Suppression of Uighurs has driven many activists underground. Beijing is jittery about the independent way of life, the Turkic language and religious practices of the Uighurs-but more so because of the influence of neighbouring Muslim states. Some Uighurs are said to have fought with ISIL in Syria and have now returned to Xinxiang. Beijing has also recently promulgated a law that prohibits religious preaching on Internet and live-streaming of prayers and worshipping. Beijing justifies its repression on the Muslim population on the lame excuse that China faces serious threats from Islamist militants. But Beijing's policies towards the Buddhists of Tibet and the Christian community are equally questionable. The Chinese Communist Party has not yet been able to reconcile and accept the concepts of human rights and religious freedom. There is a possibility that persecution and repression by the Chinese government on Muslims may lead the younger Uighur generation towards organised resistance and violence.

Strengthen US security through development in PH	"The United States should seize the opportunity to transform its recent military success, assisting the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) in the island of Mindanao, into a durable peace using adaptive measures that focus on key factors for improving human development. Because of the significant geopolitical interests of the United States in this region, it must remain engaged with the government of the Philippines in balancing military and development strategy to bolster the Philippines. The foreign policy of the United States government has previously failed to remedy the fundamental drivers of internal armed struggles in the Philippines, leading to a history of recurring insurgencies. The US State Department, in conjunction with the President and the Security Council, must integrate military success with development initiatives targeting key drivers of armed conflict, to achieve enduring peace. The United States has two critical interests in fortifying its ally, the Philippines. First, the growing influence of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in this region has been enabled by the presence of weaker nations, such as the Philippines. The PRC seized the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, situated between Vietnam and the Philippines, and claimed by both countries. The PRC secured them by building an air base on that territory. The PRC has similar designs for Scarborough Shoals, claimed by the Philippines, and which lie 300 miles from Luzon. However, the PRC does not recognize the tribunal formed to resolve such maritime disputes under the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, placing pressure on all nations who depend on the shipping lanes of the South China Sea through which five trillion dollars’ worth of trade passed in 2016. The South China Sea also harbors seven billion barrels of proven oil reserves and 900 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, enough to reduce dependency of the Philippines on imported oil and domestic coal that provides 45.8 percent of its electricity Second, the domestic security of the United States and its overseas interests depend on defeating State Department-designated foreign terror organizations (FTO) and their allies who pose a transnational threat to the homeland. The impact of terror organizations extends across borders. Abu Sayyaf (ASG) evolved in Mindanao in 1990, partly composed of former Mujahideen fighters returningfrom Afghanistan to the Philippines. Saudi Arabia and Pakistan financed al-Islamic Tabligh, a Filipino charity that educated the founder of ASG in the 1980s. Jeemah Islamiya, an FTO in Malaysia affiliated with al-Qaeda, has given technical support to the insurgent Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) of Mindanao. MILF has claimed a following of over 200,000 in western Mindanao. The Maute Group, a paramilitary gang from the province of Lanao del Sur in Mindanao, swore allegiance to the Islamic State (ISIL) in 2015. The US military has responded by providing technical support to the AFP which defeated both ASG and the Mautes at Marawi in October, 2017, and killed their leaders. The principal drivers of insurgency in the Philippines include injustice, endemic corruption, social marginalization, poverty, and food insecurity. The Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines documented 1,474 extrajudicial disappearances and executions linked to current President Duterte during his tenure as mayor of Davao City. A campaign against illegal street drugs of the current administration has resulted in the documented killing of more than 5,000 prior to arraignment. Current social discrimination against the poorest segments of society has led to further internal conflict. Tensions between communities of the poor and the government have grown. Filipinos perceive that the poor population have become the main targets of President Duterte’s campaign against illegal drugs. According to a Social Weather Stations report dated October, 28, 2017, 54 percent of Filipinos agree that rich drug users are not killed, and only the poor ones are punished in this way. Social and political marginalization not only impacts the poorest Filipinos, but also a group of indigenous people known as the Lumads in the eastern provinces of the island. According to CNN Philippines, in a press conference on July 25, 2017, the Philippine President publicly threatened to bomb Lumad schools, unless the Lumads stop teaching what the President considers socialist philosophy and rebellion. Nationwide economic disparities affect all of the Philippines, not just Mindanao. As a result, the United States must aid the government of the Philippines in implementing large scale development efforts that benefit the poorest Filipinos. Nine percent of the population of the Philippines live as informal settlers or squatters according to the Philippine Statistics Authority in 2015. A survey by Social Weather Stations as of January 16, 2018 found 15.9 percent of families suffer hunger, while 32 percent feel food poor. The World Bank estimates that remittances account for 9 percent of Gross Domestic Product, because Filipinos go abroad to earn a living to support families. The World Bank calculates a current Gini of 45 for the Philippines, evincing wide disparities in wealth. The government of the Philippines initiated a conditional cash transfer program, Pantawid Pamilya Pilipino Program , in 2007 to boost food security among young children. Yet, this initiative needs external support for the government of the Philippines to expand it. The United States must equalize success in security operations with development initiatives to defuse the drivers of insurgency. Governance reform and initiatives to build human capital are especially needed. The State Department could give incentives to the government of the Philippines to cooperate with US aid agencies, USAID and Civil Affairs for the Defense Department, to eliminate the drivers of insurgent armed conflict. The United States should match military success with development initiatives in the Philippines to strengthen US global security. Building the human capital of the Philippines through the coordinated development efforts of both governments will strengthen its core economy and social stability. The governments of the United States and the Philippines must combine military success overcoming armed insurgency in Marawi with a focus on development strategy to alleviate key drivers of insurgency by settling longstanding insurgent grievances in Mindanao. Durable domestic peace in the Philippines will augment US regional security in the Philippines and the South China Sea.

Syria rebels think jihadists will quit Idlib buffer zone	"AMMAN: Syrian rebels said on Thursday they have growing confidence that their jihadist rivals will comply with a requirement to leave a demilitarized buffer zone set up by Turkey and Russia to avert a Russian-backed Syrian army offensive. Last week Turkey and Russia agreed to enforce a new demilitarized zone in Idlib province from which ""radical"" rebels will be required to withdraw by the middle of next month. The position of the biggest jihadist group, Tahrir al-Sham, spearheaded by al Qaeda's former Syrian offshoot, will be crucial to the deal's success, but it has so far said nothing. Several rebel sources said neither jihadist nor mainstream rebels had started to pull back yet. However, a senior Syrian opposition official said Tahrir al-Sham had sent secret feelers to the Turkish army though third parties in recent days signaling it would comply. ""Matters are moving well and Tahrir al-Sham has pledged it is going to implement but without announcing its agreement,"" said the opposition official, who was briefed by Turkish officials and requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. The demilitarized zone will be 15 to 20 km (10 to 12 miles) deep, run along the contact line between rebel and government fighters, and will be patrolled by Turkish and Russian forces. The agreement could unravel quickly if they cannot impose their plan on the jihadists. Another senior opposition figure said he expected Tahrir al-Sham to implement the deal and dismissed risks of a showdown because the agreement did not seek to force jihadist fighters to hand over their weapons. ""I foresee it will be implemented within the time set,"" said Ahmed Toma, a prominent opposition figure who headed the Syrian rebel delegation in Russian-sponsored talks in the Kazakh capital. Turkey sought to avert the Syrian army's Idlib offensive, fearing a new exodus of refugees as the U.N. warned of a humanitarian catastrophe. Ankara pledged to Moscow it would handle the jihadist threat. A regional intelligence source said the jihadists were softening their stance to avoid internecine fighting with mainstream rebels that could wreck the deal and allow the stalled offensive to resume. ""I don't expect any hurdles in implementation from all the revolutionary forces at all,"" said Abdul Salam Abdul Razzak, a leading figure in the National Front for Liberation, the alliance of Turkey-allied Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebel groups. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview with Reuters late on Tuesday that the withdrawal of ""radical groups"" had already started. Another senior rebel source said months of covert Turkish intelligence efforts were focusing on separating a minority of foreign jihadists within Tahrir al-Sham from a majority of its Syrian followers, who could eventually be rehabilitated. Precision strikes would help to handle foreign jihadists, whose presence has often been cited by the Syrian army and Russia as the reason for an assault on Idlib as a ""terrorist nest"", the source said. The National Front for Liberation, which had declared its ""complete cooperation"" with the Turkish effort, said it foresaw a smooth operation once logistical preparations with Turkey were concluded. ""Pulling heavy arms from the frontline is not a difficult matter as most of these weapons are deployed away from the frontline,"" Abdul Razzak said, adding the group's only concern was whether the Syrian army and its allies would abide by the deal."

US blacklists Pinoy ISIS member	"Washington—Three Southeast Asians who appeared in a 2016 Islamic State video showing the beheading of a captive were added to the US Treasury’s sanctions blacklist Friday. The Treasury said Malaysian Mohamad Rafi Udin, Indonesian Mohammed Karim Yusop Faiz and Filipino Mohammad Reza Lahaman Kiram all took part in the June 2016 video made in Syria in which Islamic State members executed a prisoner. Sigal Mandelker, Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said the video was “part of a propaganda campaign to attract radicals to join militant terrorist groups in Southeast Asia.” Udin, 52, is a well-known Malaysian militant, having been detained in 2003-2006 for his association with the radical Islamist group Jemaah Islamiyah. As of last November, he was believed to be the senior most Malaysian in the Islamic State in Syria, the Treasury said.Faiz, 49, was imprisoned in the Philippines for nine years on explosives and weapons charges.  After being released, he traveled to Syria in 2014 and joined Islamic State. Kiram, 28, is believed to be responsible for bombing a bus in Zamboanga, Philippines in 2012.  He was still in Syria fighting for Islamic State as of January 2017, the Treasury said."	Terrorism	Terrorism
How new antiterrorism law will change Indonesia's war on terror	"Indonesia will soon have a new antiterrorism law to replace the current law, which is widely seen as weak, with deliberations on the antiterrorism bill expected to conclude this May or June. Speaking to The Jakarta Post in an interview on Thursday, Enny Nurbaningsih, head of President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo administration's team to deliberate the antiterrorism bill, ensured the new legislation could provide security for Indonesians against deadly terror attacks such as those that had occurred recently in numerous places across Indonesia's most populated island of Java. Calls for the government and the House of Representatives to conclude the long-due deliberation on the bill have mounted after the attacks, which were allegedly conducted by an Islamic State (IS)-linked local jihadist organization known as Jamaah Ansharud Daulah (JAD). Enny, who is also head of the Law and Human Rights Ministry's National Law Development Agency (BPHN), said the government expected deliberations to be concluded at a hearing with the parliament scheduled for May 23, saying that nearly ""99 percent"" of the bill’s content had been finalized, and only the debate over the definition of terrorism as a crime remained to be concluded. Below are some crucial points in the antiterrorism bill, which was initiated after the Jan. 14, 2016 bombings on Jl. MH Thamrin, one of Jakarta's busiest thoroughfares.  What is terrorism? One of the main reasons the deliberations have been dragging on for months is that the government and the House have failed to reach an agreement on what constitutes terrorism. While the government insists that terrorism is ""any deed that uses violence or threats of violence on a massive scale, and/or causes damage to strategic vital objects, the environment, public facilities or international facilities"", the House demands that terrorism as a crime includes ""any deed that is based on political and ideological motives and/or threats to state security."" Lawmakers have said a detailed and rigid definition of terrorism as a crime would ensure that investigators crack down on terrorist activities, while the government believes it would only hamper terrorism prevention and mitigation processes, as it would obligate investigators to determine whether suspects had either political or ideological motives before naming them as terrorists. Enny said the government would accommodate the parliament's request by inserting the latter's version in the general explanation part of the bill, not in the verse section of it. The government expects to convey that proposal to the parliament at the scheduled May 23 hearing, so that the bill can be further deliberated before being proposed for the next plenary meeting. Law enforcers will have greater powers. The new terrorism law will include numerous provisions on terrorism prevention measures -- something that is not dealt with comprehensively in the prevailing terror law, Enny said. ""For instance, we can do nothing to people who plan terror attacks if we use the prevailing law,"" said Enny. Under the bill, plotting terror attacks is a crime. The bill stipulates that a person accused of terrorism could be held in custody from seven to 14 days without charges. Law enforcers could hold them for up to 200 days after officially charging them with terrorism. Rights activists have voiced concerns over the policy, but Enny ensured that the policy would be carried out in accordance with human rights principles. If there is a law enforcement officer found guilty of violating human rights principles during the terrorism investigation process, they will be charged with a criminal offense, said Enny. People who import explosives or components such as chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or radioactive weapons for terrorism purposes into the country, or make, receive or possess them, can be charged under Article 10a of the bill, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment. The bill also charges people who mastermind terror attacks, partake in paramilitary training with the purpose of launching terror attacks or join overseas wars related to terror attacks, with maximum terms ranging from 12 years, 15 years, 20 years to life sentence and the death penalty. That means the police will later be able to charge Indonesians returning from war-torn countries where they are proven to have joined a terrorist group such as IS. Terrorism prevention measures also include what the bill describes as ""counter-radicalization"" and ""deradicalization"" activities. Counter-radicalization activities are intended for people or groups that have been exposed to radical teachings that could potentially lead them to committing terror attacks. Deradicalization activities are intended for terrorist suspects, defendants, convicts, inmates or former inmates and aim to reintegrate these people into society. The bill says counter-radicalization and deradicalization activities will be detailed in other supporting regulations. The roles of the Indonesian Military (TNI) The decades-long rivalry between the two institutions to handle and manage state security has been apparent during the deliberation of the terrorism bill. Activists have also warned about possible abuse of power carried out by the two authorities in handling terrorism. Enny ensured that, while the bill finally included a provision on the role of the TNI in countering terrorism, the military would not be involved in law enforcement. “To prevent the military from entering the domain of law enforcement, we have decided that the President will regulate the TNI’s involvement through a government regulation.” The regulation will refer to the 2004 TNI Law, which stipulates that the TNI’s involvement in civilian affairs depends on the political decision of the state, which should be consulted with the House. Victims of terror attacks have long sought comprehensive provisions about their rights as victims. Yayasan Penyintas Indonesia, an organization that supports terror victims, detailed in 2016 that over 1,900 victims of terror attacks suffered from physical and mental trauma from a number of bomb attacks that had occurred since the start of the millennium. House terrorism bill committee chairman Muhammad Syafi'i said last year that ""the well-being of victims has been one of our biggest concerns since the beginning of the deliberation."" The terrorism bill has one special chapter dedicated to detailing protection for victims of terror attacks. The bill acknowledges two kinds of victims: direct victims, for example victims who are killed or injured in attacks, and indirect victims, for example wives who lose their husbands as a result of a terror attack. The bill says terror victims are the ""responsibility of the state"", a responsibility which is fulfilled by providing medical assistance, psychosocial and psychological rehabilitation, as well as financial compensation for the families of the deceased.

Orphaned children used in terror attacks struggle with severe trauma	"The suicide bombings in Surabaya and Sidoarjo, both in East Java, have left the perpetrators’ children severely traumatized after they were used as part of their parents’ terror plot. Seven-year-old AAP is now undergoing treatment by the East Java Police for severe trauma and physical injuries she sustained when her parents took her and her two siblings to the Surabaya Police headquarters on Monday and detonated a bomb that had been strapped to their bodies. Her parents and siblings were killed in the blast. East Java Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Frans Barung Mangera said on Wednesday that AAP’s injuries were improving, but her mental state would likely take time to recuperate. AAP is reportedly able to speak, but responds to questions with a brief “yes” or “no”. When pressed for longer answers, she lapses into silence. She received on Wednesday several visitors who offered her support, including Seto Mulyadi, chairman of the Indonesian Child Protection Agency (LPAI). AAP’s grandfather and uncle also came to visit her on Wednesday. AAP may choose to live with them, but East Java Police chief Insp. Gen. Machfud Arifin said he himself would carefully determine where and with whom the child would live to ensure she would not be exposed to radical ideologies. “It will be my own authority to approve who can adopt AAP,” Machfud said. During Wednesday visit, her uncle and grandfather refused to acknowledge AAP’s parents as their relatives, said Frans. So far, no one has stepped forward to claim the bombers’ bodies. If they remain unclaimed, the police said they would bury them in accordance with their religious beliefs. In a video footage of moments after the blast occurred, AAP was seen standing up from the ruins of a car affected by the blast. She looked shaken when a police officer quickly came to rescue her. (Antara/Didik Suhartono) In a video taken moments after the blast at Surabaya Police headquarters, AAP’s small figure could be seen rising from the ruins of a motorcycle her family had used. As she swayed unsteadily on her feet, a police officer rushed forward to scoop her up and carry her away from the still smoldering wreckage. According to the police, AAP had been staying at her grandparents’ home when her mother picked her up on Wednesday morning, then drove her to the police headquarters. AAP reportedly survived the blast because she did not have explosives strapped to her body. She is not the only child to have survived and been used as part of a terror attack. FPH, 11, HU, 11, and AR, 15 were orphaned after their father Anton Febriyanto and mother Puspitasari were killed in an explosion at a low-cost apartment in Wonocolo, Sidoarjo, on Sunday night. The bomb, to be used in another attack in Surabaya, accidentally went off as it was being assembled by Anton. One of their siblings was also killed in the incident. FPH and HU are also being treated by the East Java Police. AR was not at the scene at the time of the incident. The police said that AR had not been exposed to radical teachings because he lived with his grandparents. During his visit, Seto said that the children being treated were improving and would likely be allowed to return to their relatives soon. He added that LPAI would monitor the orphans, including by giving them any help they needed. These children, he said, were not terrorists, but victims of their parents’ radicalism."

"Abu Sayyaf hunter, peace advocate named new AFP chief"	"MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday named Lt. Gen. Carlito Galvez of the Western Mindanao Command as the new chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the second significant change the chief executive announced to his security officials today. Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said that the start of Galvez's term of office and that of Director Oscar Albayalde as Philippine National Police chief, the president's other major security appointment, would be on April 14. “The president just said that please announce that it is Lieutenant General Carlito Galvez as the next AFP chief of staff,” Roque said in a press conference in the Palace. Galvez is the chief of the Zamboanga City-based Western Mindanao Command, the area command that covers Marawi City, the scene of intense five-month fighting between government forces and Islamic State-inspired Maute and Abu Sayyaf terrorists last year. He is also an Army Scout Ranger officer and a veteran of operations against the Abu Sayyaf. He is the overall commander of the military’s anti-terrorism campaign against militants in Marawi and the rest of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. Westmincom told Philstar.com that is has yet to issue an official statement on the appointment. Galvez will replace Gen. Rey Leonardo Guerrero as military chief, whose term of office was supposed to end in December but was extended by four more months. Galvez and Guerrero were the top two contenders to replace AFP chief Eduardo Año when he retired last year. The president eventually opted for Guerrero, who was then the military commander in charge of Duterte's hometown of Davao City and was the more senior officer. Under Galvez's command, several top commanders of the Abu Sayyaf group were captured, the most recent of which was militant leader Nhurhassan Jamiri, who was wanted for bombings and kidnappings in several towns and cities in Mindanao. 'Soft-hand approach' Despite his image as an Abu Sayyaf hunter, Galvez also espouses a “soft-hand approach” in dealing with militants. He said that killing a terrorist might result in three or four relatives taking up arms for themselves. “If you will be able to reform one hardcore terrorist, all of his followers and his relatives will be reformed also,” Galvez said, adding that this was the best way to break the chain of violence committed by the Abu Sayyaf group. Galvez, while commander of the 6th Infantry Division, was also instrumental in the peace process with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which signed a peace deal with the government in 2014. The announcement of Galvez as the new military chief capped a day of whirlwind announcements of resignation and appointments. Duterte announced that he had already accepted the resignation of Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II and appointed Menardo Guevarra as his replacement. The president also announced that National Capital Region Police Office Director Albayalde would replace Director General Ronald Dela Rosa as the Philippine National Police head.

"Military to secure Basilan infa projects, workers vs Abu Sayyaf"	"COTABATO CITY, Philippines — The military has assured personnel of the Basilan District Engineering Office of protection from bandits trying to sabotage infrastructure projects in the island province. Last week, two Basilan DEO workers were killed in an ambush in Lamitan City last week by members of the Abu Sayyaf. Two others were seriously wounded in the attack. The Islamic State-inspired Abu Sayyaf has been trying to delay the construction of more roads, schools and agricultural facilities in remote Basilan barangays where its members collect money from residents at gunpoint. Lt. Gen. Carlito Galvez, Jr. of the Western Mindanao Command said Wednesday he has reiterated a standing order for military units in Basilan to secure all Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao projects from sabotage. Basilan is a component province of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. ""They are angry because their camps have become within easy reach of police and military forces as a positive outcome of the implementation in Basilan of road projects by the present ARMM administration,"" Galvez said Wednesday. Galvez said it was for the livelihood opportunities generated by the ARMM infrastructure projects that more than a hundred Abu Sayyaf members in Basilan decided to return to the fold of law in the past 16 months. ""Remnants of this group are trying their best to stop the construction of more roads that would traverse the remaining areas where they can freely roam. We have intensified our security efforts to prevent them from executing their bad plans,"" Galvez said. Galvez said intelligence agents are also helping now protect Basilan’s district engineer, Soler Undug, whose house was bombed by Abu Sayyaf bandits last week. “We are not taking chances. Engineer Undug and his subordinates are in the forefront of all these infrastructure development initiatives in Basilan,” Galvez said. It was the Abu Sayyaf’s fourth attempt to kill Undug using improvised explosive devices in about three years. "	Terrorism	Terrorism
Abu Sayyaf beheads couple in Sumisip	"ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines — Abu Sayyaf militants beheaded a couple they considered ""kafir"" (Arabic for unbeliever or traitor) to their cause in a remote village in Sumisip town, Basilan on Thursday afternoon. A military source who asked not to be named for lack of authority to make public statements confirmed the deaths on Friday. The source said the couple was killed in Sitio Bacahan, Barangay Mahatalang, an area known to have a strong presence of the Abu Sayyaf group. “The couple was killed; the husband was a brother of an Abu Sayyaf member,” the military source said. Senior Superintendent Nixon Muksan, Basilan Provincial Police Office director, identified the victims as a certain Abdurahim Kituh of Sumisip and Nadzwa Bahitla of Isabela City. He said authorities learned of the incident after Cafgu Active Auxiliary member Ibrahim Wahab, who was on duty, heard gunshots in the area. Wahab found in Bahitla's body in the vicinity of Ismael Elementary School at Sitio Diangan, Barangay Mahatalang about 4:30 p.m. Kituh's body was found near the area around three hours later. The remains were recovered and turned over to their relatives in the area, according to Muksan. Police found that the Abu Sayyaf had warned residents before the incident not to pass through the area. The police also believe the group responsible in the beheading is led by Nahim Mustalim, an Abu Sayyaf member and Kituh's half-brother. Mustalim is said to be under the group of Usop Sandalan, a sub-leader of Abu Sayyaf commander Rhadzmil Janatil. Police said the killing may have been part of a rido or clan feud. But the military source disclosed that based on information on the ground, the Abu Sayyaf executed the victims after branding them ""kafir"" and ""infidels"". The military said it was not the first case the Abu Sayyaf group has killed former members who decided to surrender to rejoin mainstream seociety."	Terrorism	Terrorism
11 battalions back in Sulu to go after Abu Sayyaf leaders	"ZAMBOANGA CITY, Philippines — The military has redeployed 11 battalions to Sulu to go after the Abu Sayyaf and its leaders, the military Western Mindanao Command said. Lt. Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr., Western Mindanao Command chief, said troops aim to get ranking terrorist leaders by the end of the first quarter of 2018. Among the targets are senior leaders Radullan Sahiron and Hatib Hajan Sawadjaan, Galvez said. Sahiron, an aging one-armed militant leader, was earlier said to have sent feelers to arrange a surrender but the military found that it was a tactic to slow down operations. Galvez said the operation to crush the Abu Sayyaf was almost completed last year but units had to be deployed to Marawi against the Maute and Abu Sayyaf terrorists that laid siege to the capital of Lanao del Sur from May to October. “We have impending operations there in Sulu and the target is all the high-value targets must be neutralized by the first quarter,” Galvez said. Galvez said addressing the security problem in Sulu is very important to allow government development programs to go on full swing. He said the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao regional government have been supportive of the development campaign and has funded P500 million in infrastructure projects. Local government units and barangay leaders have already committed to leading the campaign to eradicate the Abu Sayyaf group, Galvez said. He said local leaders had helped prompt the surrender of more than 140 Abu Sayyaf members since last year. Westmincom has also recorded 127 militants killed and 90 captured in the same period.

"Soldiers capture 3 Abu Sayyaf men in raid on their lair in Patikul, Sulu"	"Soldiers have captured three suspected members of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) in a raid on their lair in Patikul town of Sulu. Lt. Gen. Arnel dela Vega, commanding general of the Western Mindanao Command, said the ASG men were arrested during the operation in Barangay Maligay in Patikul town over the weekend. He identified them as Gafur Albani Absari, Medzfar Mangabong and Madjid Mangabong. They were turned over to 501st Brigade. The military has been trying to cripple the operation of the ASG in Sulu and Basilan, with the goal of licking the Abu Sayyaf problem before the end of the term of President Duterte. But recently, it was believed to have collected money again with the release of a kidnap victim which was abducted in Zamboanga del Sur in August this year. The ASG was tagged as responsible for the series of high-profile kidnappings in the past, involving both locals and foreigners which they would seize as far as Malaysia. It also gained notoriety for beheading their kidnap victims whose family would fail to pay their ransom demand."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Palace not threatened by Abu Sayyaf regrouping efforts	"Malacañang expressed confidence that the government will be able to overcome the threat of the Abu Sayyaf group (ASG) no matter how many times they try to regroup. Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque made the statement after the Straits Times reported that the terrorist group is looking to get back into the business of kidnap-for-ransom. “The resurrection of a kidnap-for-ransom group in the southern Philippines after a 21-month hiatus is posing fresh threats to Sabah’s east coast,” the report read. Malacañang, however, does not feel threatened by the report, saying the government is ready to overpower the group anew. “Handa po tayo harapin ang banta galing sa Abu Sayyaf. Kinakailangan po silang mag-regroup dahil napulbos na natin sila (We are ready for any threat coming from the ASG. They need to regroup because we already finished them off),” Roque said Thursday. “Asahan niyo po na kahit anong gawin nilang regroupment ang Abu sayyaf po kayang-kayang pulbusin ng ating gobyerno (Expect that the government can defeat them no matter how what kind of regroupment they do),” he added. Roque, meanwhile, welcomed the review of the United States State Department on the country’s campaign against terrorism and violent extremism. “The Country Reports on Terrorism 2017 of the US State Department mentioned the concrete steps that the country undertook to combat terrorism and prevent violent extremism,” Roque said. The report mentioned the continued inter-agency information sharing between Philippine law enforcement agencies; increased aviation security capacity; and active participation in trainings on crisis response, border security, and investigations including cybercrimes. It also noted that the Philippine government has consistently acknowledged the dangers from ISIS-affiliated terrorist groups and welcomed assistance on counterterrorism and reconstruction from Australia, Japan, and the United States."

Government troops still chasing 150 Abu Sayyaf terrorists — Lorenzana	"Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said that government troops are still hunting down close to 150 Abu Sayyaf terrorists in Basilan and Jolo. Lorenzana made the remark after President Rodrigo Duterte reminded soldiers to not allow themselves to fall victims or hostages of terrorists groups and urged them to destroy and kill them. In a speech in at Camp Teodulfo Bautista Headquarters, Brgy. Bus-bus, Jolo, Sulu Saturday night, Duterte said he will support the soldiers in their fight against terrorists. In a separate interview, Lorenzana said as far as he is concerned, there are still an estimated 100 Abu Sayyaf terrorists still hiding in Jolo while in Basilan there are about 35 of them still being pursued by the military. “Kaya nga mahirap hanapin dahil kakaunti na lang sila eh (That’s why its hard to find them because there number has dwindled),” Lorenzana told reporters during the heroes welcome accorded for the returning 700-man contingent on board BRP Davao del Sur (LD602) and BRP Andres Bonifacio (FF17) which participated in the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) 2018, the biggest and most prestigious naval exercise in the world held in Honolulu, Hawaii. The heroes welcome was held Monday at Pier 13, South Harbor, Manila. Lorenzana, in the same interview, said that the Abu Sayyaf suffered a significant drop in the number of their membera brought about by the relentless operatons conducted by troops comprising the Joint Task Force (JTF) Sulu and JTF Basilan. He added that a significant number of Abu Sayyaf terrorists have also surrended since the start of the year. “Oo signficant drop talaga (There was a significant drop). So kung meron naman silang window to surrender, kung magsu-surrender pero if they continue to create, to commit atrocities, (we wil go after them),” he said. Lorenzana said the Abu Sayyaf continues to hold a total of nine hostages in Jolo, Sulu, some of whom have been in captivity for two years already. Aside from the Abu Sayyaf, the military is also after some 100 to 150 members of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedoom Fighters (BIFF) in Central Mindanao. (Francis T. Wakefield)"	Terrorism	Terrorism

ISIS family' kill 13 in Indonesia	"SURABAYA: A family of six including two young daughters staged suicide bombings at three Indonesian churches during Sunday services, killing at least 13 people and wounding dozens in attacks claimed by the Islamic State group. The bombings at three churches in Surabaya were Indonesia's deadliest for years, as the world's biggest Muslim-majority country grapples with home-grown militancy and rising intolerance towards religious minorities. A further three people were killed and two wounded when another bomb exploded at an apartment complex in Surabaya, Indonesia's second largest city, just hours later, police said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. The church bombers -- a mother and father, two daughters aged nine and 12, and two sons aged 16 and 18 -- were linked to local extremist network Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) which supports IS, said national police chief Tito Karnavian. Local media reports say they may have returned from Syria, where hundreds of Indonesians have flocked in recent years to fight alongside IS in its bid to carve out a caliphate ruled by strict Islamic law. The mother, identified as Puji Kuswati, and her two daughters were wearing niqab face veils and had bombs strapped to their waists as they entered the grounds of the Kristen Indonesia Diponegoro Church and blew themselves up, Karnavian said. The father, JAD cell leader Dita Priyanto, drove a bomb-laden car into the Surabaya Centre Pentecostal Church while his sons rode motorcycles into Santa Maria church, where they detonated explosives they were carrying, Karnavian said. ""All were suicide attacks but the types of bombs are different,"" he said of the church attacks. The group, led by jailed radical Aman Abdurrahman, has been linked to several deadly incidents, including a 2016 gun and suicide attack in the capital Jakarta that left four attackers and four civilians dead. That was the first assault claimed by IS in Southeast Asia. Police on Sunday said four suspected JAD members were killed in a shootout during raids linked to a deadly prison riot this week. Five members of Indonesia's elite anti-terrorism squad and a prisoner were killed in clashes that saw Islamist inmates take a guard hostage at a high-security jail on the outskirts of Jakarta. IS claimed responsibility. Karnavian said Sunday's church attacks may have been revenge for the arrest of some of JAD's leaders and for the prison crisis which eventually saw the surrender of the radical inmates. The Pope offered support over ""the severe attack against places of worship"", while President Joko Widodo called for Indonesians to ""unite against terrorism"". ""The state will not tolerate this act of cowardice,"" he told reporters in Surabaya. East Java police spokesman Frans Barung Mangera confirmed the deaths of 13 people in the church bombings, with about 40 injured in the coordinated attacks at around 7:30 am (0030 GMT). Images showed a vehicle engulfed in flames and plumes of thick black smoke as a body lay outside the gate of Santa Maria Catholic church, with motorcycles toppled over amid the mangled debris. In addition to the suicide blast police experts defused two unexploded bombs at the Surabaya Centre Pentecostal Church. Later on Sunday night a bomb killed three people and wounded two, all from the same family, who occupied the fifth floor of a low-cost Surabaya apartment complex, East Java police spokesman Frans Barung Mangera said. ""Three people have died, two are in the hospital and one is safe,"" he texted via Whatsapp. The explosion hit the apartment complex about 9 pm, local media reported, and residents were evacuated from the building after the blast. Yono, tenant coordinator at the apartment block, said the family had lived there since 2015. Concerns about sectarian intolerance in Indonesia have been on the rise, with churches targeted in the past. Nearly 90 percent of Indonesia's 260 million people are Muslim, but there are significant numbers of Christians, Hindus and Buddhists. Police shot and wounded an IS-inspired radical who attacked a church congregation outside Indonesia's cultural capital Yogyakarta with a sword during a Sunday mass in February. Four people were injured. In 2000 bombs disguised as Christmas gifts and delivered to churches and clergymen killed 19 people on Christmas Eve and injured scores more across the country. The archipelago nation of some 17,000 islands has long struggled with Islamic militancy, including the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people -- mostly foreign tourists -- in the country's worst-ever terror attack. Sunday's bombings had the highest death toll since nine people were killed in 2009 attacks on two luxury hotels in Jakarta. Security forces have arrested hundreds of militants during a sustained crackdown in recent years that smashed some networks, and most recent attacks have been low-level and targeted domestic security forces. But the coordinated nature of Sunday's bombings suggested a higher level of planning, analysts said. ""Recent (previous) attacks have been far less 'professional',"" said Sidney Jones, an expert on Southeast Asian terrorism and director of the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict."

 Court postpones hearing for terror leader Aman Abdurrahman	"The court hearing scheduled for Friday morning in the terror trial of the most prominent ideologue in the Islamic State (IS) movement in Indonesia, Aman Abdurrahman, has been postponed for “technical difficulties”. The prosecutors encountered difficulties in transporting the defendant from his cell at the National Police’s Brigade Mobile headquarters (Mako Brimob) detention center in Depok, West Java, two days following a deadly riot that broke out between detainees and the police. “We cannot bring the defendant to the court, therefore we cannot read out the charges today. We request [a hearing] postponement,” prosecutor Anita told the South Jakarta District Court as quoted by kompas.com. The judicial panel granted the request and postponed the hearing until next Friday. Aman, the leader of terrorist group Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), is on trial for several recent bombing attacks in the country in recent years, including the deadly January 2016 bombing on Jl. MH Thamrin in Central Jakarta. Aman’s lawyer Asrudin Hatjani mentioned separately that prosecutors were unable to transport Aman to the court because conditions at the Mako Brimob detention center in Depok were unclear. The riot that broke out on Tuesday evening led to a prison siege that ended on Thursday morning with police forces storming the facility. Five police officers and one inmate were killed during the siege. Asrudin said he had tried to meet his client, but could not because the detention center was still closed to the public. From the information he had gathered from police officers, Aman was “in good condition” and was being held in a separate detention block from other IS-linked inmates. After the riot, the police have moved 145 of the 155 terrorist inmates involved in the rioting – not all 155 as reported earlier – from Mako Brimob to the Nusakambangan maximum security prison island in Cilacap, Central Java. Aman remains in detention at Mako Brimob as a defendant in ongoing court trials. The terrorist inmates, who held a police officer hostage during the nearly 40-hour siege, had demanded to speak with Aman during initial negotiations early on Tuesday, a demand the police later met.

More deaths follow Indonesia prison riots	"JAKARTA: Indonesian police said Friday three more deaths occurred after they declared an end to a riot by Islamist militants at a detention centre near Jakarta, in which five police and one inmate died the day before. Another member of the elite Mobile Brigade police unit was stabbed to death late Thursday, the police said, shortly after a 38-hour standoff at the detention center in Depok was said to have ended with the surrender of rioting Islamic militants being held there. A 22-year-old university student allegedly stabbed and killed a 41-year-old intelligence officer inside the brigade's headquarters building, where the youth had been brought for questioning for acting suspiciously, according to National Police spokesman Setyo Wasisto. The young man died after being shot by another policeman, Setyo said. It was not immediately clear whether the student was a member of a terrorist network. ""We are still investigating his background,"" Setyo told a news conference. In a related incident, one suspected Islamist militant was killed and another wounded by police when a fight broke out while four men were being bought to Jakarta for questioning, according to Setyo. Police arrested the four men in the town of Bekasi in West Java Province early Thursday, after receiving intelligence reports that the four were on their way to the detention center near Jakarta to join the rioting Islamist militant detainees in fighting the police. While being brought to Jakarta for questioning, two of the four men attacked policemen who were escorting them and tried to grab their weapons. The policemen then shot them, killing one and injuring the other, Setyo said. ""Early investigation shows that the four men were members of the Islamic State-linked Jamaah Ansharut Daulah who planned to get involved in the detention center riot,"" he said, adding police had seized various kinds of weapons and ammunition from those men. When militant inmates began rioting at the detention center on Tuesday, radical Muslim groups called via social media for their followers to go to the Mobile Brigade's headquarters to help the inmates fight the police."

"Densus 88 members surround Mako Brimob, negotiate with terror inmates"	"Armed members of the Densus 88 anti-terrorism squad have surrounded the detention center at the National Police’s Brigade Mobile headquarters (Mako Brimob) amid a standoff with Islamic State-linked prisoners who are reportedly holding a police officer hostage following a riot on Tuesday night. The convicts are known to be armed after they killed five police officers and seized their guns during the riot, the police said. The authorities are negotiating with the militants for the hostage's release. National Police spokesman Insp. Gen. Setyo Wasisto said they had not set a deadline in negotiating with the terror convicts. There are about 130 convicts in the cells, housed in blocks A, B and C. “We have not set a deadline. The most important thing is that we reach an agreement, hopefully as soon as possible,” Setyo told reporters on Wednesday afternoon. At least four people have been deployed to negotiate with the convicts, who are allegedly connected to Amman Abdurrahman, a leader of terrorist group Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD). Amman is also being detained at the detention center. Asked why negotiations were taking a long time, Setyo said because some of the convicts’ demands were not acceptable. Setyo refused to say what the demands were, although unconfirmed reports said the militants were asking to meet local IS ideologue Aman Abdurrahman, who is currently on trial on terrorism charges. Setyo said the detention center was overcrowded, adding that they would review the facility after riot. The police claim that the riot was triggered by a “simple issue” of food that a relative of a convict brought from outside the prison for the inmate. "	Terrorism	Terrorism
Jakarta suicide bomb mastermind jailed for nine years	"The convicted mastermind of a deadly twin bombing in Jakarta last year claimed by the Islamic State group was sentenced to nine years in prison on Monday. Kiki Muhamad Iqbal, 38, was found guilty of organising the suicide attacks that killed three policemen and injured a dozen others at a busy bus station in the sprawling capital. Ahmad Sukri and Ikhwan Nur Salam, who died when they blew themselves up in the huge explosions in May 2017, had attended a mosque where Iqbal gave fiery sermons calling on Muslims to ""die as martyrs"", the North Jakarta court heard. ""(The defendant has been) proven, legally and convincingly, of committing the crime of plotting and mobilising others to commit a criminal act of terrorism,"" presiding judge Purwanto said. It was less than the 12-year jail term that prosecutors had demanded. Iqbal, who was arrested two weeks after the bombings, pleaded not guilty and said he had no knowledge that the two men would carry out an attack. He had already served time in jail after being convicted in 2011 of making bombs to be used in terror attacks. Iqbal is believed to be a student of radical cleric Aman Abdurrahman, the leader of the Islamic State (IS)-linked militant outfit Jamaah Ansharut Daulah. Abdurrahman is also currently on trial for masterminding a deadly 2016 attack in downtown Jakarta, claimed by IS, that killed four bystanders. Four militants died after they were shot or blew themselves up in the brazen midday attack. Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim-majority country, has long struggled with Islamist militancy and has been hit by a series of attacks in the past 15 years, including the 2002 Bali bombings that left 202 people dead."

"Trial of 2016 Jakarta terror attack ideologue hears how his sermons, blog radicalised others"	" JAKARTA - A militant who headed a terror organisation founded by influential radical cleric Aman Abdurrahman told a court on Friday (March 9) that he had read a book written by the cleric, looked up to him and considered him a religious teacher. Zainal Anshori, 43, former head of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) was testifying in the trial of Aman, who is facing the death penalty for inciting others to commit various terror acts in Indonesia. JAD is an underground organisation which has been responsible for several terror incidents in Indonesia, including an attack in Jakarta in 2016 that left four bystanders dead and the Samarinda church attack in Kalimantan that killed a toddler in the same year. The book written by Aman entitled ""Seri Materi Tauhid"", which espouses an extremist interpretation of Islam, is a reference book for members of JAD, said Zainal, who admitted that Aman had appointed him as the organisation's head. ""Aman is not in the organisation structure of JAD but he is often consulted. He is above me,"" Zainal said. He claimed Aman never told his followers to launch a terror attack. Aman's book, among other things, denounces democracy as ""syirik"", or idolatry, and argues that Muslims have a duty to free themselves from such a system. The court on Thursday also heard from two other witnesses whom prosecutors grilled to build a stronger case against the radical cleric. Former terrorist bombmaker turned preacher, Kiki Muhammad Iqbal, 38, admitted that he attended sermons given by Aman, and supported his teachings. Kiki also said that Aman never incited others to commit terror acts. Kiki has been accused of delivering a sermon in Bandung on May 19, 2017, that allegedly incited Ahmad Sukri and Ikhwan Nur Salam, the two men who were killed while mounting a suicide attack near a bus station in Jakarta on May 24, 2017. The attack left three police officers dead. The third witness was Dodi Suridi, 23, who helped make the bomb used in the Jan 14, 2016 twin attacks on a police post and a Starbucks outlet in Jakarta that killed four innocent bystanders. Dodi admitted that he had an enormous hatred for the Indonesian government because it had curbed people from leaving the country for Syria to join the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Dodi also told he court he considered ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to be his president. He also disclosed that his hatred against the government grew stronger after reading a blog written by Aman. Dodi had earlier told police investigators that the blog discussed how apostates and those who insulted God had to be killed."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Thamrin bombing mastermind inspired by Paris attack: Prosecutor	"Aman Abdurrahman, the alleged mastermind of suicide bombings and shootings at Jl. MH Thamrin, Central Jakarta, in January 2016, was inspired by the Paris terror attack in November 2015, a prosecutor has said. The statement was written in the indictment read by prosecutor Anita Dewayani in a court hearing in the South Jakarta District Court on Thursday. Anita said a follower named Saiful Munthohir visited Aman in November 2015. At the time, Aman was serving time at Nusa Kambangan Prison in Cilacap, Central Java, for another terrorism case. Aman told Saiful about the plan for the attack on Jl. MH Thamrin, Anita said. ""The suspect whispered [to Saiful] that there was an order from a caliphate leader in Suriah to execute amaliyah [to perform religious practice] jihad, like what had been done in France,"" Anita said as reported by kompas.com. Aman then told Saiful to recruit a field coordinator that would execute the plan, she added. In December, Aman reportedly ordered four people to do the attack on Jl. Sabang, Central Jakarta, an area popular among foreigners. However, the plan changed when the perpetrators instead bombed a Starbucks and a police post in Sarinah, Jl.

 Indonesian IS-linked militant jailed for 7 years	"The Indonesian leader of an Islamic State-linked militant group was jailed for seven years Monday over plans to smuggle weapons from the southern Philippines, a court said. Zainal Anshori, 43, head of Jamaah Ansharut Daulah, was found guilty of committing a ""criminal act of terrorism"" by the Jakarta court. His group is believed to be responsible for several terror plots in Indonesia including a January 2016 attack in Jakarta that left eight people dead, including four militants. The cache of some 50 weapons, which did not reach their destination, were intended to be used in future attacks in Indonesia, the court said. Indonesia, the world's biggest Muslim majority nation, has been on heightened alert following a string of IS-inspired attacks and plots. Many jihadists from Indonesia -- which has long struggled with Islamist militancy -- have in recent years travelled to join IS in Syria and the Philippine city of Marawi. Foreign and local IS supporters ravaged Marawi before being defeated in October, ending a five-month conflict with the military that left about 1,100 people dead. Last week, a Jakarta court sentenced an Islamist militant to ten years in prison for buying a cache of guns from a rebel group in the Philippines."	Terrorism	Terrorism

Alleged terrorist acts as recruiter for militants overseas	"Jakarta (ANTARA News) - A police spokesman, Brigadier General Muhammad Iqbal, said the alleged terrorist Reza Nurjamil (26) acted as a recruiter of Indonesians to fight as terrorists in foreign countries. ""He played his role to send some people from Indonesia to foreign countries,"" Iqbal remarked here on Friday. Currently, Reza is under police investigation in Jakarta. ""He is now in Jakarta, and still under questioning."" The police`s anti-terrorism unit Densus 88 has also tracked down other suspects in the network. Reza was arrested by Densus 88 in Angkasa Street of Nunukan village in North Kalimantan on December 31. Reza is reportedly a member of the Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), and comes from Tasikmalaya, West Java. The JAD was responsible for several deadly terror attacks in Indonesia last year, including a suicide bombing at the Kampung Melayu bus terminal in East Jakarta in May, and an attack on a police station in Dharmasraya, West Sumatra, in November. Reza sent Indonesians to the Philippines via Nunukan. The anti-terrorism unit has seven days from the day of arrest to name Reza as a suspect for his involvement in the terrorist network."

Two militants on motorcycle blow themselves up at Indonesian police HQ: Authorities	" Two militants on a motorcycle blew themselves up at a police headquarters in Indonesia’s second biggest city Surabaya on Monday claiming at least one police casualty, authorities said, just a day after a wave of suicide bombings on churches killed at least 14 and injured dozens. Citing CCTV footage from the scene, East Java Police spokesman Frans Barung Mangera said a man and a woman on the bike stopped at the security checkpoint. “That’s where the explosion happened,” he added. “Two people were riding (on the motorcycle) and a woman was sitting at the back.” Authorities did not immediately say if the police officer at the checkpoint had been killed or injured. The deadly explosion comes just a day after a family of six including two young daughters staged suicide bombings at three churches in Surabaya during Sunday services. At least 14 have died as a result of that attack, which was claimed by the Islamic State group, and the toll could climb with more than 40 injured in hospital. The church bombers — a mother and father, two daughters aged nine and 12, and two sons aged 16 and 18 — were linked to local extremist network Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) which supports IS, police have said. A further three people in one family were killed and two wounded when another bomb exploded at an apartment complex about 30 kilometers from Surabaya, just hours later, police said. The mother and one child died from the explosion while police said they shot dead the father who was carrying a bomb detonator. Two other children were injured in the blast and were taken to the hospital. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the apartment bomb."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Four suicide bombers on motorbikes hit Indonesian police HQ	"SURABAYA, Indonesia: Four militants on two motorcycles blew themselves up at a police headquarters in Indonesia's second city Surabaya on Monday, wounding at least 10 people including officers, authorities said, a day after a deadly wave of suicide bombings hit churches. ""There were five people on two motorbikes. One of them was a little kid,"" national police chief Tito Karnavian said. ""This is one family."" An eight-year-old girl from the family survived the attack and was taken to hospital, while her mother, father and two brothers died in the blast, he said. The authorities said the wounded included six civilians and four police. Ambulances and the bomb squad descended on the chaotic scene with the CCTV images showed the mangled wreckage of a motorbike at the security gate at the headquarters in the heart of the city. There was no immediate claim of responsibility after the latest suicide bombing. ""This is a cowardly act, undignified and inhumane,"" Indonesian President Joko Widodo told reporters in Jakarta. ""There will be no compromise in taking action on the ground to stop terrorism."" The lethal explosion comes just a day after a family of six including two young daughters staged suicide bombings at three churches in Surabaya during Sunday services. At least 14 civilians have died as a result of that attack, which was claimed by the Islamic State group, and the toll could climb with more than 40 injured in hospital. - Multiple bombings - The archipelago nation of some 17,000 islands has long struggled with Islamic militancy, including the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people -- mostly foreign tourists -- in the country's worst-ever terror attack. The latest attack came just a day after a wave of suicide bombings on churches killed at least 14 Sunday's church bombings was Indonesia's deadliest attack in years. The attackers -- a mother and father, two daughters aged nine and 12, and two sons aged 16 and 18 -- were linked to local extremist network Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) which supports IS, police have said. Authorities said they believed some of the family members had recently returned from Syria, where hundreds of Indonesians have flocked in recent years to fight alongside IS in its bid to carve out a caliphate ruled by strict Islamic law. A further three people in another family were killed and two wounded when another bomb exploded at an apartment complex about 30 kilometres (20 miles) from Surabaya, just hours later, police said. The mother and one child died from the explosion while police said they shot dead the father who was carrying a bomb detonator. Two other children were injured in the blast and were taken to hospital. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the apartment bomb. In the church attacks, the mother, identified as Puji Kuswati, and her two daughters were wearing niqab face veils and had bombs strapped to their waists as they entered the grounds of the Kristen Indonesia Diponegoro Church and blew themselves up, police have said. The father, JAD cell leader Dita Priyanto, drove a bomb-laden car into the Surabaya Centre Pentecostal Church while his sons rode motorcycles into Santa Maria church, where they detonated explosives they were carrying, according to authorities. JAD, led by jailed radical Aman Abdurrahman, has been linked to several deadly incidents, including a 2016 gun and suicide attack in the capital Jakarta that left four attackers and four civilians dead. That was the first assault claimed by IS in Southeast Asia. Police on Sunday said four suspected JAD members were killed in a shootout during raids linked to a deadly prison riot this week. Five members of Indonesia's elite anti-terrorism squad and a prisoner were killed in clashes that saw Islamist inmates take a guard hostage at a high-security jail on the outskirts of Jakarta. IS claimed responsibility. Karnavian said Sunday's church attacks may have been revenge for the arrest of some of JAD's leaders and for the prison crisis which eventually saw the surrender of the radical inmates."

Al Qaeda-linked group claims Mali attack that killed two French troops	"NOUAKCHOTT: A Malian militant group with links to al Qaeda has claimed responsibility for an attack that killed two French soldiers in the West African country on Wednesday. The soldiers were killed after their armoured vehicle was hit by an explosive device near Mali's border with Niger and Burkina Faso, an area that has become increasingly dangerous for international forces seeking to quell Islamic insurgencies in the remote Sahel region. In October, militants killed four U.S. troops just over the border in Niger, sparking a debate about America's combat role in the vast and unpoliced scrubland just south of the Sahara. JNIM, which has been responsible for other attacks in Mali and has been linked to the kidnapping of at least six western hostages in recent years, claimed responsibility for Wednesday's attack late on Friday on two Mauritanian websites, through which the group has previously communicated. Islamist militants took over northern Mali in 2012 before French forces pushed them back in 2013. But since then the threat has crept back, and attacks have occurred further and further south, into neighbouring Niger and Burkina Faso, and as far afield as Ivory Coast. In a bid to counter the insurgents, international donors on Friday pledged half a billion dollars towards the G5 Sahel, an international force made up of troops from Mali, Niger, Chad, Burkina Faso and Mauritania."

20-year-old IS supporter who planned attack on Better Beer Festival 2017 to spend 9 years in jail	"KUALA LUMPUR: A 20-year-old Islamic State (IS) supporter was sentenced to a total of 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to four terrorism related charges, including a planned attack on the Better Beer Festival 2017 which had been scheduled for October last year. However, Muhamad Hafizi Mat Jusoh will spend only nine years in prison as High Court judge Datuk Mohd Sofian Abd Razak ordered the sentences to be served concurrently. Before pronouncing the sentence, Sofian advised Hafizi to study while in prison and try to do something which would make the nation proud as he was still young. In the first charge, Hafizi was alleged to have given training via a WhatsApp group, “The Rise of Jundullah”, between 9.07pm and 10.28pm on Sept 23 last year, on how to make an explosive device to a group of people who were ready to conducted a terror attack in Kota Baru. He was charged under Section 130F(a) of the Penal Code which carries a maximum 30 years’ jail and fine upon conviction. ADVERTISING In the second charge, Hafizi was alleged to attended a training session at an empty plot of land in Gong Kulim, Pasir Puteh in Kelantan, between 3.30pm and 4pm on Oct 10 last year, as preparation for the terror attack on the festival. The second charge was under Section 130FB(1)(a) of the Penal Code which carries a maximum jail term of 10 years or fine upon conviction. In the third charge, the youngest of nine siblings was alleged to have owned 57 items linked to IS and two items linked to al-Qaeda in his mobile phone at Restoran K&K, Lot 2689, Jalan Tok Janggut, Kampung Kelubi in Pasir Puteh, Kelantan at 4.30pm, also on Oct 10 last year. For this, he was charged under Section 130JB(1)(a) of the Penal Code which carries a jail term of up to seven years or fine upon conviction. In the fourth charge, Hafizi was alleged to have uploaded 13 videos and five pictures involving IS, al-Qaeda and another terrorist group, Jemaah Ansharut Tauhid, on his Instagram account using the handle “al_akh_fillah” using his mobile phone. This offence, under Section 130JB(1)(b) which also carries the same sentence as the third charge, was alleged to have taken place at the same restaurant, at the same time. Sofian handed down a sentence of nine years’ imprisonment for the first charge, five years for the second charge and three each for the third and fourth charges. He ordered the sentences to be carried out concurrently from the date of Hafizi’s arrest on Oct 10, 2017. In mitigation, Hafizi’s lawyer Ariff Azami pleaded with the court to hand down a light sentence, as his client was young, came from a good background and had a bright future ahead if given a chance. “He had never forgotten his studies and even sat for the Sijil Tinggi Pelajaran Malaysia exam while in the Pengkelan Chepa prison while awaiting trial.” Deputy public prosecutor Muhammad Fadzlan Mohd Noor, however, asked the court to hand down an appropriate sentence as this was a serious matter as the accused had made concrete and detailed plans to launch a terror attack."

"Scores poisoned in Aleppo gas attack, Syria and Russia blame rebels"	"BEIRUT (Reuters) – More than 100 people were wounded in Syria’s Aleppo late on Saturday in a suspected toxic gas attack which the government and its ally, Russia, blamed on insurgents. A health official in Aleppo said victims suffered breathing difficulties, eye inflammation and other symptoms suggesting the use of chlorine gas. Rebel officials denied the allegations Russia’s defense ministry said on Sunday its warplanes bombed militants in the insurgent stronghold of Idlib who it accused of firing poison gas at Aleppo. Major-General Igor Konashenkov said Moscow sent advance warning to Ankara, which backs some rebel factions and helped broker a ceasefire in Idlib. A monitoring group said air strikes hit rebel territory in northwest Syria on Sunday for the first time since Russia and Turkey agreed a buffer zone there in September. In Aleppo city, which the government controls, the shells had spread a strong stench and caused breathing problems, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said. State news agency SANA said on Sunday 107 people were injured, including children, after militants hit three districts with projectiles containing gases that caused choking. It marks the highest such casualty toll in Aleppo since government forces and their allies clawed back the city from rebels nearly two years ago. “We can not know the kinds of gases but we suspected chlorine and treated patients on this basis because of the symptoms,” Zaher Batal, the head of the Aleppo Doctors Syndicate, told Reuters. Hospitals had discharged many people overnight. Batal said this was the first gas attack against civilians in the city since the conflict erupted more than seven years ago. STRETCHERS AND OXYGEN MASKS Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar and his Russian counterpart agreed on Sunday that “recent provocations” were aimed at harming the agreement on Idlib, the ministry said. “There was an exchange of views to the effect that … they could continue and that one needed to be ready for them,” the ministry said in a statement. Nobody has claimed the Aleppo attack so far. “The explosive (shells) contain toxic gases that led to choking among civilians,” the city’s police chief Issam al-Shilli told state media. Pictures and footage on SANA showed medical workers carrying patients on stretchers and helping them with oxygen masks. Syria’s foreign ministry urged the U.N. Security Council to condemn and punish the attack. Abdel-Salam Abdel-Razak, an official from the Nour el-Din al-Zinki insurgent faction, said rebels did not own chemical weapons or have the capacity to produce them. Abu Omar, a Failaq al-Sham spokesman, accused Damascus of trying to create “a malicious charade” as a pretext to attack rebel towns. The UK-based Observatory said government shelling earlier on Saturday had killed two women and seven children in a village in Idlib. The Russian-Turkish deal in September for a demilitarized zone staved off an army offensive against the Idlib region, including nearby parts of Aleppo and Hama provinces. The dominant force among an array of factions holding sway in Idlib is Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist alliance led by fighters formerly linked to al-Qaeda. A past U.N.-OPCW inquiry found the Syrian government used the nerve agent sarin in 2017 and also used chlorine several times. It also blamed Islamic State for using mustard gas. Damascus has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons in the war. No rebel group has been confirmed to have used chemical weapons in the war by the by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)."	Terrorism	Terrorism

Bomb hidden in vegetables kills at least 20 in Pakistan market	"At least 20 people were killed and 50 wounded when a bomb hidden in a carton of vegetables ripped through a crowded marketplace in Pakistan's restive northwestern tribal region Friday, officials said. The attack took place during the regular Friday bazaar in Kalaya, a town in a Shiite-dominated area of Orakzai tribal district, senior local official Khalid Iqbal told AFP. ""According to our initial investigation, it was an improvised explosive device hidden in a carton of vegetables,"" he said. A second official, Ali Jan, confirmed the toll. Orakzai is one of seven restive semi-autonomous tribal regions on the Afghan border, an area that has long been a focal point in the global war on terror and was famously described by Barack Obama as ""the most dangerous place in the world"". Washington has insisted that the mountainous region provides safe havens to militants including the Afghan Taliban and Al Qaeda -- an allegation that Islamabad denies. Pakistan, which joined the US war on terror in 2001, says it has paid the price for the alliance. It has been battling Islamist groups in the tribal belt since 2004, after its army entered the region to search for Al-Qaeda fighters who had fled across the border following the US-led invasion of Afghanistan. Multiple bloody military operations have been carried out in the area, officially known as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and home to around five million ethnic Pashtuns. Security has improved in the region in recent years, though lower-level attacks are still carried out with devastating regularity, often targeting Shiites in the area. But it remains notorious for the availability of cheap guns and smuggled goods, along with narcotics including hashish and opium grown in both the FATA and neighbouring Afghanistan. Residents also complain of undue harassment by security forces, citing disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Earlier this year Pakistan passed legislation which paves the way for the tribal areas to be merged into neighbouring Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, bringing them into the political mainstream. The move will impose the Pakistani judicial system on a region still loosely governed by British colonial-era laws and the tribal system of honour, and which has always existed on the fringes of the state."

Burkina Faso grapples with spreading jihadist peril	"ABIDJAN (Ivory Coast), Aug 18 ? Already burdened with jihadist violence in the north of the country, the fragile Sahel state of Burkina Faso must now confront the reality of an escalating threat in its east. Experts say the spread is the result of a squeeze on the insurgents in neighbouring Mali and Niger ? but to roll the rebels back, one of the world's poorest countries will have to dig deep into its threadbare pockets. Islamist attacks on Burkina Faso began in 2015, starting with cross-border incursions in the north. A toll released in April found that 133 people had died in the north in 80 attacks in three years, many of them state officials. Hundreds of schools and town halls have been closed. The capital Ouagadougou, in the centre of the country, has suffered three attacks in two years, leaving 60 dead. The east of the country is now in the firing line. Last weekend, five gendarmes and a civilian were killed when their convoy was ambushed at Fada N'Gourma, the main town of the Eastern Region. The lead vehicle in the convoy struck a mine, and those behind it came under heavy fire. “The method of attack isn't new ? we have had a number of this kind in the Sahel region. But this is the first in the Eastern Region,” said Abdoul-Karim Sawadogo, a West African security expert. “The Eastern Region has been in the eye of the storm for some time. It was already reputed for attacks by criminals but now it is starting to be targeted for terrorist attacks,” said Paul Koalaga, a consultant in geopolitics and security. On June 17, a policeman was killed in the town of Comin-Yanga in a simultaneous attack on the local police and gendarmerie stations. Ironically, the attacks in the east could be a result of pressure exerted on the jihadists in Mali and Niger by France's Barkhane force and the new G5 Sahel force, which pools troops from five states, said Sawadogo. “These repeat terrorist attacks in the east seem to be the work of Abou Walid al-Saharaoui, a warlord in the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara group,” he said. “He and his men have been routed in northern Mali and Niger, and ever since then, many people have been thinking that they may have retreated to the Eastern Region” in Burkina Faso. “The incidents there are consistent with his type of fighters, who specialise in ambush-style attacks, explosive devices and suicide attacks.” Koalaga said the combatants were mainly “Boko Haram remnants who are falling back from Niger.” Boko Haram is a hardline jihadist group that has caused the deaths of at least 20,000 people since it took up arms in northeast Nigeria in 2009. Its insurgency has spilt into neighbouring countries, including southern Niger, Chad and northern Cameroon. “Eastern Burkina is a sparsely-populated area and there are many forests where you can hole up,” a military specialist said, speaking condition of anonymity. The expert said Burkina Faso's anti-terrorism strategy was “not up to speed.” Its weak point, he said, was in the intelligence services, which were based on the Presidential Security Regiment ? a unit that was dismantled after an attempted coup in 2015 that implicated its former chief, General Gilbert Diendere who also served as the country's spymaster. “There has been a lot of effort, genuine will and reassuring talk by the government, but terrorism has clearly advanced,” said Koalaga. “Burkina has to commit major resources to tackle the problem and to stand on its own feet, and not just rely on the G5 Sahel.” "	Terrorism	Terrorism

The attack comes as Tunisia prepares for what it hopes will be a surge in tourism after a spate of jihadist attacks in 2015 sent visitor numbers plunging. After the ceremony at the national guard base close to the capital, hundreds of people watched as several of the dead were laid to rest. A large procession led by members of the armed forces accompanied the body of guardsman Arbi Guizeni through the Tunis suburb of Douar Hicher. The six national guard members were killed, and three others wounded, when their cars were attacked Sunday morning with an improvised explosive device in the Ain Sultan area of the Jendouba border province. The three wounded guards were transferred to a military hospital in Tunis and their condition was stable yesterday, said guard spokesman Colonel Houssemeddine Jebabli. He said search operations launched Sunday were continuing but no arrests had been made. Okba Ibn Nafaa, a Tunisia-based division of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), late on Sunday claimed responsibility for the attack and said it had killed nine soldiers, according to the SITE Intelligence Group that monitors jihadist activity online. Okba Ibn Nafaa and the Tunisian branch of the Islamic State group, Jund al-Khilafa (Soldiers of the Caliphate), are active in the mountainous border region where the attack took place. Tunisia’s President Beji Caid Essebsi on televisiyesterday evening called for unity, saying “we want solidarity among the people which is not the case.” He also announced there would be a security council meeting on Tuesday to shed light on the attack. Sunday’s assault was the bloodiest in Tunisia since a March 2016 attack on security installations in the town of Ben Guerdane on the Libyan border. That attack killed 13 security forces and seven civilians. Tunisia’s tourism industry is still rebounding from a string of devastating attacks in 2015, including one at the National Bardo museum in Tunis and another targeting a beach resort in Sousse that together killed 59 foreign tourists and a Tunisian guard. In May, Tourism Minister Selma Elloumi Rekik said the industry had made a “real recovery”. Since the 2011 uprising that toppled dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, jihadist attacks in Tunisia have killed dozens of members of the security forces and foreign tourists. The country has been under a state of emergency since November 2015, when an IS-claimed suicide bombing in Tunis killed 12 presidential guards. "	Terrorism	Terrorism
‘First’ woman arrested in Mali for helping jihadists make bombs	" Mali’s intelligence services have arrested a Malian woman who was helping jihadists make explosives by supplying them with fertiliser, a first in the country badly hit by terror attacks, security sources told AFP on Friday. “On Thursday, we arrested a Malian woman in Bamako who was helping jihadists make explosives and mines by providing them sizeable quantities of fertiliser. She knew what the fertilizer was used for,” a Malian security source told AFP. The woman is from Mopti, in central Mali, where jihadists have struck repeatedly in recent months — often with homemade explosive devices. Investigators did not reveal the quantity of fertilizer delivered to the jihadists. They are now looking for “other accomplices,” according to the same source, who said the arrest was a first in Mali. “We still do not know the quantity of fertilizer that was provided. But imagine all the landmine and explosives victims!” another security source said, adding the woman was working closely with the Macina Liberation Front (FLM). The FLM is a jihadist group formed in 2015 and headed by a radical Malian preacher, Amadou Koufa, who hails from the Fulani community. Koufa pledged allegiance to the Al-Qaeda-linked Support Group for Islam and Muslims, the main jihadist alliance in the Sahel. The 34-year-old woman, who was arrested and detained in Bamako, looked wide-eyed and scared in a picture obtained by AFP. Landmines and explosives have killed scores in northern Mali, which fell into the hands of Al-Qaeda-linked jihadist groups in 2012. The extremists were largely driven out in a French-led military operation launched in January 2013. But large stretches of the country remain out of the control of the foreign and Malian forces, which are frequent targets of attacks, despite a peace accord signed with Tuareg leaders in mid-2015 aimed at isolating the jihadists. The violence has also spilled over into both Burkina Faso and Niger."	Terrorism	Terrorism
11 killed in Somalia market explosion: Security official	"MOGADISHU (AFP) - At least 11 people were killed in an explosion in a busy market in a small Somali city north of Mogadishu, a security official and witnesses said. ""Eleven people were confirmed dead and more than 10 others were wounded in the blast which we are still investigating, some of the victims have serious wounds and they are admitted at hospital,"" Mohamed Abdikarim, a regional security official, told AFP. Sources contacted by AFP did not yet know whether the blast was caused by a suicide bomber or an explosive device. The blast occurred at the marketplace in Wanlaweyn district about 70km north of the Somali capital where Khat (narcotic leaves) is sold. ""There was chaos at the market, a number of people died and others wounded, I saw the severed dead bodies of civilians but there were also security personnel involved in the casualty,"" Mohamed Dahir, a witness said. Wanlaweyn district is close to the Balidogle airbase where the US special forces have a major base. No group has so far claimed responsibility for the blast. The Shabaab, linked to Al-Qaeda, are known to be present in the region."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"KL says former Al-Qaeda man, 4 other terror suspects held"	"KUALA LUMPUR — Malaysia arrested five terror suspects last month (October), including a former Al-Qaeda operative who had dealings with the Afghanistan-based terror group’s slain leader, Osama bin Laden. National police chief Mohamad Fuzi Harun said the five held comprised two Malaysians, a Pakistani, an Egyptian and a Middle Eastern man. They were detained in Selangor, Perak, Kuala Lumpur and Sabah by counter-terrorism officers during the operation from Oct 13 to Oct 26. The two Malaysians – a man and a woman – had allegedly channelled funds to their compatriot, Muhammad Wanndy Mohamed Jedi, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) recruiter killed in a drone strike in Raqqa last year. The 32-year-old woman arrested in Kuala Lumpur on Oct 25 had allegedly moved money to Wanndy between 2014 and 2017. The 40-year-old service manager from Sabah was held on Oct 26, also for allegedly channelling funds to Wanndy and the latter’s would-be successor, Muhamad Fudhail Omar, who was also killed in Syria last year. He is also alleged to have helped fund the Filipino militant group Abu Sayyaf since 2015. Abu Sayyaf is notorious for demanding ransom after abducting people off the coast of Sabah, which faces the southern Philippines. Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi said the Egyptian suspect had worked in Kuala Lumpur. “The first suspect is a 50-year-old Egyptian working as an executive manager in a Kuala Lumpur firm, and was detained in Selangor on Oct 13. “The suspect was an Al-Qaeda member while in Afghanistan from 1988 to 1993. He had met Osama bin Laden,” he added. The Egyptian had used fake travel documents to enter Canada and Azerbaijan, as well as Pakistan, and has been previously arrested in Canada and Egypt for the same offense. According to Inspector-General Mohamad Fuzi, the other two foreigners were apprehended on Oct 20 and Oct 25, respectively. The 31-year-old Middle Easterner was intercepted at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. “He had issued a death threat against a foreign diplomat in Kuala Lumpur and is suspected (of) involvement in terrorism,” the police chief said. The Pakistani, a 31-year-old laborer, was taken into custody in the town of Sitiawan, Perak, after police discovered his involvement in Lashkar-e-Taiba, one of the largest and most active Islamist terror groups in South Asia, mainly operating in Pakistan. The trained militant has been in Malaysia since 2016. Malaysia has arrested more than 420 terror suspects since 2013, and foiled plots aimed largely at launching attacks locally. The country’s first and only terrorist attack took place in June 2016, when two men on a motorcycle lobbed a grenade into a nightclub in Selangor, injuring eight people. The men were sentenced to 25 years’ jail."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Al Shabaab attacks African Union base in Somalia, says military"	"MOGADISHU, April 1 — Islamist insurgents battled for hours on Sunday with African Union troops after exploding a car bomb outside their base, Somali police, military and the militants said. Al Shabaab militants attacked the African Union (AU) peacekeepers’ base in the town Bulamarer, 130 kilometres to the northwest of the capital Mogadishu, around 9 a.m. local time, residents from the area told Reuters. Since withdrawing from Mogadishu in 2011, the al Qaeda-linked group has lost control of most of Somalia’s cities and towns. But it still retains a strong presence in regions outside the capital. The militants initially detonated two suicide car bombs that hit one AU vehicle and one Somali military vehicle, Somali army major Farah Osman, who is stationed near the AMISOM (African Union Mission in Somalia) base, said. “Then a large number of al Shabaab fighters began firing from under the trees ... it was a hellish battle,” he said, adding there was an unknown number of casualties. The phone of the spokesman for the AMISOM force based in Mogadishu was switched off on Sunday and Reuters was unable to reach any other officials from the force for comment. Abdiasis Abu Musab, a spokesman for al Shabaab said 14 of the group’s fighters and 59 AMISOM troops were killed in the incident. A police major stationed in a nearby town also said two car bombs exploded outside the base before the al Shabaab fighters entered it. Major Nur Ali told Reuters that Somali and AMISOM forces had attacked al Shabaab in rural areas near the base on Saturday night. “Then al Shabaab attacked this morning as a revenge,” he said. Somalia has been mired in civil war since 1991."	Terrorism	Terrorism

"Gunmen kidnap Italian volunteer, shoot children near Kenya's coast"	"NAIROBI, Nov 21 — Gunmen kidnapped an Italian volunteer and shot and wounded a woman and four children in Kenya late on Tuesday, police and witnesses said - the first abduction of a foreigner there since raids blamed on Somali Islamist militants six years ago. Men armed with AK-47 rifles seized the 23-year-old woman from a guesthouse in Chakama, a small town close to the southeast coast, officers and local residents said. Police said they had not identified the attackers and no group immediately claimed responsibility. The Italian charity the woman was working for, Africa Milele, posted a short message on its website saying: “There are no words to comment on what is happening. Silvia, we are all with you.” The group says it helps orphaned children Two witnesses told Reuters they heard the gunmen speaking Somali. “There were three attackers and they targeted the Italian lady,” said Chad Joshua Kazungu. The woman was seized after she came out of her room to find out what was going on, a third unnamed witness told Kenyan TV channel KTN News. “Their aim was to get money but they took off with her to the river,” he said. The attackers opened fire as they left, wounding a woman and four children, he added. A 10-year-old child was shot in the eye and a 12-year-old was hit in the thigh, police said. Today a police helicopter circled over the green and yellow guesthouse where the volunteer had stayed. Chakama in Kenya’s Kilifi region is 60 km inland from the bustling coastal tourist resort of Malindi. A series of abductions further north in 2011 and 2012 - and other attacks by al Qaeda-linked Al Shabaab militants from neighbouring Somalia - caused a slump in tourism numbers and revenue. But local tour operators said they thought yesterday’s attack would only have a limited impact on the vital tourism industry. “The European market might have a small shake-up, but Malindi is 500 km from Nairobi so I don’t expect the safari industry to be affected,” said Robert Katithi, sales director from Go Kenya Tours and Safaris. Gunmen grabbed a wheelchair-bound French woman from her home on the northern island of Manda in 2011 weeks after pirates killed a British man and kidnapped his wife from another resort island. The French woman died while she was still be held, while the English woman was released after a ransom was paid. At the time, the Kenyan government blamed al Shabaab - which has launched attacks inside Kenya in retaliation for Nairobi’s military interventions in Somalia. The militants denied responsibility. Armed men kidnapped four aid workers and killed a driver at Kenya’s Dadaab refugee camp near the border with Somalia in 2012. The Italian foreign ministry said today it was aware of the reports of the abduction and was looking into the situation. "	Terrorism	Terrorism
Death toll from Mogadishu bombings jumps to over 40	"MOGADISHU (AFP) - The death toll from a series of car bombings near a popular hotel in the Somali capital Mogadishu has jumped to at least 41, police said on Saturday (Nov 10). Friday's attack was the latest in a wave of bombings by Al-Shabaab, an Al-Qaeda affiliate which has been fighting to overthrow the internationally-backed Somali government for over a decade. Twin car bombs exploded within moments of each other, followed by gunfire and a third blast, sending thick plumes of black smoke into the sky. Police official Ibrahim Mohamed said that information received from various hospitals indicated that the number of dead had reached 41, with another 106 wounded. ""Most of these people were civilians and nearly 20 of them died in minibuses that were passing by the road when the blast occurred,"" he added. Another security official, Abdirahman Osman, told AFP that nearly 50 had been confirmed dead so far, although the final number was not yet known. Officials on Friday had put the death toll at about 20."	Terrorism	Terrorism
"Malaysia arrests 5 terror suspects, including man who threatened to kill foreign diplomat"	" KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's counter-terrorism police have arrested five terror suspects, including a Middle Eastern man who threatened to kill a foreign diplomat in Kuala Lumpur. The suspects, comprising two Malaysians, one Egyptian, one Pakistani and one Middle Eastern man, were arrested in an operation between Oct 13 and Oct 26, said Inspector-General of Police Mohd Fuzi Harun in a press statement on Wednesday (Oct 31). “The (Middle Eastern) suspect, aged 31, is unemployed and is involved in a case of threatening to kill a foreign diplomat in Kuala Lumpur,” said Fuzi, adding that the suspect was arrested at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The Egyptian national, who works in a private firm as an executive manager, was arrested in Selangor. The 50-year-old was a former member of Al-Qaeda during his time in Afghanistan from 1988 to 1993, and had met Osama bin Laden. “The suspect admitted to using fake travel documents to enter Canada, Azerbaijan and Pakistan,” said Fuzi. “The suspect has been arrested and jailed before in Canada and Egypt for his involvement in terror activities and use of fake travel documents,” he added. A senior intelligence source told Channel NewsAsia that the arrest and discovery of an Al-Qaeda member in Malaysia raise concerns about a resurgence of the militant group.  “We are investigating what are his activities in Malaysia. You must remember, Al-Qaeda is always planning for the long term,” said the source. “Al-Qaeda came to KL in 1999 to plan the 9/11 attack that was later carried out in 2001,” warned the source. The Pakistani arrested in Sitiawan, Perak is a 31-year-old labourer believed to be involved with the Lashkar-e-Taiba terror group. “The suspect has undergone para-military training at Lashkar-e-Taiba’s camp,” said Fuzi, adding that the suspect entered Malaysia in August 2016. The two Malaysians arrested were suspected of giving money to Malaysian Islamic State (IS) member Muhammad Wanndy Mohamed Jedi, who was killed in Syria in 2017. One of the suspects is a woman working in a private firm who was arrested in Gombak, Selangor. The other suspect is a 40-year-old man who was arrested in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah, where he worked as a service manager in a telecommunications company. The suspect channelled money to Muhammad Wanndy and another Malaysian, Muhamad Fudhail Omar, who was also in Syria. “The suspect also donated money to the Abu Sayyaf Group in southern Philippines between 2015 and 2018 with the aim of funding terror activities,” said Fuzi."

Eight arrested in Malaysia over suspected terror links	"Malaysian police have arrested eight men for suspected terror links and extremist activities that threaten national security. The suspects - seven foreigners and a Malaysian - were detained by the Bukit Aman Special Branch Counter Terrorism Division in Kuala Lumpur, Perlis and Johor on Sept 24, national police chief Mohamad Fuzi Harun said in a statement yesterday. Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi said the suspects were involved with an Islamic learning centre in Perlis believed to be promoting extremist teachings. ""The arrests were made following intelligence obtained by police that a terrorist group based on the ideology of Salafi Jihadism in Yemen was planning to set up an Islamic learning centre in South-east Asia to spread the teachings of Salafi Jihadism,"" he added. Early investigations by police and shared intelligence from foreign agencies revealed that the centre's foreign teachers and students are linked to a madrasah in Dammaj, Yemen, founded by Syeikh Muqbil bin Hadi Al Wadi'i, a Salafi Jihadism leader and an extremist. The madrasah follows Salafi Jihadism teachings that allow the killing of non-Muslims and Muslims who do not prescribe to their philosophy. They also label the democratic system as un-Islamic. It was learnt from the arrested suspects that they believe in extremist teachings, such as banning men and women from wearing trousers. Work is also not allowed as this results in men and women being together, and Muslims who do so are labelled apostates. The first arrests in Perlis involved five Europeans and a sixth suspect from the American continent, all aged between 24 and 38 years old and students at the Perlis centre. One of those arrested was related to a citizen of a neighbouring country linked to the Syeikh Muqbil madrasah and who has also undergone weapons training. Intelligence from a foreign agency revealed that all six are linked to the Daesh terrorist group, also known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), or other extremist organisations. The seventh arrest, which occurred in Kuala Lumpur, involved a 33-year-old suspect from the Middle East who was a teacher at the Perlis centre. The suspect was conducting classes to spread Salafi Jihadism teachings in Klang Valley. Police in Johor arrested a 32-year-old Malaysian who was a student at the Perlis centre in 2014. ""The arrests... are to curb the spread of Salafi Jihadism ideology, which is the basis for violent acts by groups such as the Islamic State, Al-Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiah (JI), Abu Sayyaf, Boko Haram and others,"" said Mr Mohamad Fuzi. ""This is not the first time that foreign Salafi Jihadism elements are using Malaysia as a base to spread their ideology and recruit new members."" He added that JI leaders Abdullah Sungkar and Abu Bakar Bashir infiltrated Malaysia in 1985 for the same purpose. Malaysia has arrested around 400 people since 2013 for suspected links to terrorism. In 2016, police arrested 115 individuals in the country with links to terrorist groups. There were 82 arrests in 2015, 59 in 2014 and four in 2013."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Sweden killer claims truck rampage for IS ‘caliphate’	"STOCKHOLM, Feb 21 — An Uzbek asylum seeker who mowed down shoppers in a truck claimed at his trial Tuesday that he killed them in the service of the Islamic State group — but his accusers insisted he acted alone. Rakhmat Akilov, 40, is on trial on terrorism charges for the rampage on a busy shopping street in Stockholm, in which he killed five people and injured 10 more in April last year. He has admitted carrying out the attack and claims to have had the blessing of the Islamic State (IS) extremist group, but prosecutors do not believe that he had direct help. The method of the attack resembled other vehicle assaults in Europe in 2016, including Nice in France and Berlin — but unlike those attacks, the Stockholm killings were never claimed by IS. IS proclaimed an Islamic “caliphate” in parts of Syria and Iraq but has been largely crushed by US-backed coalition forces over recent months. Akilov pledged allegiance to the group and told the court that he had been given the green light by IS members on encrypted chat sites. He claims he was unable to identify them. Investigations have failed to conclude whether he received any financial or material assistance. Chief prosecutor Hans Ihrman said Akilov “sought support” from outside contacts but they did not have a “decisive” role in the attack. “Akilov had planned and prepared the attack on his own” and “wasn’t dependent on other people,” Ihrman told reporters after the hearing. Akilov told the court he wanted “Sweden to end its participation in the fight against the caliphate, to stop sending its soldiers to war zones.” Sweden has around 70 military personnel based mainly in northern Iraq to provide training as part of the US-led coalition against IS. In the attack, Akilov stole a beer truck and crashed it into a store. Three Swedes were killed including an 11-year-old girl, as well as a British man of 41 and a Belgian woman of 31. Ten other people were injured. Akilov then set off an explosive device but it did not blow up as planned and caused damage only to the truck. Akilov fled the scene, running into a nearby metro station, and was arrested several hours later after being identified from security cameras. He told police he wanted “to die as a martyr in an explosion”. Speaking calmly in Russian through an interpreter, Akilov expressed no remorse for his actions. Cooperative at the beginning of questioning, he gradually grew impatient. “From his testimony so far, it’s quite obvious that we are dealing with a person who is quite convinced of the splendour of his deed,” a lawyer for 13 of the plaintiffs, Gustaf Linderholm, told AFP. After arriving in Sweden in 2014, at the start of a wave of migration to Europe, Akilov’s application for residency was rejected in June 2016. He later went on the run to avoid expulsion and worked odd jobs in construction. The father of four drank alcohol and used drugs, according to colleagues and acquaintances. He lived alone in Sweden while his wife and children stayed behind in Uzbekistan. Prosecutors have said they will seek a life sentence and afterwards his expulsion. A life sentence in Sweden varies, but is on average 16 years. The trial is scheduled to last through May, with a verdict due in June. "	Terrorism	Terrorism
More bombs fall on Syria’s Ghouta after heaviest toll in years	"BEIRUT, Feb 20 — Pro-government forces bombarded Syria’s eastern Ghouta today, killing at least 49 people, after the heaviest one-day death toll there in three years on Monday, a war monitoring group said. Some 127 people were killed in air raids, rocket strikes and shelling of the area near Damascus yesterday, according to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. About 190 have died since the bombing intensified late on Sunday and 850 have been injured, it said. The United Nations called for an immediate ceasefire in the area on Monday, saying the situation was “spiralling out of control” after an “extreme escalation in hostilities”. The Union of Medical Care and Relief Organisations, a coalition of international agencies that funds hospitals in Syria, said bombs had hit five hospitals in eastern Ghouta on Monday. In Geneva, the UN children’s fund issued a blank “statement” to express its outrage at the casualties among Syrian children, saying it had run out of words. The violence in eastern Ghouta is part of a wider escalation in fighting on several fronts in Syria as President Bashar al-Assad pushes to end the seven-year rebellion against him. Mortars fired by rebels in eastern Ghouta landed in Damascus today, causing two deaths and several injuries, Syrian state media reported. At least one person died from rebel mortar fire in the capital yesterday. Lebanon’s al-Manar television, which is aligned with Assad’s ally Hezbollah, reported yesterday that the Syrian army was sending reinforcements towards eastern Ghouta after rebel assaults. Assad’s most powerful supporter, Russia, has been following a diplomatic track at the same time as the increase in fighting, resulting in the establishment of several “de-escalation zones”. Eastern Ghouta is in one of these areas, where violence is meant to be contained, but the de-escalation agreement does not include a former al Qaeda affiliate which has a small presence there. Other insurgent groups in eastern Ghouta, including Islamist factions, say the Syrian government and Russia are using the jihadist presence as a pretext to continue their bombardment. Neither the Syrian military nor Russia commented on the renewed bombardment in eastern Ghouta, but they have often said they do not target civilians. The Observatory said the intensified bombing was in preparation for a pro-government ground offensive against the enclave and that a rebel group there had foiled an attempt by Syria’s army to advance overnight."

Report: Foreign terrorists acquiring Malaysian IDs for as little as RM350	" KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 17 ? Foreign terrorists are among those who are acquiring Malaysian identification documents for just RM350, which in turn is enabling them to find jobs in the country, according to a report. New Straits Times said that some of these individuals, who are from the Philippines, have gone on to secure jobs as security guards in the country. It said that counterterrorism operatives had arrested at least two individuals from the Phillippines who had assumed fake identities and even gained employment as a result. They bought their IDs, a fake MyKad, for RM1,000 and RM350 respectively. “The availability of fake Malaysian identification documents is worrying, especially when we don’t know who bought them and where they are,” the report quoted an enforcement agency official as saying. Southeast Asia regional director for International Association for Counterterrorism and Security Professionals, Andrin Raj, said that Malaysia has become a centre for fake documentation in Southeast Asia. “Terrorist groups, such as al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiah, in the past had established Malaysia as the ‘centre’ for securing fake documentation in Southeast Asia,” he reportedly said."

 New York bomber sentenced to life in prison	" US restaurant worker inspired by Osama bin Laden was sentenced to life in prison Tuesday for wounding 31 people in a 2016 New York bombing, branded ""extremely dangerous"" by a federal judge. Afghan-born Ahmad Khan Rahimi, 30, told the court that he became radicalized after being ""harassed"" by the FBI and ""singled out"" for his religion, but showed no remorse for inflicting the bloody injuries. Prosecutors told his two-week trial last year it was a ""miracle"" that nobody was killed in the September 17, 2016 attack. A second bomb forced the cancellation of a US Marine Corps run in the New Jersey town of Seaside Park. He was convicted on all eight counts. Police also defused another device in Chelsea and found additional pipe bombs in Rahimi's hometown of Elizabeth, New Jersey, where he worked in his family's fried chicken restaurant. Rahimi was critically wounded in a shootout with police on September 19 before being captured, and was found with a handwritten journal lauding Osama bin Laden and US-born Al-Qaeda recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki. He moved to the United States in 1995 with his family and became a naturalized citizen in 2011. Addressing the court at length, Rahimi said he understood why there were frustrations between Muslim countries and Americans. ""I have been here for more than 20 years, I had American friends and Muslim friends,"" he said. Things started to change, he said, after he started acting and dressing like a devout Muslim. ""I was harassed by the FBI,"" he said, referring to going on holiday to the Dominican Republic. He claimed he was ""singled out just because of my attire"" after returning from a trip to Pakistan. ""I was never discriminated for my religion until I started following it,"" he said. Rahimi's father contacted the FBI in the months leading up to the attack, warning them about his son's militant sympathies. ""I did not hear an ounce of justification,"" US District Judge Richard Berman. ""There is no comparison between the grievances that you may feel and the actions you took... The conclusion is inescapable that you remain extremely dangerous,"" the judge added. ""Innocent people on a Saturday night, it is inexplicable that anybody would do that deliberately. But you did. It was you."" Since Rahimi's arrest, two other lone-wolf attackers have carried out bombings in New York. A Bangladeshi driver detonated a bomb in a subway passageway, wounding himself and three other people in December. On October 31, an Uzbek immigrant, also reportedly inspired by the Islamic State extremist group, killed eight people on a bike path by ramming his truck into cyclists. New York retains stringent security, which was drastically stepped up after the September 11, 2001 Al-Qaeda hijackings brought down the Twin Towers."	Terrorism	Terrorism
 Report: Terrorist from Philippines bought MyKad for RM350	"KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 12 — The availability of forged Malaysian identification papers have raised concerns that high risk elements like terrorists could leverage on them to infiltrate the country and remained undetected, New Straits Times (NST) reported today. Suspected Islamic State terrorists from the Philippines were reported to have easily secured falsified MyKads for prices ranging from RM1,000 to as low as RM350. This had made it easier for them to register for mobile telecommunications services and get jobs. “One, who police identified as Dahwan, 22, was employed in Cheras. He bought the illicitly reproduced MyKad in Sabah for RM1,000 suspects holding such documents also face no problems registering for mobile phone numbers with local telecommunications companies,” the report said. Another Filipino identified as Nurhan Sahi Hakim, 33, also gained employment in the country by assuming the identity of one “Yusof Attang”. He had been was arrested by counterterrorism operatives. “Nurhan, who had been charged over the alleged offence, admitted that he bought the fake MyKad for only RM350,” the report said. Southeast Asia regional director for the International Association for Counterterrorism and Security Professionals, Andrin Raj, in response to the information said the existence of foreigners with fake Malaysian identification documents posed serious threats to national security, a concern NST reported were echoed by counterterror operatives here. “Terrorist groups, such as al-Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiah, in the past had established Malaysia as the ‘centre’ for securing fake documentation in Southeast Asia,” said Andrin. NST also quoted an unnamed source in an enforcement agency as saying that several foreign terrorist fighters had penetrated the nation’s borders under the guise of someone else. “The availability of fake Malaysian identification documents is worrying, especially when we don’t know who bought them and where they are. “The worry is these people could make their way to sensitive areas,” the source said. Corruption is likely a major factor allowing for identification documents forgery, that means investigation into the matter must go beyond arresting terrorists and target all links to transnational criminal group and corrupt public agencies. “About 15 years ago, when I was working for the Finland embassy, an African came to apply for a visa..I was asked to verify his visa approval from Malaysia. We found a fake approval stamp on his passport,” Adrin said. “There was also a case where an Afghan man entered Malaysia using a fake Spanish passport. He walked through the Immigration passport control with ease. “He bought the passport for US$10,000 (RM39,399) and even knew which passport control line to walk through in Pakistan and Malaysia.”"	Terrorism	Terrorism
Kidnapped mayor of northern Mali town freed	"BAMAKO, Feb 12 — A mayor in northern Mali known for serving as a mediator for Western hostages said yesterday he has been freed after being held captive for around three weeks. “All I can say for now is that I am free,” Tarkint mayor Baba Ould Cheikh told AFP by telephone. A relative confirmed the release, telling AFP he had seen Cheikh earlier in the day, adding that his abduction by six gunmen sometime between January 21 and 23 had been due to “a private matter”. A security source said at the time that the abduction was carried out either “by people he had a disagreement with, or Islamists”. Mali’s government signed a peace agreement with coalitions of non-jihadist armed groups in the north in June 2015. But Islamist insurgents remain active, and large tracts of the former French colony are lawless. The mayor had been named in an enquiry into a drug-smuggling operation in 2009 involving a Boeing 727 flown from Venezuela and burnt after unloading the cargo in the northern Gao region, according to the UN drugs agency. He was arrested for cocaine trafficking in April 2013 but released months later due to lack of evidence. Islamist extremists linked to Al-Qaeda took control of Mali’s desert north in early 2012, but were largely driven out in an ongoing French-led military operation launched in January 2013.

"Syria raids kill nearly 30, as war of words escalates over chlorine use"	"Syria raids kill nearly 30, as war of words escalates over chlorine use Regime bombardment killed nearly 30 people in a rebel enclave near Damascus on Monday, as Syria’s seven-year conflict left civilians paying a heavy price. Residents across several Syrian battlefronts have reported escalating bombardment and have accused Syrian troops of deploying toxic chemicals against rebel-held zones. In nearby Zamalka, another devastated Eastern Ghouta town, a man could be seen carrying the body of his child, wrapped in a blood-soaked white sheet, through the streets. (AFP/ Amer ALMOHIBANY/ Manila Bulletin) The United States on Monday said there was “obvious evidence” of multiple chlorine gas attacks in recent weeks, including in the opposition-held enclave of Eastern Ghouta near Damascus. On Monday, dozens of air strikes and artillery fire battered Eastern Ghouta, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. “Twenty-nine civilians were killed and dozens were wounded,” said the war monitor’s head, Rami Abdel Rahman. The deadliest raids on Monday hit a market in the town of Beit Sawa, killing 10 civilians including two children. Another nine civilians, two of them children and one a local rescue worker, were killed in Arbin. Eastern Ghouta is included in a de-escalation deal agreed last year by rebel ally Turkey and government supporters Iran and Russia. But violence has ramped up there in recent weeks, and this month alone, chlorine is suspected of having been used on two occasions in munitions launched by the regime on Eastern Ghouta. A third accusation of toxic gas use came from Idlib, an opposition-controlled province in the country’s northwest that also falls in a de-escalation zone. Nearly a dozen people were treated for breathing difficulties on Sunday after Syrian government raids on the town of Saraqeb, the Observatory said. Mohammad Ghaleb Tannari, a doctor in a nearby town, said his hospital had treated 11 people. The US proposed a draft statement condemning the use of chemicals as a weapon, but Syrian government ally Russia added amendments that made no mention of the attack, according to a draft seen by AFP. In the end no statement was adopted. US ambassador Nikki Haley slammed Russia for balking at a statement that she described as a “simple condemnation of Syrian children being suffocated by chlorine gas”. But Russian ambassador Vassily Nebenzia hit back. “It’s completely clear to us the goal is to basically accuse the Syrian government of chemical weapons use where no perpetrators have been identified,” he said. The UN has found that Syria’s government carried out chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015, and also used sarin against a town in Idlib last year. Syria’s government has vehemently denied ever deploying chemical weapons in the country’s seven-year war. More than 340,000 people have been killed in Syria’s conflict, which began with anti-government protests but morphed into an ugly civil war. Thousands of children are among the victims, and the UN’s children agency on Monday decried yet another bloody month for Syria’s children. UNICEF said at least 83 children were killed in conflicts across the Middle East in January, including 59 in Syria alone. In apparent retaliation for Monday’s bombardment, rockets and mortars rained down on government-controlled districts of Damascus, Syria’s state news agency SANA reported. One woman was killed and four people were wounded in mortar fire on the Bab Touma neighbourhood and the capital’s Mariamite Cathedral, a Greek Orthodox church, a police source told the agency. Another person was killed in rocket fire on the regime-held part of Harasta district. Also on Monday, two Canadian citizens who were being held by jihadist factions in the country’s northwest were released to Turkish authorities. Jolly Bimbachi and Sean Moore had crossed into Syria in December 2017 from Lebanon, where Bimbachi was fighting a custody battle for her two sons, she told AFP. They were picked up by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an alliance dominated by Al-Qaeda’s former Syrian affiliate, and handed over to a civilian authority. “They’re going to take us into Turkey, and in Turkey we are going to meet someone from the Canadian embassy,” Bimbachi said."

Tears fall as Maranaos remember Marawi siege	"MARAWI CITY – A year after the breakout of the siege that left this city in heaps of debris and scrap metal, Maranaos on Wednesday gathered in a gymnasium at the provincial capitol to pray and remember the lives lost during the 5-month war in their beloved hometown. During the prayer, 36-year-old Norma Romoro could not help but shed tears as she remembered her elder brother who died after being trapped in Barangay Dansalan, one of the 24 worst hit barangays, in the peak of the firefights between Maute terrorists and government troops. ""Kung hindi siya namatay, ngayon karamay ko pa rin sana siya,"" she told ABS-CBN News, still trying to control her emotions. Apart from her brother, the family also lost their home where she and her sibling had grown up. They are now among the thousands of bakwits (evacuees) waiting for government's plan to help them recover. Romoro shared that she was pregnant when the war broke out on the 23rd of May last year. While rushing out of Marawi, her water broke earlier than scheduled, giving birth to her son, a new source of hope while they lived the temporary lives of bakwits. Jalilah Palala, meanwhile, also shed tears as she prayed for the coming years of her life as an evacuee. She and her family used to live a decent life as sari-sari store owners in Barangay Daguduban before the war in the lakeside city destroyed everything they had worked for. ""Hindi namin makalimutan 'yung nangyari sa amin. Marami sa amin ang hindi maka-move on sa nangyari,"" the mother of three told ABS-CBN News. ""Sana tulungan niya (President Rodrigo Duterte) kaming makabangon, sa pinansyal talaga—puhunan."" As displaced residents sobbed for their loss, Presidential Peace Adviser Jesus Dureza came to extend sympathies on behalf of President Rodrigo Duterte. Dureza, who recently spoke with Duterte, said the President has been planning to visit Marawi but the Chief Executive told him to just extend his sympathies to the Maranaos commemorating the first year of the start of the siege.. ""Nag-extend (ng sympathies) siya dahil plano niya talaga pumunta rito. But he said 'please extend my greetings to them and I'm one [with] them in commemoration [of] what happened,'"" Dureza said in an ambush interview. Special Assistant to the President Christopher Go earlier said Duterte believes the commemoration of the Marawi siege should be in October, when the southern Philippine city was liberated from the clutches of terrorists. Wednesday's prayer gathering was the culmination of the ""week of peace,"" a series of activities initiated by Task Force Bangon Marawi to commemorate the first anniversary of the breakout of the siege. In these events, the task force wanted to emphasize the importance of peace in the community. As early as November last year, residents who lived in barangays outside the most affected areas have started to go home only to find their houses in utter disarray and their hard-earned possessions looted—by terrorists or others, they are uncertain. Meanwhile, thousands of families who hail from 24 barangays that saw the most destruction are still staying in different evacuation centers and temporary shelters as they wait for at least three years for the government to fully rebuild the war-ravaged portion of the city. May they be in tent cities or in temporary shelters, the bakwits all have the same plea— water, cash assistance, a clear plan for the displaced, and the fast-tracking of Marawi's rehabilitation. Some Maranao groups have slammed the government for not including them in the rebuilding plan. They said their proposals, like the scrapping of the proposed military camp in the city, among others, have not been included in what has been presented to them so far. Task Force Bangon Marawi earlier announced that it is in talks with a China-led consortium about the reconstruction of the once-bustling city. The government vowed to speed up their efforts but also appealed for patience among the evacuees. ""You cannot rebuild overnight,"" said Dureza, hoping the displaced residents would understand that the government is doing its best. Around a thousand people, including soldiers, terrorists, and civilians were killed in the 5-month Marawi siege last year. The war between the Islamic State-inspired terrorists and government troops began on May 23, 2017, when authorities attempted to arrest wanted terrorist leader Isnilon Hapilon."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Suspected Iraqi terrorist nabbed in Pampanga	" Dela Rosa says they have not established evidence to implicate the Iraqi national as a suspected terrorist. He adds his entry to the Philippines was during the height of the Marawi siege and ASEAN Summit. @ABSCBNNews pic.twitter.com/i9Mgp1x4xG — Bianca Dava (@biancadava) January 22, 2018 The Iraqi embassy previously alerted the Philippines about the suspect who is allegedly working for the Hamas militant extremist group. According to Dela Rosa, the suspect came to the Philippines in August 2017 during the ASEAN Summit and the Marawi siege. Authorities have yet to determine the suspect's reason for travelling to Manila. Dela Rosa said the suspected terrorist will be deported back to Iraq as he is already overstaying in the country."

"Hearings into Marawi siege cause, rehabilitation sought"	"MANILA, Philippines — An opposition senator is seeking a Senate investigation into the status of rehabilitation efforts in the war-ravaged Marawi City and the circumstances that led to the longest military battle in the country’s history. Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV filed Senate Resolutions 742 and 743 as the Philippines on Wednesday marks a year since the siege that destroyed much of Marawi’s central business district and displaced 250,000 of its residents. “A year after the Marawi siege, the government has yet to present a comprehensive plan on how it intends to rehabilitate the city and assist our kababayans (fellow Filipinos) there,” the senator said. “Worse, its efforts are hampered by a number of issues, from questionable contractors that would rebuild the city, to displacement or land grabbing fears of the affected residents,” he added. Panel asked to check rehabilitation Under Resolution 742, Trillanes is asking the Senate Special Committee on Marawi City Rehabilitation, which was created to monitor the progress of rehabilitation efforts in the town, to probe into the status of reconstruction plans, relief and reconstruction of the city especially the livelihood of the displaced residents. Under the government’s master plan for Marawi rehabilitation, a total of 892 projects were pledged to be rolled out and completed just before President Rodrigo Duterte steps down from office in 2022. However, this master plan is yet to be finalized and framed in loose procurement rules and legal shortcuts, according to an analysis by the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism. PCIJ said that some of the problems rebuilding efforts faced were loopholes in the guidelines on project contract awarding, on-off and token consultations with affected communities, disjointed work by local and national agencies, unsettled land rights and reparation claims and many others. An organization of Marawi evacuees also hit the government for its plans to convert the city to a military reserve and an ecozone. However, Eduardo Del Rosario, the chairman of the Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council, already clarified last month that the suggestion from Philippine Economic Zone Authority chief Jane Plaza to build an economic zone was just an offer and would not be imposed on anyone. Trillanes is also seeking a congressional probe, through the Senate Committee on National Defense and Security, into the circumstances that led to the battle for Marawi to avoid a similar conflict from arising in the future. “Months before the siege, the government knew about the impending crisis. Duterte even challanged the Maute group to burn Marawi. Despite this, the government was not able to prevent the conflict,” Trillanes, former military officer, said. Compensation for displaced sought Sen. Paolo Benigno “Bam” Aquino IV meanwhile is seeking monetary compensation for the affected residents of Marawi City who lost their homes and property during the five-month battle. In his Senate Bill 1816, Aquino said that the remuneration would help the residents to recover from the damage and destruction in their homes and property. “The residents immediately need help from the government for them to recover and return to their normal lives,” Aquino, a member of the Senate panel on Marawi rehabilitation, said in Filipino. The battle for Marawi started on May 23, 2017 after Islamic State-inspired militants from the Maute group tried to take over the city and make it the capital of the province of IS in Southeast Asia. Philippine security personnel and the militants battled for five months, leaving the city in shambles. According to the National Economic Development Authority, more than P50 billion is needed to rehabilitate the lakeside town. Del Rosario meanwhile gave a highter figure last month, saying that the price tag for the efforts will be at least P72 billion. "	Terrorism	Terrorism
PH welcomes designation of Maute group as terrorist organization	"MANILA (UPDATE) - The Philippines on Wednesday welcomed the U.S. Treasury Department's move to include the Maute group on its sanctions list for global terrorism.   ""The Philippine welcomes the US designation of ISIS Philippines and Maute group as foreign terrorist organizations and specially designating global terrorists,"" Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Ernesto Abella said. ""Cooperation with key allies is critical in averting terrorist operations,"" he said. Malacañang meanwhile said Washington's move affirms Manila's belief that the Maute group is composed of local terrorists aided by foreign extremists. ""This likewise recognizes the decisive action we have taken in liberating Marawi from these terrorists, which resulted in the success of the government in thwarting the establishment of an Islamic caliphate in the area and the containing of the rebellion from spreading to other parts of the Philippines,"" Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in a statement Wednesday. The ISIS-inspired Maute group was behind the 5-month siege of Marawi City that ended last October 23, 2017. The fierce battles between government forces and Maute terrorists left a thousand people dead and displaced over 350,000 residents from the city and nearby towns."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Military checking on reported terrorist infiltration in Mindanao waters	"MANILA - The military on Tuesday said it is validating reports that 40 terrorists were able to infiltrate the waters off Southern Philippines. ""We're still closely monitoring. Napakalaki ng ating coastal waters, vast and porous itong ating area. But our forces in Western Mindanao, the Western Mindanao Command and the 1st Infantry Division are closely guarding our coastal waters, southern borders, and these are things that we are closely working [on], together with the Philippine National Police, Philippine Coast Guard,"" said Brig. Gen. Bienvenido Datuin, Commanding-General of the AFP Civil Relations Service. ""...[W]e have established conventions, established agreements, bilateral, bilateral joint patrols with Malaysia, Indonesia, just to secure our waters,"" he said. Philippine National Police chief Director General Ronald Dela Rosa had told reporters Monday that terrorists were able to enter the waters off Mindanao. Dela Rosa gave no further details on the alleged infiltration, on who the terrorists are, their affiliation, and nationalities possibly involved. Mindanao is proximate to coasts of Indonesia and Malaysia. Datuin said nothing is confirmed yet from the military side and that they are still awaiting reports from ground units. Asked if he is aware of reports that recruitment is still on for the Maute group, the Islamic State-linked terror group behind the five-month siege of Marawi City last year, Datuin said the military is still studying the reported recruitment pattern. He added that troops are still on their toes, keeping watch to prevent violent extremism. ""We are studying recruitment patterns and styles, psychology of violent extremism and programs to avoid a repeat of Marawi,"" said Datuin."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Marawi siege was really a prolonged war'	"MANILA- The biggest security crisis to hit the Philippines in 2017 was ""really a prolonged war,"" Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) Assemblyman Zia Alonto Adiong said on Tuesday. Looking back at the bloodshed that claimed over 1,000 lives and forced hundreds of thousands to flee, Adiong said no one thought that the siege would even last for a week, much more 5 months. ""It was really a prolonged war. Nobody was expecting that it would drag on for 5 months...Nobody really expected that the war would go on for even about a week much less 2 weeks,"" he said on ANC's Beyond Politics. On May 23, 2017, Islamic State-inspired extremists laid siege on Marawi City prompting President Rodrigo Duterte to place the entire island of Mindanao under martial law. The war dragged on for months until government troops killed the terrorists' leaders in October. Adiong said it was only later on in the crisis when local officials began to realize how radical ideologies have been quietly spreading across Mindanao, and lamented how little has been done to counter such narratives. ""They (terrorists) have been using experiences of inequality as a common experience among different Muslim countries across the world [in recruiting],"" he said, noting that the Maute group had been searching for members as early as 2011. Adiong conceded that the war was really ""well-planned and well-organized"" for a local terrorist group such as the Maute. Asked on his views on what went wrong in terms of security, Adiong said it is better to focus instead on rebuilding Marawi City rather than point fingers. ""We cannot dwell on the past. Let's move forward. This is a big lesson for our country,"" he said. ""Our focus right now is moving forward. It has already happened, the destruction is already there. We really have to channel our energy towards the rehabilitation of Marawi,"" he added."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Sri Mulyani says terrorist attacks 'will not affect investment'	"Finance Minister Sri Mulyani has expressed confidence that the recent bombings on churches in Surabaya will not deter investors from investing in the country as the law enforcers have started to seriously deal with the issue. “We hope that law enforcement will restore perception and trust in Indonesia,” said Sri Mulyani over the weekend in Jakarta as reported tribunnews.com Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (Indef) economist Bima Yudhistira made a similar comment, saying that the sooner law enforcement officers could arrest the suspects, the better it would be for the investment climate. Suicide bombers attacked three churches in Surabaya on Sunday, killing 14 people and wounding at least 41 others. The attacks occurred days after the riot and prison siege at the National Police's Mobile Brigade headquarters (Mako Brimob) detention center in Depok, West Java last week, in which five police officers and one detainee were killed. “But if the incident is not handled properly by law enforcement, it may affect negatively [on investor confidence],” Bima said in Jakarta on Sunday  as reported by kompas.com. Bima added that security was one of the key considerations among investors, but that the fatal Mako Brimob riot had insignificant impact, with the rupiah even strengthening to Rp 13,900 against US dollar from Rp 14,000 earlier last week. “It means that investors might be taking [the incident] into consideration, but they are taking the global economy into greater consideration, particularly the United States’ economic policy,” said Bima, adding that investors would also be watching Bank Indonesia’s decision on its reference rate.

"Possible remnants of Maute, terrorist groups still recruiting — Bautista"	"Philippine Army chief Lt. Gen. Rolando Bautista has confirmed that possible remnants and supporters of the Maute Group and other local terrorist groups continuously recruit for new members to launch a future attack similar to what happened to Marawi City last year. Bautista made the revelation in an interview during the Army-Media Fellowship Night held at the Army headquarters in Fort Bonifacio, Makati City on Friday night. He said they continue to get numerous information that the recruitment continues and that foreign fighters have also arrived to join their local counterparts. “Actually expected iyun ano (we already expected that). In fact after the Marawi liberation again its common action that supporters who are inside, the enemy whom we already neutralized and we have received reports that the recruitment is not limited within Lanao del Sur,” Bautista said. “But it also continued in the area of Basilan, Sulu and even in the area of Palimbang,” he added. Bautista said if one will observe prior to the Marawi siege, different terrorist groups united under the leadership of the late Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon to establish a caliphate state in Southeast Asia. “And we all know that they have support coming from the different leaderships particularly in Indonesia and Malaysia and there were reports which are still being validated that they entered through the southern backdoor and even in Metro Manila there are but we were able to identify them and at the same time actions were taken by the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the concentration right now is in Central Mindanao,” Bautista said. He said if one will talk of Central Mindanao or local terrorist group in Central Mindanao, the BIFF or the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters comes to mind. “Some local terrorist groups will unite with the BIFF as the area in Central Mindanao besides sa hindi masyado yung sundalo (there are less soldiers) and their movement in the area is malaki (big) so they take advantage of that,” Bautista said. Bautista said the recruitment and threat continues and the possibility that terrorists will occupy or lay siege to another city is there. “There is a threat, the recruitment continues so meaningful to say if the recruitment continues there is still a possibility that they will lay siege or occupy another city, not particularly Marawi City. That is a big possibility that is why the rehabilitation of Marawi City continuous,” he said. Bautista said part of the recruitment is how they see the progress of the rehabilitation of Marawi will develop in the coming months."	Terrorism	Terrorism
Suspected Pakistani terrorist denied entry anew	"MANILA, Philippines — The Bureau of Immigration (BI) has barred a Pakistani man, believed to be an Islamic State (IS) trainer, from entering the country for the second time. Naeem Hussain, 36, was intercepted by BI agents at the Clark International Airport in Pampanga on Sept. 22, Immigration Commissioner Jaime Morente confirmed yesterday. Hussain had arrived on an Emirates Airlines flight from Dubai, according to Morente. BI officer-in-charge Deputy Commissioner Marc Red Mariñas said this was the second attempt of Hussain to enter the Philippines. BI records showed that the suspected terrorist was first intercepted at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport last May. “He was turned away because he is on our alert list of suspected international terrorists for being an alleged trainer of Daesh,” Morente said. Hussain was immediately excluded and booked on the first available flight to his country of origin. Daesh is also known as IS or Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Its members have been waging war against the United States and its coalition partners in Iraq and Syria, where the terrorist group wants to establish an Islamic caliphate. Hussain was on the watchlist of the military, which sought the BI’s help in monitoring the Pakistani’s possible entry into the country. During questioning, Hussain claimed that he has been working as a digital designer. He said he traveled to the Philippines to visit his Filipina girlfriend, who lives in Olongapo City. 30-day detention for terror suspects backed Senators are supporting the proposal of security officials to extend to 30 days the detention of terror suspects arrested without warrants and other amendments under a strengthened Human Security Act (HSA). Security and military officials made their pitch to amend the HSA during the Senate hearing on various bills, which seek to strengthen the 11-year-old anti-terrorism law jointly held by the committees on public order and dangerous drugs; national defense and security; justice and human rights, and finance. Sen. Panfilo Lacson, who chairs the public order committee, described the HSA as “a dead-letter law” and the “weakest” of its kind in the region. “For one, no person or organization has ever been prosecuted under the HSA in the past 11 years. In fact, what may be considered the first and only implementation of that act was the proscription of the Abu Sayyaf as a terrorist organization by the regional trial court in Isabela City, Basilan,” he said. Lacson cited the case of Australia, which has enacted 61 anti-terror measures since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the US, to keep up with the growing sophistication of terror threats. He said the country should learn its lesson from the Marawi siege. He added that martial law currently imposed over Mindanao is practically toothless. Under the anti-terrorism law, suspects may “not be detained for more than three days without the written approval of a municipal, city, provincial or regional official of a Human Rights Commission or judge of the municipal, regional trial court, the Sandiganbayan or a justice of the Court of Appeals nearest the place of the arrest.” – With Paolo Romero "	Terrorism	Terrorism
